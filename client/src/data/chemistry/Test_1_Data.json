Remember, two moles of NaOH is required to neutralize one mole of H 2 SO 4 . moles of NaOH = (0.0375 mol) (2) = 0.0750 mol STEP 4: Lastly, we can calculate the volume of NaOH required.

      "concept_text": "STEP 1: To determine the answer to this question, we need to first find out the limiting reagent. Since HCl is in excess, Al will be the limiting reagent . Remember, the limiting reagent is what determines the extent to which the reaction would proceed. STEP 2: Now we can calculate the number of moles of Al below. moles of Al = (mass) / (molar mass) moles of Al = (15g) / (27g/mol) STEP 3: Next, we can determine how many moles of hydrogen is present relative to the number of aluminum moles. Keep in mind, there are 3 moles of hydrogen for every 2 moles of aluminum. moles of hydrogen = moles of Al x (mole ratio of H to Al) moles of hydrogen = (15/27) x (3 mol H 2 /2 mol Al) = (15)(3) / (27)(2) STEP 4: Lastly, we can calculate the grams of hydrogen below. grams of hydrogen = moles of hydrogen x molar mass grams of hydrogen = [(15)(3) / (27)(2)] x 2 = (15)(3) / (27) We can also solve this using an alternative method involving ratios, called dimensional analysis. The ratios should be arranged such that the unit present in the numerator of the first ratio is cancelled with the unit present in the denominator of the next ratio. Conversions continue until all units are cancelled out and only the desired unit remains. Therefore, the correct answer is D .",

If a diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same element, such as hydrogen (H 2 ) or oxygen (O 2 ), then it is said to be homonuclear . If a diatomic molecule consists of two different atoms, such as carbon monoxide (CO), the molecule is said to be heteronuclear. Seven elements exist as diatomic molecules in their standard elemental state in the periodic table, as shown in the image below. These seven elements are: hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Atoms of these elements form covalently bonded pairs by sharing valence electrons and occur naturally as H 2 , N 2 , O 2 , F 2 , Cl 2 , Br 2 , and I 2 , respectively. Due to differences in orbitals and the number of valence electrons, H 2 , F 2 , Cl 2 , Br 2 , and I 2 can achieve a full valence shell by forming a pair with only a single covalent bond, but O 2 must form a double bond and N 2 must form a triple bond. An easy way to remember the 7 elements is through the following mnemonic: H 2 , N 2 , F 2, O 2 , I 2 , Cl 2 , Br 2 . \" H ave N o F ear O f I ce C old B eer\" CC By 4.0",

The acidic component of a buffer can neutralize an added base while the basic component of a buffer can neutralize an added acid. This means that large changes in pH will be repressed. For example, CH 3 COOH is a weak acid, and its conjugate base is CH 3 COO − . As such, a buffer could be made by mixing equal concentrations of each into solution. Typically, weak bases and their conjugate are found in alkaline (pH > 7) solutions, while weak acids and their conjugates are found in acidic (pH < 7) solutions.

      "concept_text": "Le Chatelier’s principle states that if a system that is in equilibrium is disturbed by changes in temperature, pressure, and concentration of components, the system will tend to shift its equilibrium position so as to counteract the effect of the disturbance. MgO ( s ) + CO 2( g ) ↔ MgCO 3( s ) ∆H = +118 kJ • mol -1 In this case, increasing the volume of the system would result in an equilibrium shift towards the reactants because this system involves gas molecules, and therefore an increase in the volume is accompanied by a decrease in pressure and concentration. To understand this concept, imagine the gas molecules are allowed to expand further and are less confined. According to Le Chatelier’s principle, the system will try to counteract this change by shifting the equilibrium to increase the number of gas molecules. This would mean that the shift would be aim towards the side of the reaction with more gas molecules. Therefore, the equilibrium will shift towards the reactant side in the reaction above, and this makes Option D. Increasing the volume of the system is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Increasing the temperature of the system – This option is incorrect because the enthalpy change for the reaction is positive, indicating that it is an endothermic process. When there is an increase in the temperature, more heat is available to the reactants to enable them to progress in the forward direction. This results in the equilibrium shift to the right towards producing more products. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option B. Adding more MgCO 3 ( s ) to the equilibrium – This option is incorrect . According to Le Chatelier’s principle, the system will try to counteract the change by shifting the equilibrium to remove the change. When MgCO 3( s ) is added, it may seem intuitive that the system will shift to the left, given more MgCO 3 are present. However, MgCO 3( s ) is a solid and adding more solid does not change the density or concentration. Therefore, this addition does not affect the equilibrium. This makes this option incorrect. Option C. Increasing the pressure of the system – This option is incorrect because increasing the pressure of the system would increase the concentration of gas molecules. According to Le Chatelier’s principle, the system will try to counteract this change by shifting the equilibrium to decrease the number of gas molecules. This would shift the reaction towards reducing the number of gas molecules, which is to the right of the reaction. Thus, makes this option incorrect.",

The molecules upon which enzymes act are called substrates and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products . A catalyst is specific for a specific reaction ( lock-and-key mechanism ) and is neither a product or reactant as it does not change in the reaction. These are important properties of enzymes/catalysts that you must know for the Canadian DAT. Firstly, catalysts change the rate constant of a reaction. Recall, the rate constant of a reaction is increased by the presence of an enzyme, not decreased. This can be inferred from the Arrhenius equation, where the rate is dependent on the activation energy. Since the activation energy is lowered by the enzyme, then the rate constant is subsequently increased.",

      "concept_text": "To determine the equivalent resonance structures , we must first determine the number of valence electrons. By looking at the periodic table, we can see that carbon belongs to Group 4, while oxygen belongs to Group 6A. Since the group number represents the number of outermost electrons, we know that carbon has 4 valence electrons while oxygen has 6 valence electrons. Now that we know the number of valence electrons per element, we need to compute the total number of valence electrons: 4 + (3 x 6) = 22 electrons Note : Since the whole molecule has a -2 charge, we need to keep this into consideration as well. Therefore, the total number of valence electrons is: 22 + 2 = 24 electrons Now that we have the total valence electrons, we can draw out all the possible resonance structures of CO 3 2- without violating the octet rule. By doing this, we determine that there are THREE possible resonance structures can be drawn for carbonate ions, CO 3 2- as shown below: CC By 4.0",

There are many different types radioactive decay that may occur depending on the size of the nuclei and whether the instability is due to an abundance of protons or neutrons. The various types of radioactive decay are summarized in the table below. In this question, we can see that Thorium (Th) undergoes Beta decay . In this process, a neutron is converted into a proton and a negative charge is expelled. As a result, the atomic number of the element increases by 1. Since the atomic number (or the number of protons) changes, so does the element. This leads to the formation of the element with an atomic number of 91, which is called Protactinium (Pa) - Option A. CC By 4.0 Note : For Beta decay, the mass number does NOT change because one component (neutron) is converted to another component with roughly the same mass (proton).",
