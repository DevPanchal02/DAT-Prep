Therefore, K a is a measurement of the strength of acidity of a molecule and is sometimes represented by pK a = –logK a . The higher the K a or the lower the pK a , the stronger the acid. Of all the acids, HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4 are both strong acids. To determine which one is stronger, the one with the higher K a is stronger, which is H 2 SO 4 .

The boiling point of the liquid increases – This option is incorrect because boiling point is a colligative property that changes only when the concentration of the solutes in the solvent changes.",

      "concept_text": "In a heating curve, a pure substance must overcome intermolecular forces in order to go through phase changes. There are two types of transitions when calculating the heat absorbed: calorimetry and enthalpy. Calorimetry corresponds to the portions of the graph with sloped lines (single phase: solid, liquid, gas). Enthalpy corresponds to portions of the graph with horizontal lines (phase transitions: melting (solid → liquid) and boiling (liquid → gas)). In the question, the red arrow indicates liquid to gas transition, which is also called vaporization. Remember that during phase changes, such as fusion and vaporization, the temperature does not change (which explains why the line is horizontal). Phase transitions occur at a constant temperature, because all the energy is used to break intermolecular forces holding the solid together during fusion, and those holding the liquid together during vaporization. Only after the phase transition does any additional heat increase the kinetic energy of the particles and temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is Option D . CC BY 4.0",

Start by counting the overall molar amounts of each element: STEP 3 : It is clear that there are too few hydrogens on the right side of the arrow (2) as compared to the left side (4), so this must be remedied by doubling the amount of water, yielding the following table of elements: O 2 + CH 4 → CO 2 + 2H 2 O STEP 4: To balance the extra two oxygens on the right side of the arrow, the oxygen gas molar amount must be doubled to complete the balancing. From the completed equation, it can be seen that 2 mol of O 2 is required for this reaction. 2 O 2 + CH 4 → CO 2 + 2 H 2 O CC BY 4.0",

Ionization energy is defined as the energy required to remove an outermost electron from an atom. This feat is easier to accomplish in atoms found at the bottom of the periodic table because there are many levels of electrons shielding the negatively charged electrons in the outermost valence layer from the positive nucleus. Additionally, in large atoms, this valence shell is found at a farther distance from the nucleus as a result of a larger atomic radius. Both the increased shielding and further distance weaken the attraction between the positive nucleus and negative electrons which allows for electrons to be removed with less energy further down in a column. From the options provided, Po has the lowest first ionization energy, therefore the correct answer is Option E . CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. O - This option is incorrect because oxygen is the smallest of the options. As a result, oxygen has the weakest electron shielding and the smallest distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. This results in a strong attraction between the positive nucleus and negative electrons which makes it very hard to remove an electron and ionize the atom. Option B. S - This option is incorrect because sulfur does not have the largest size of options listed. As a result, it does not have the most electron shielding or the largest distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. Therefore, it does not have the weakest ionization energy. Option C. Se - This option is incorrect because selenium is not the largest element listed. Therefore, it does not have the maximum amount of electron shielding or radius size required in order for it to be ionized with the least amount of energy. Option D. Te - This option is incorrect because tellurium is found above polonium on the periodic table. Therefore, this element does not have the largest atomic radius or greatest amount of electron shielding between valence electrons and the nucleus. Electrons are consequently not removed more easily on this atom than polonium and therefore it does not have the smallest ionization energy.",

The second trend of interest is that electronegativity increases toward the top of the periodic table because these atoms have a smaller radius and therefore the positive nucleus is physically closer to electrons that it pulls upon. CC BY 4.0 It is important to also note that noble gases (group VIII) have very low electronegativity values (effectively zero in the first rows) because their valence electron subshell is already full and therefore any additional electrons added will be very unstable and readily lost. The lowest electronegativity value out of the options listed must therefore belong to helium, a noble gas. The largest electronegativity value must belong to fluorine, which resides at the top-most and right-most corner of the periodic table. Finally, as a result of previously discussed trends, oxygen must be placed after nitrogen because it resides further right on the periodic table. This leaves the correct choice as Option A.

Although electronegativity values would be useful in determining the dipole moment of a molecule, we can arrive at the answer by focusing on the periodic trend of electronegativity combined with molecular geometry. In the case of carbon disulfide, it can be confirmed that this structure is nonpolar because the overall structure is linear and therefore any polarities between the carbon and sulfur are geographically balanced as they pull in opposite directions. In drawing this structure, carbon donates four valence electrons while each sulfur donates six (sixteen total). Therefore, the overall Lewis structure requires two double bonds to be made to create the overall linear shape with no formal charges on any atoms.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. H 2 O - This option is incorrect because there is a geographic imbalance of the polar bonds due to the bent molecular geometry. The electrons are pulled unevenly towards the oxygen, and the molecule is overall polar. Option B. NH 3 - This option is incorrect because although NH 3 has a tetrahedral arrangement, the electronegativity difference between the nitrogen and the hydrogen atoms create an uneven pull that favours the nitrogen atom. Furthermore, the presence of lone pair does not allow the net cancelling of the dipole moments for each bond. This option is incorrect as electron density is not pulled equally in all directions. Option C. CH 3 Cl - This option is incorrect because the groups coming off of carbon do not geographically balance one another. The groups are not balanced as the hydrogens - which are the least electronegative atom - branching from the carbon pull very weakly on the electrons while the more electronegative chlorine pulls very strongly. As a result, the electron density is pulled toward the chlorine, causing the molecule to be overall polar. Option E. HF - This option is incorrect because the electron density is very unbalanced in this molecule as a result of fluorine’s high electronegativity compared to hydrogen’s. This difference in electronegativity results in electron density being heavily pulled towards fluorine in this polar bond, causing an overall dipole moment to form.",

      "concept_text": "STEP 1: To answer this question, an understanding of polarity is required. Polarity occurs when a molecular dipole moment exists in a molecule as a result of unbalanced electron density. This area of unequal electron density can exist as a result of electronegativity differences between bonds (a value greater than 0.4) coupled with a non-geographical distribution of polar groups. Note: Remember electronegativity trends indicate that electronegativity increases from left to right across rows and from bottom to top through columns. STEP 2: The easiest way to solve this question is to focus on the strongly electronegative oxygen molecule found in methanol, or CH 3 OH. Methanol is a very small molecule, and the electron density is pulled away from the carbon, an atom with a relatively small electronegativity value (2.5), to the oxygen, which possesses a very high electronegativity value (3.5). This imbalance in electronegativity (3.5 – 2.5 = 1 > 0.4) is not geographically balanced by the other hydrogens which bond to the carbon and therefore this molecule is considered polar. Note: This electronegativity difference is also seen in the intermolecular attractions formed by methanol. Hydrogen bonds occur when hydrogens are bonded to oxygen, nitrogen, or fluoride because these hydrogens lose so much electron density that they become partially positive and form very strong attractions with highly electronegative atoms on surrounding molecules.
