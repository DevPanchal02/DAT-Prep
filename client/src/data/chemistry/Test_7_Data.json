      "concept_text": "Electron configuration is the distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule in atomic or molecular orbitals. The first three orbitals are the s, p and d orbitals which hold 2, 6, and 10 electrons respectively. When we try to solve this question, at first glance the electron configuration of molybdenum appears to be: 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 2 3p 6 4s 2 3d 10 4p 6 5s 2 4d 4 or [Kr] 5s 2 4d 4 However, there are certain elements that have special exceptions, molybdenum being one of them since it is a transition metal . Transition metals such as molybdenum need an electron to fill their d- orbitals because it is energetically favourable to have a half full d- orbital; they get this electron from the full s- orbital. This occurs because elements with either half or full sub-orbitals are more stable than if they were empty orbitals. Therefore, we take the original electron configuration of [Kr] 5s 2 4d 4 , and we remove one electron from the 5 s and add it to the 4d- orbital, to get: 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 2 3p 6 4s 2 3d 10 4p 6 5s 1 4d 5 or [Kr] 5s 1 4d 5 This effectively results in a partial occupancy of the s- orbital and a full d- orbital. The same rule can be applied to the 4th group which are the transition metals with 4 electrons in their d- orbitals.

      "concept_text": "To determine the answer to this question, we must understand different laboratory safety. One of which is that chemicals need to be measured accurately, otherwise, they may be too weak or too strong and can become a safety hazard. When measuring solids like powders and granules, you should use a scoop or measuring spoon to place the substance in to a small container that has already been weighed on the scale beforehand. When measuring liquids on a scale, always measure the substance on a flat surface and make sure to slowly pour the substance into a cup, glass or cylinder tube until you have the correct weight. In either case, it is very important that you do not place/pour the chemical directly on to the scale without any containers since you could get an inaccurate reading and is also a safety hazard. Based on this, the answer would be Option A. measure directly on the scale .",

Tare the scale each time – This option is incorrect because this will take into account the weight of the tray, which is an important step to perform before adding weight. Option C.

Place the sample in a container before measuring – This option is incorrect because in addition to being safe, this will prevent spilling and increase accuracy. Option E . Wear personal protective equipment – This option is incorrect because this should always be done when handling chemical compounds.",

In contrast, a reducing agent is a substance that loses an electron to an electron recipient in a redox chemical reaction; in other words, it loses electrons and is oxidized in a chemical reaction. Going back to the question, we must begin by assigning oxidation numbers. Remember, hydrogen is +1 when bound to a non-metal, oxygen is usually -2 (unless in a peroxide), an element in elemental form (i.e. I 2 ) is 0, and any remaining oxidation numbers must calculated such that the total sum of the numbers equal the charge on the molecule: H 2 O  +  SO 2 + I 2 H 2 SO 4 + 2HI +1 -2   +4 -2     0       +1 +6 -2    +1 -1 In the above schematic, we can see that the oxidation numbers for Sulfur and Iodine undergo a change. Between SO 2 and H 2 SO 4 , the oxidation number on S increases from +4 to +6 which represents a loss of electrons (oxidation). Between I 2 and HI, the oxidation number is reduced from 0 to -1 which represents a gain of electrons (reduction).

One type of electrochemical cell is a galvanic cell, also called a voltaic cell, which is shown in the image below. Galvanic cells derive electrical energy from spontaneous redox (reduction and oxidation) reactions. This is in contrast to electrolytic cells , where instead, electrical energy is being used to drive a reaction. In both cells, electrons flow from the anode to cathode, where reduction always takes place at the cathode. The key difference between these cells is that in a galvanic cell, the anode is negative while the cathode is positive; the reverse is true in an electrolytic cell. CC BY 4.0",

      "concept_text": "The melting point is the temperature at which a given solid will melt. It is primarily determined by the compound's intermolecular forces , which are the interactions that occur between molecules and neighboring particles. Stronger intermolecular forces mean increased interactions holding a substance together. Thus, stronger intermolecular forces result in a higher melting point, boiling point, viscosity, and surface tension, but a lower vapor pressure. The typical order of the strength of intermolecular forces is shown below: Ion-dipole forces > Hydrogen bonds > Dipole-dipole forces > London dispersion forces However, the molecular weight can also play an important role in determining the melting point. When the molecular weight of a molecule increases, the number of electrons within the molecule also increases. Having a larger electron cloud means that the molecule is more polarizable, and therefore there is an increase in the strength of London dispersion forces. Going back to the question, given that there is a large difference in molecular weights between the four compounds, the determining factor is the molecular weight rather than polarity. From the option choices, CBr 4 has the highest molecular weight (332 g/mol) compared to the other compounds, giving it relatively strong London Dispersion forces. Therefore, the answer is Option E. CBr 4 as it has the strongest intermolecular forces and thus, the highest melting point.",

      "concept_text": "Diamagnetism results when an external magnetic field induces the electronic cloud to shift in such a way to generate an opposing magnetic field. This causes a weak repulsion of the material from the magnet. Since diamagnetism results from an induced magnetic field, all atoms or molecules with any paired electrons will exhibit diamagnetism. Paramagnetism results when an atom or molecule has any unpaired electrons. In this case, the unpaired electrons align themselves with an external magnetic field that generates an attractive force that greatly counteracts the weaker repulsion effect of diamagnetism. We recognize that hydrogen has a single electron in the 1s orbital. Atomic hydrogen would therefore be paramagnetic due to this unpaired electron. However, in anionic hydrogen, there is an extra electron resulting in a fully filled 1s orbital. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B.",
