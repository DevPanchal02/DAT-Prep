We know that the rate must be in units of M/s and that each concentration is in units M. Based on this, we can determine the units of k for this question so that the units on the left- and right-hand side are equal: Rate = k[A][B] (M s -1 ) = (units of k) (M) (M) Units of k = (M s -1 )/(M)(M) Units of k = (s -1 )/(M) = M -1 s -1",

The osmotic pressure is the pressure necessary to resist this flow. CC BY 4.0",

This can be determined through dimensional analysis. We know osmotic pressure must have the units in atm so the form of the ideal gas constant must facilitate the elimination of other units. Only the 0.0821 L•atm/K•mol form yields the desired value in atms. Option B. 5.5 atm – This option is incorrect because dimensional analysis gives the opportunity for a quick sanity check in case one does not remember the exact equation. From this, it can be determined that the only way to obtain a value with the units atm is by multiplying the unitless van’t Hoff factor, the molar concentration with units M or mol/L, the ideal case constant with units L•atm/K•mol, and the temperature with units K. Option D. 71 atm – This option is incorrect because the temperature units are already given in Kelvin so no conversion is necessary. Option E. 74 atm – This option is incorrect because sucrose will not dissociate into more particles in an aqueous solution unlike salts or strong acids. Therefore, the van’t Hoff index is 1. A salt such as NaCl would dissociate into 2 ions so its van’t Hoff index is 2.",

      "concept_text": "Intermolecular forces are the interactions that occur between molecules and neighbouring particles, such as forces of attraction. Weaker intermolecular forces mean reduced interactions holding a substance together. Vapor pressure refers to the pressure exerted by a gas in equilibrium with the solid or liquid form of the same substance, in a closed system. For a substance to vaporize, the intermolecular forces need to be disrupted which requires energy. The weaker these forces, the less energy that is required to break them. Hence, with weaker intermolecular interactions, a greater amount of the substance is able to “escape” and go in gaseous form, indicating a higher vapor pressure. To help visualize this concept, take a look at the image shown below. Liquid B has weaker intermolecular forces, therefore the interactions are able to break apart more easily, allowing particles to escape as gas. However, this results in more gas particles within the closed system, and thereby a higher vapor pressure. CC BY 4.0 Canadian DAT Pro Tip: Stronger intermolecular forces mean increased interactions holding a substance together. Thus, stronger intermolecular forces result in a higher melting point, boiling point, viscosity, and surface tension, but a lower vapor pressure.",

      "concept_text": "When comparing acid strengths, the strength of an acid depends on the dissociation constant, not the concentration. The dissociation constant describes the tendency of the acid to dissociate into ions, releasing a hydrogen. Therefore, the larger the dissociation constant, the stronger the acid is. For example, HBr is a stronger acid than HF because bromine has a larger atomic radius than fluorine. This causes the bond length in HBr to be longer than the bond length in HF as shown in the image below; therefore, it is more likely for H + to dissociate from HBr. The Br – ion can also delocalize the negative charge more than the F – ion can because of its larger size. CC BY 4.0 For the Canadian DAT, it is important to know that there are 7 common strong acids: Binary acid strength increases from LEFT to RIGHT across a period in the periodic table and from TOP to BOTTOM in a column. From left to right, electronegativity increases meaning the bond becomes more polarized. From top to bottom, size increases, meaning the bond size increases and the bond becomes weaker and easier to break. Oxyacids are molecules that contains a hydrogen, oxygen, and a third element. The primary factor determining the acidity is the number of oxygens. The more oxygen atoms there are, the more stable is the conjugate base as the charge can be spread around through resonance. From the option choices given, we see that Option C. HF is not one of the 7 strong acids, therefore it is the correct answer.",

Keep in mind, a linear molecule must either have two bonding regions on the central atom or be made up just two atoms (i.e. Cl 2 ). To start, we must begin by drawing the VESPR diagram of XeF 2 : STEP 2: By drawing out the VESPR diagram, we can see there are three electron pairs on the central atom. Therefore, XeF 2 is linear (the electrons pairs form a plane with the two F’s sticking straight out above and below that plane).",

H 2 O – This option is incorrect because this molecule has a bent geometry, having two lone pairs on the oxygen as shown below. If you recognize that water is a polar molecule, and is thus not linear, you should therefore be able to eliminate this answer without having to draw its Lewis structure. Option E.
