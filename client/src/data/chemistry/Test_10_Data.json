A battery is an electrochemical cell with a positive terminal ( cathode ) and a negative terminal ( anode ) that supplies electric power (dependent on its voltage ) by conducting electrons from anode to the cathode through the circuit it is connected to. The redox reaction in which a battery is supplying electric power is undergoing an energy conversion from chemical to electric due to a transfer of electrons from each half-cell (chemical) to provide current for the board (electrical). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A .",

      "concept_text": "For Canadian DAT, it is important to know that elements that are highly reducing (i.e., alkali metals and alkaline earth metals) are ones that are highly reactive in water. They react according to the following chemical equation. Alkali Metals: 2 M (s) + 2H 2 O (l) → 2 MOH (aq) + H 2 (g) Alkaline Earth Metals: M (s) +2 H 2 O (l) → M(OH) 2 (aq) + H 2 (g) The reason why these metals are highly reactive with water is that they will combust to form metal hydroxides and hydrogen gas, both of which will produce highly vigorous exothermic reaction when exposed to water vapor. Between the alkali metals and alkaline metals, alkali metals are more reactive. Therefore, the correct answer is Option E .",

There are two types of transitions when calculating the heat absorbed: calorimetry and enthalpy. Calorimetry corresponds to the portions of graph with sloped lines (single-phase: solid, liquid, gas). Enthalpy corresponds to portions of the graph with horizontal lines (phase transitions: melting (solid → liquid) and boiling (liquid → gas)). Because the boiling requires higher heat to be absorbed due to the complete dissolution of intermolecular forces than melting, .

In an exothermic reaction, energy is released because the total energy of the products is less than the total energy of the reactants. Fusion , vaporization , and sublimation are endothermic processes, whereas freezing , condensation , and deposition are exothermic processes. Changes of state are examples of phase changes. It's important to know that all phase changes are accompanied by changes in the energy of a system. Changes from a more-ordered state to a less-ordered state (such as a liquid to a gas) are endothermic.

This means that the two atoms must have a difference in electronegativity of 0.4 to 1.8 so that one molecule pulls on electrons harder than the other but is not pulling so strongly that the bond becomes ionic. STEP 1: In the case of NH 3 , or ammonia, nitrogen has an electronegativity of about 3.0 while hydrogen is about 2.1. Therefore, the electronegativity difference is 0.9 (3.0 – 2.9). Since 0.9 falls between 0.4 and 1.8, the first criteria is met. STEP 2: Now, it must be confirmed that the dipole moments are not geographically balanced, otherwise the overall molecule would not be polar. A Lewis structure of the eight valence electrons (five from nitrogen, one from each of the three hydrogens) from ammonia can be built, displaying that nitrogen does not need double or triple bonds and can thus remain in a tetrahedral shape: Step 3: Finally, it can be seen that the lone pair of electrons is not geographically balanced with another lone pair across from it and therefore the overall molecule is polar.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. BF 3 - This option is incorrect because there is geographic balance for the polar bonds. The electronegativity difference between boron (2.0) and fluorine (4.0) gives the bonds a polar character (4.0 - 2.0 = 2.0 > 1.8), but the molecule is trigonal planar with three identical groups. Therefore, the bonds all cancel each other out as they pull equally in opposing directions. Option B. Si(CH 3 ) 4 - This option is incorrect because there is no net dipole in the molecule since the four methyl groups all pull equally in four geographically opposing directions. Therefore, although the carbon (2.5) and silane (1.8) atoms have an electronegativity difference that makes them polar (2.5 – 1.8 = 0.7 > 0.4), the overall molecule does not have a dipole moment as the identical side groups of the tetrahedral shape pull equally in 4 different directions. Option C. CO 2 - This option is incorrect because the molecule is linear with identical side groups on the carbon, therefore the dipole moments of the bonds are pulled in geographically opposing directions and cancel each other out. The individual bonds between oxygen (3.5) and carbon (2.5) are polar (3.5 – 2.5 = 1.0 > 0.4). Option E. C 6 H 6 - This option is incorrect because this formula indicates benzene which is made up of all carbon and hydrogen atoms. Carbon to carbon bonds have no electronegativity difference and carbon (2.5) to hydrogen (2.1) bonds are not polar as their electronegativity difference is not greater than 0.4 (2.5 – 2.1 = 0.4). Therefore, the molecule cannot have an overall dipole moment.",

Thus, the total number of valence electrons must be 16 : 2 * 6 + 4 = 16 STEP 3: Draw the basic structure of the molecule and fill in electrons to complete an octet for all atoms. Count the total electrons by counting each dot as 1 and each bond as 2. This gives us 20 electrons: STEP 4: Because this structure has too many electrons, the total amount must be reduced by adding double or triple bonds. For every double or triple bond, the total number of electrons will be reduced by 2.  By adding two extra bonds to reduce the electron number to 16 (20 – 2 – 2 = 16), two possible options remain: STEP 5: Next, formal charge must be accounted for in order to eliminate a structure. Formal charge is calculated by the following formula: Formal Charge = Valence Electrons - Bonds - Free Electrons STEP 6: Finally, the structure with the least number of atoms carrying a formal charge must be chosen. In the following structure, all atoms have no formal charge, therefore, it is the correct Lewis structure:",

Higher atomic number species have more protons so they will attract electrons more tightly than another isoelectronic species with fewer protons which decreases their radii.

This is defined as the net positive charge that electrons feel and is equal to the number of protons minus the shielding constant which is generally related to the number of inner electrons. Since isoelectronic species have the same electronic configuration, the shielding constant is comparable among isoelectronic species.

In this type of decay, a proton is converted to a neutron and consequently releases a positron. Atomic mass is unchanged. Option B. Gamma ray - This option is incorrect because gamma rays (γ) do not contain any mass and therefore their loss does not affect the overall mass of the nucleus. In gamma decay, the nucleus moves from an excited state (*) to a non-excited state. Option C. Helium nucleus - This option is incorrect because a helium nucleus decay pattern would result in a decrease in the atomic mass by 4 and a decrease in the atomic number by 2. The loss of a helium nucleus ( 4 / 2 He) is known as alpha decay. Option E. Proton - This option is incorrect because the loss of a proton ( 1 / 1 H) would result in a loss of one for the values of the atomic number and atomic mass rather than atomic number alone.

The composition of different colloids (e.g. brands of milk) is rarely identical. Option C. Heterogenous mixture - This option is incorrect because solutes in this mixture type are not uniformly dispersed. For example, if a chocolate chip cookie was sampled by cutting it into fourths, each piece would have a different composition (e.g. number of chocolate chips per quarter). Option D.
