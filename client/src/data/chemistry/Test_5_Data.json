      "concept_text": "An effective indicator for a titration experiment is one that has a pH range that includes the endpoint. Recall, the end point is where the indicator just changes color, which is basically the equivalence point where the moles of titrant equals the moles of solution of unknown concentration. Often, the indicator’s color at endpoint is a mixture between the color at a pH lower than the range and the color at a pH higher than the range. Returning back to the question, based on the information provided, we can be determine that the pH at endpoint is between 4.2 and 6.3 because the solution changes Methyl red to an orange color. This eliminates all of the option choices except for option A and option B. Option B is incorrect because if the pH at endpoint is 6.1, then the Bromocresol Purple would likely be an intermediate color between yellow and purple. Therefore, the answer is Option A. the pH at endpoint is 4.8 .",

It can also be defined as the energy required to break apart a chemical bond. Remember, bond breaking is an endothermic process as energy is required, while forming bonds is an exothermic process as energy is released. A bond can contain either a sigma bond OR both sigma and pi bonds. The overall energy of a bond is the sum of the energies of all sigma and pi bonding contributors. When comparing single, double, and triple covalent bonds involving the same two types of atoms, the overall bond energy tends to increase with each additional pi bond.

      "concept_text": "Electron configuration is the distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule in atomic or molecular orbitals. The first three orbitals are the s , p and d orbitals which hold 2, 6, and 10 electrons respectively. When trying to solve this question, the most important rule to keep in mind is that electrons will fill the lower orbitals first before going to the next higher orbital. Hence, the electrons will fill the orbitals in the following order: 1 s , 2 s , 2 p , 3 s , 3 p , 4 s , 3 d , 4 p , 5 s , 4 d , 5 p , 6 s , 4 f , 5 d , and 6 p Now, when we try writing the electronic configuration for Bromine, we get: [Ar] 4 s 2 3 d 10 4 p 5 However, bromine has a negative charge in the given question. Since the 4p sub-level needs one more electron to fill it up completely, the electron will be placed there. This is because when adding electrons to form negative ions, the electrons are added to the lowest unfilled n value, as shown in the image below. 1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 6 3 s 2 3 p 6 4 s 2 3 d 10 4 p 5 + e - → 1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 6 3 s 2 3 p 6 4 s 2 3 d 10 4 p 6 Therefore, the answer is Option C.

      "concept_text": "The reaction quotient is proportional to the number of products and reactants as shown below: Where, Q c = ratio of products to reactants at an instantaneous point in time, K c = ratio of products to reactants when equilibrium is reached Here is some key information you should know for the Canadian DAT: Going back to the question, the question says the pressure at equilibrium is higher than the initial pressure. The only way for pressure to increase is if the reaction went backwards (making more moles of gas). If the question told us that we increased the pressure by external means (ex making volume smaller) at equilibrium then the reaction will shift to the right. These type of questions involve the Chatelier's Principle or Equilibrium Law. However, the question in this problem is NOT about the Chatelier's principle. It told us that they put X amount of the three gas into a chamber, then when they reacted the pressure of the container increased. If the pressure increased in the container at a constant volume, then the only way the pressure increased is if there are more moles of gas present than there were initially. By looking at the formula, the only way to make more moles gas is if the reaction went backwards. This also means that they initially added more moles of NH 3 than moles of H 2 and N 2 combined which means Q > K (more products initially). Therefore, the correct answer is Option B. Q c > K c ; backward reaction .",

      "concept_text": "A systematic error is an error that is not determined by chance, but it is introduced by an inaccuracy inherent in the system, leading to consistent inaccuracies in data collection. The error is systematic because all readings taken with the equipment will deviate from their normal value, and therefore skew the data towards one direction (above or below the true value and by the same extent each time). These errors often result from incorrectly calibrated instruments such as pH meters, thermometers and balances. For example, a thermometer reading 3°C higher than the true temperature will result in data that is consistently 3°C higher. Based on this, Option C. Systematic Error is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Gross error – This option is incorrect because these errors are caused by experimenter carelessness or equipment failure. These \"outliers\" are so far above or below the true value that they are usually discarded when assessing data. Option B. Random error – This option is incorrect because these errors are caused by uncontrollable fluctuations in variables that affect experimental results. Option D. Personal error – This option is incorrect because these errors occur due to a faulty procedure adopted by the person making measurements. Option E.
