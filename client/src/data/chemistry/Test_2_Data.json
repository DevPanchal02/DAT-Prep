      "concept_text": "Electron configuration is the distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule in atomic or molecular orbitals. The first three orbitals are the s , p and d orbitals which hold 2, 6, and 10 electrons respectively. When we try to solve this question, at first glance the electron configuration of copper appears to be: [Ar] 4 s 2 3 d 9 However, there are certain elements that have special exceptions, copper being one of them since it is a transition metal . Transition metals such as copper need an electron to fill their d- orbitals; they get this electron from the full s- orbital. This occurs because elements with either half or full sub-orbitals are more stable than if they were empty orbitals. Therefore, we take the original electron configuration of [Ar] 4 s 2 3 d 9 , and we remove one electron from the 4 s and add it to the 3d- orbital, to get: [Ar] 4 s 1 3 d 10 This effectively results in a partial occupancy of the s- orbital and a full d- orbital. The same rule can be applied to the 4th group which are the transition metals with 4 electrons in their d- orbitals.

For example, the neutralization of a strong acid with a weak base results in an acidic salt. In comparison, the neutralization of a weak acid with a strong base results in a basic salt. Based on this, Option B. NaCl is the only neutral salt since both cation and anion are derived from strong conjugates. Canadian DAT Pro Tip: Most group 1 and 2 metals form strong bases.

      "concept_text": "Ionization energy is the input of energy required to remove an electron. Ionization energy INCREASES as we go to the top and right of the periodic table, as shown in the image below. As a result, Helium has the highest ionization energy, while Francium has the lowest. This phenomenon can be explained using the net effective nuclear charge (Z eff ) and atomic size. Z eff is the attractive force of the positively charged nucleus felt by an electron in a specific shell. Z eff is dependent on the number of protons and the number of electrons between the nucleus and the electron in the given shell. The electrons in between cause electron shielding, which means that electrons on the lower shells reduce the nucleus’ attractive forces experienced by the valence electrons. As a result, the lower we go on the periodic table, the greater the number of lower electron shells that reduce the attractive forces holding the valence electrons, and so the easier it would be to remove an electron. However, as we go to the right of the periodic table, the number of electrons in the lower shells stays constant, but the number of protons increases and thus the positive charge increases. Thus, the Z eff increases across the table and so does the ionization energy. Furthermore, as we go up and to the right of the periodic table, the smaller the atomic radii will be. As a result, the outer electrons will be closer to the nuclei and will experience a greater attractive force. Thus, the smaller the atom, the more energy required to remove an electron from the outer shell. The opposite applies as we go down the periodic table where we increase in atomic size. Therefore, the answer is Option E. as Argon has the highest ionization energy since it has the smallest atomic size and the highest Z eff .

      "concept_text": "Electroplating is the process of plating one metal with another metal using an electrolytic cell . The piece of metal which is being plated is made into the cathode because reduction always occurs at the cathode. The electrolyte contains positive cations of the metal that is being used to plate, which are reduced at the cathode. The anode thus contains a block of metal that is being used to plate. As electrons are transferred from the anode to the cathode, the positive Zn2+ ions are attracted to the negative cathode and reduction occurs , producing Zn that deposits on the copper metal. The reduced cations are then replaced by the anode. The electrolytic cell image below depicts the process of electroplating as a piece of metal is electroplated with copper. In this question, the piece of metal to be electroplated is a piece of copper metal (labeled ‘Me’ in the image below) and the anode consists of a sacrificial piece of zinc instead of the copper that is depicted below. Based on this, we can see that the following reactions are occurring: CC By 4.0 In comparison, a Galvanic cell generally consists of two different metals immersed in an electrolyte. Sometimes it can include individual half-cells with different metals and their ions in solution connected by a salt bridge. Oxidation occurs at the anode in both galvanic and electrolytic cells, which means that electrons flow from the anode to the cathode . The image below compares the features of a Galvanic cell and an Electrolytic cell. It can be seen that in both, reduction always takes place at the cathode and electrons always flow from the anode to cathode. The difference that can be seen in the picture is that in a Galvanic cell, the anode is negative while the cathode is positive, this is reversed in an electrolytic cell. Keep in mind that electroplating is a modified form of the electrolytic cell. CC By 4.0",

      "concept_text": "Nuclear binding energy is the energy required to disassemble the nucleus of an atom into its separate nucleons (protons and neutrons). The greater the binding energy, the more stable the nucleus is and the less likely it is to decay by losing a proton or neutron. The equation to calculate nuclear binding energy is: E = mc 2 Where E is the nuclear binding energy, m is the mass defect, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Mass defect is the difference in the mass of the nuclei and the total mass of its constituent nucleons. For example, the mass of helium on the periodic table is 4.00 amu. However, the mass of 2 protons + 2 neutrons is 4.03 amu; therefore, there is a mass defect of 0.03 amu. Based on the equation, nuclear binding energy is proportional to the mass defect ; the greater the mass defect, the greater the nuclear binding energy. Nuclear binding energy has no relation to intermolecular nor intramolecular forces, nor electron affinity.",

According to the kinetic molecular theory of gases , pressure results from the number of collisions that gas particles make with the walls of a container.  Decreasing volume while maintaining the same temperature and the same number of gas particles, increases the number of collisions with the walls of the container and increases the pressure.  Consequently, pressure and volume are inversely proportional, and every gas has a particular pressure-volume constant at a given temperature. Boyle's law describes this inverse relationship between volume (V) and pressure (P) for a fixed number of molecules of an ideal gas at constant temperature, where k is a constant: P∝1/V PV = k",

Upon first glance, this question may look like an organic chemistry question that involves an analytical understanding of mass spectrometry, but in actuality, it tests your understanding of isotopic mass. Essentially, the question can be rephrased as: \"What are the various isotopic combinations of atomic mass that could display as distinctive peaks on the mass spectrum?\". This type of question has shown up on the Canadian DAT recently under the chemistry section, so it is important to understand how to solve it. Given in the question, 1 H has an atomic mass of 1, 2 H has an atomic mass of 2, 79 Br has an atomic mass of 79, and lastly, 81 Br has an atomic mass of 81. The 4 combinations of these isotopes yield: 1 + 79 = 80 2 + 79 = 81 1 + 81 = 82 2 + 81 = 83 These numbers all correspond to the peaks shown in Option A. Therefore, the answer is Peaks for mass: 80 ( 1 H and 79 Br), 81 ( 2 H and 79 Br), 82 ( 1 H and 81 Br), and 83 ( 2 H and 81 Br) .",

      "concept_text": "Boiling-point elevation describes the phenomenon where the boiling point of a liquid will be higher when another compound is added. Specifically, this happens whenever a non-volatile solute , such as a salt, is added to a pure solvent, such as water. Therefore, a solution will have a higher boiling point than a pure solvent. In fact, boiling point is a colligative property, meaning it will only be affected by the effective concentration of solutes, regardless of the type of solute present. We obtain boiling point elevation by the change in \"iKm\" equation , as shown below: ΔT b = iK b m Where ΔT b = change of temperature, i= the van’t Hoff constant (i.e # of ions per molecule formed after dissolving), K b = boiling point elevation constant, and m = molality of solution (mol solute/Kg of solvent) Going back to the question, all of the given solutes have the same molality and are all assumed to dissolve in the same solvent. Therefore, the only factor that can elevate the boiling point is the van ’t Hoff constant . It is very important to know this for the Canadian DAT! Since the solute with the highest van ’t Hoff constant has the highest boiling point, Option A. 0.10 m K 2 SO 4 is the correct answer (it has a van ’t Hoff constant of 3 since it is a salt which dissociates into two K and one SO 4 ).",

      "concept_text": "In a redox reaction , oxidation and reduction always occur together.  An atom is reduced by gaining one or more electrons, but only if another atom loses the electrons. In order to track the gain or loss of electrons by atoms in reactions, an oxidation number is assessed for each atom in a compound relative to the number of electrons in a neutral atom of that element. To solve this question, we would have to calculate the oxidation number of chlorine in each compound given. As an example, we will calculate the oxidation number of chlorine for Option B. HClO 2 as an example. We know the oxidation of the entire compound is = 0. Next, we need to calculate the oxidation number for oxygen, hydrogen, chlorine. For oxygen, recall that the valency of oxygen is -2, we therefore multiply it by 2 since there are 2 oxygen atoms. For hydrogen, it would be +1. And lastly, for chlorine, we must isolate for it: (H × 1) + (Cl × 1) + (O × 2) = Oxidation # of compound (+1 × 1) + (Cl × 1) + (-2 × 2) = 0 (+1) + (Cl) + (-4) = 0 Cl = +3 Therefore, the answer is Option B.
