      "concept_text": "In most circumstances, the melting/freezing curve between the solid and liquid phases is positively sloped to reflect the fact that the solid phase is denser than the liquid phase. However, for water, the curve is negatively sloped because the liquid phase is denser than the solid phase. This is caused by the crystal lattice structure of the solid phase, causing the water molecules to be positioned further apart from each other than in the liquid phase, where hydrogen bonding causes water molecules to be more tightly packed. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B .",

Both solid and liquid phases are equally dense - If this were true, then the line would be completely vertical. Therefore, this choice is incorrect . Option D. The solid phase melts at below room temperature - Although this is true at a pressure range between 0.006 atm and 218 atm, it does not explain why the solid-liquid line is negatively sloped. For instance, the line could be positively sloped at a temperature range between 273 K and 273.2 K. Therefore, this choice is incorrect . Option E. The solid phase sublimes at below room temperature - Although this is true at a pressure range between 0 atm and 0.006 atm, it does not explain why the solid-liquid line is negatively sloped. Sublimation does not involve the liquid phase, but the gas phase instead. Therefore, this choice is incorrect .",

The atmospheric pressure is defined as the pressure exerted by the weight of air in the atmosphere. The vapor pressure is inversely correlated with the strength of intermolecular forces .

According to Beer’s law, all three variables are directly proportional to the absorbance of the material.

As one can see, the rate constant will vary depending on the concentration of products and reactants at equilibrium. When compared to another value, the reaction quotient, the equilibrium constant gains utility. The reaction quotient can be computed at any phase of the reaction and is computed as follows. When the rate quotient is equal to the equilibrium constant, the reaction has achieved equilibrium. However, when the rate constant is greater than the equilibrium constant that must mean that the concentrations of the product are in excess causing a greater reaction constant value. Thus, the reaction must proceed in such a direction to favor forming more reactants. On the other hand, if the reaction quotient is less than the equilibrium constant, it means that the concentration of reactants is in excess and the reaction will form more products.",

      "concept_text": "Filtration is a method of separation used to separate solids from liquids. There are a plethora of variations to this technique (e.g. vacuum filtration, centrifugal filtration, and gravity filtration), but the premise is largely similar in that some porous layer (filter) allows liquid to pass through but the holes are too small to allow the passage of any solids. This allows the liquid and solid phases to be collected separately in a lab setting. The image below illustrates simple filtration, in which oversize particles in the feed cannot pass through the filter, thus separating solid and liquid: CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Chromatography - This option is incorrect because it is commonly used to separate liquids of different polarities. In this technique, different liquids (mobile phases) move at different rates through a solid phase based on how much they are attracted to it. Liquids that are attracted least to the solid phase will move fastest through as they will not be as intensely drawn to it. Option B. Distillation - This option is incorrect because this technique separates different liquids based on their boiling points. If multiple liquids are heated, the ones with the lowest boiling point will evaporate quickest, and the vapors are subsequently captured, condensed, and carried into a separate chamber. Option C. Extraction - This option is incorrect because in this method, a separatory funnel is shaken and allows for immiscible liquids (e.g. polar and nonpolar) to be separated into distinct layers. After settling, the densest liquids will move to the bottom where they may be slowly released through a stopcock in order to separate each layer. Option E. Centrifuge - This option is incorrect because centrifuges spin incredibly fast which allows for the densest elements in a mixture to move to the bottom of a vessel. Therefore, if two liquids have different densities, they may be separated into layers by a centrifuge.",

      "concept_text": "Option C. Adding water to the concentrated acid is not a safe lab practice because when water is added to acid, an extremely exothermic reaction occurs that may result in spewing, splattering, and boiling acid. This process can lead to harmful splashing of acid on the skin or in the eyes. Therefore, acid should be added to the water as this leads to a dilute concentration of the new solution. A common rhyme to remember is: “Do what you oughta, add the acid to the water!”",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Weighing calcium outside the fume hood - This option is incorrect because calcium is a non-toxic metal that is solid at room temperature. As a result of its high boiling point, it has a low volatility and does not need to be massed in a fume hood as it will not easily be inhaled. Option B. Washing an Erlenmeyer flask in the sink - This option is incorrect because simple glassware is able to be washed in a sink, although any substances within the glassware must be appropriately cleaned before pouring contents down the drain. Option D. Lubricating glass joints of a vacuum filtration setup - This option is incorrect because without lubrication, vacuums create a seal between glassware that is tight enough to break the glassware when pulling it apart. Lubrication also helps prevent leaks in the experiment. Option E. Pouring sodium bicarbonate on an acid spill - This option is incorrect because the addition of this base helps neutralize the acid before cleaning. This prevents strong acids from being disposed of improperly and protects the skin of the person cleaning as well.",

      "concept_text": "This question requires knowledge of the concept of nuclear binding energy , which is the energy input required to separate the individual nucleons within the nucleus. Einstein’s equation, E = mC 2 indicates that energy (E) can be converted into mass (m). Therefore, when energy is inputted into the nucleus to cause separation of the nucleons, some of the energy is converted into mass which leads to a higher individual mass for free protons and neutrons. Conversely, this mass is lost again to create the energy needed to reform these bonds when nucleons come back together. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B .",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Mass increases when force of attraction decreases - This option is incorrect because mass does not depend on force. Mass is simply the amount of matter in an object, and this value does not change if the object is being pulled in any given direction. Option C. The mass held within bonds is transferred into the nucleons - This option is incorrect because bonds themselves never have mass. Bonds are simply forces of attraction, and mass increase instead comes from the energy input needed to separate nucleons. Option D. Gamma rays released from the split are absorbed by the nucleons - This option is incorrect because gamma rays are strictly energy and therefore, they do not increase the mass of objects when absorbed. Option E. Gravity acts upon the larger volume of the separated nucleons - This option is incorrect because gravity only acts upon mass, regardless of volume.",
