      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving nuclear chemistry , we will first review the isotope notation: In this case, we are asked to identify the isotope notation for selenium-78. Since the “78” refers to the mass number, we know A = 78. In addition, selenium’s chemical symbol is Se, so we can identify that selenium has a proton number of Z = 34 using the periodic table provided in your exam. Therefore, its isotope notation is: Recall that isotopes of the same element will have the same number of protons but different number of neutrons. Although all six selenium isotopes have 34 protons, they differ in mass number. Therefore, the answer is E .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving nuclear chemistry , recall that the mass defect refers to a phenomenon in which the mass of a nucleus is less than the mass of its constituent protons and neutrons weighed separately. The mass defect occurs because a small amount of mass is converted into energy when the protons and neutrons are bound together into a nucleus. The energy equivalent to the mass defect is the nuclear binding energy , which is the energy released when the nucleons come together to form the nucleus (or alternatively, the energy required to break apart the nucleus into its constituent nucleons). Remember that the larger the mass defect, the greater the nuclear energy. Mass defect and nuclear binding energy are related by Albert Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence principle, expressed as his famous equation: E = Δmc 2 E = binding energy, Δm = mass defect, c = speed of light As we can see, the binding energy can be increased by an increase in mass defect . Since the speed of light is constant (3.00 × 10 8 m•s -1 ), it cannot be changed, Options C and D are not possible ways to increase binding energy. Therefore, the answer is B .",
