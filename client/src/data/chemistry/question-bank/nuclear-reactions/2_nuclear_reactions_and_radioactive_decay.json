STEP 2: The mass number is 14 on both sides of the equation, so the mass is already conserved, and the mass number of X is 0. The atomic number is 6 on the left and 7 on the right side of the equation, which means that the atomic number of X must be -1 to balance the equation: As we can see, the correct identity of X is a beta particle (electron) species, which implies that the decay that occurred is a beta minus decay .

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving nuclear reactions , we will first review the types of radioactive decays that occur when the nucleus of an unstable atom spontaneously decays: STEP 1: To determine the resulting daughter nucleus after 35 Cl undergoes positron emission, we write the following equation: X represents the resulting daughter nucleus after 35 Cl undergoes positron emission. STEP 2: The mass number is 35 on the left and currently 0 on the right. This means that X must have a mass number of 35 in order for the equation to be balanced. In addition, the atomic number is 17 on the left and 1 on the right, so X must have an atomic number of 16 in order for the equation to be balanced. X is an atom with an atomic number of 16, so it is a sulfur atom (S). It also has a mass number of 35, so its isotope notation is: As we can see, the resulting daughter nucleus is 35 S. Therefore, the answer is B .",

This means that element X has the following isotope notation: STEP 2: Next, we learn that the element undergoes 2 alpha decays, 1 beta-minus decay, and 1 gamma decay, which allows us to write the following equation: Note that gamma decay does not involve the change in atomic or mass numbers. STEP 3: The mass number is 140 on the left and currently 4 + 4 = 8 on the right, which means that X new must have a mass number of 140 – 8 = 132 for the equation to be balanced.

Just to double check, the atomic number is 92 on the left, and currently 53 + 39 = 92 on the right, so we do not need any protons in the product side for the equation.
