STEP 1: If the initial radioactive sample had an activity of 1,200 Bq, and its activity drops to 37.5 Bq, we can see that 5 half-lives elapsed between the initial sample to the final sample: First half-life: 1,200 Bq à 600 Bq Second half-life: 600 Bq à 300 Bq Third half-life: 300 Bq à 150 Bq Fourth half-life: 150 Bq à 75 Bq Fifth half-life: 75 Bq à 37.5 Bq STEP 2: Since we know that five half-lives elapsed, and the question tells us that 15 days have passed, we can calculate the length of one half-life: 15 days ÷ 5 = 3 days As we can see, a radioactive sample with an initial activity of 1,200 Bq that drops to 37.5 Bq after 15 days has a half-life of 3 days .

The half-life is a characteristic property for each radioactive isotope and is independent of the quantity of the substance present. STEP 1: To solve this problem, we must use the given formula for radioactive decay, which is given to us in the question: A(t) = A 0 e -kt A( t ) = final quantity, A 0 = initial quantity, k = decay constant, t = time STEP 2: Next, we need to plug in the given quantities into the formula. However, because we must give our answer in disintegrations per minute, we must convert the given initial activity (6,000 disintegrations per hour) and decay constant (0.6 hour -1 ) to their equivalent quantity in minutes: 6,000 disintegrations per hour ÷ 60 = 100 disintegrations per minute 0.6 hour -1 ÷ 60 = 0.01 min -1 STEP 3: Now, we can plug in the given quantities above into the formula, where the initial quantity is A 0 = 100 disintegrations per minute, the decay constant is k = 0.01 min -1 , and the activity lasts for t = 30 minutes: A(t) = 100e -(0.01)(30) Therefore, the answer is E .",
