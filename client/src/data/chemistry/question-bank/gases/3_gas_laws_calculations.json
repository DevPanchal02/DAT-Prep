      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving gases , let’s review the gas laws: In this question, we are given the initial temperature, pressure, and volume, as well as the final temperature. Since we are told that temperature is the only factor that is changing, we must look for a gas law that relates temperature to either pressure or volume. Gay-Lussac's law tells us that temperature and pressure are directly related, meaning that a decrease in temperature would lead to a decrease in pressure. Plugging in our variables, we get: Charles's law tells us that temperature and volume are directly related, meaning a decrease in temperature would lead to a decrease in volume. Plugging in our variables, we get: Therefore, the answer is C . Option A. Decreasing the number of moles to 2 moles Incorrect. The Combined Gas Law states that the number of moles and temperature are indirectly related. If the number of moles decreased from 4 moles to 2 moles, the temperature would increase to 600 K. Option B. Increasing the pressure to 54 atm Incorrect. Gay-Lussac’s law states that temperature and pressure are directly related. If the pressure was increased from 18 atm to 54 atm, the temperature would increase to 900 K. Option C. Decreasing the volume to 5 L Correct. Charles’s law states that volume and temperature are directly related. Therefore, to decrease the temperature from 300 K to 100 K, we can decrease the volume from 15 L to 5 L. Option D. Increasing the volume to 45 L Incorrect. Charles’s law states that volume and temperature are directly related. If the volume was increased from 15 L to 45 L, the temperature would increase to 900 K. Option E. Decreasing the pressure to 3 atm Incorrect. Gay-Lussac’s law states that temperature and pressure are directly related. If the pressure was decreased from 18 atm to 3 atm, the temperature would decrease to 50 K. Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving gases , let’s review the gas laws: Option A. Decrease the volume to 2.5 L and decrease the temperature to 75 K Incorrect. Decreasing the volume from 5 L to 2.5 L increases the pressure by a factor of 2 (Boyle’s Law) and decreasing the temperature from 150 K to 75 K decreases the pressure by a factor of 2 (Gay Lussac's Law). As a result, there is no change in pressure (1 atm). Option B. Increase the volume to 10 L and increase the temperature to 300 K Incorrect. Increasing the volume from 5 L to 10 L decreases the pressure by a factor of 2 (Boyle’s Law) and increasing the temperature from 150 K to 300 K increases the pressure by a factor of 2 (Gay Lussac's Law). As a result, there is no change in pressure (1 atm). Option C. Decrease the volume to 2.5 L and increase the temperature to 300 K Correct. Decreasing the volume from 5 L to 2.5 L increases the pressure by a factor of 2 (Boyle’s Law) and increasing the temperature from 150 K to 300 K increases the pressure by a factor of 2 (Gay Lussac's Law). As a result, pressure increases by a factor of 4 (4 atm). Option D. Decrease the volume to 2.5 L with no change in temperature Incorrect. Decreasing the volume from 5 L to 2.5 L increases the pressure by a factor of 2 (Boyle’s Law). As a result, pressure increases by a factor of 2 (2 atm). Option E. Increase the volume to 20 L and decrease the temperature to 75 K Incorrect. Increasing the volume from 5 L to 20 L decreases the pressure by a factor of 4 (Boyle’s Law) and decreasing the temperature from 150 K to 75 K decreases the pressure by a factor of 2 (Gay Lussac's Law). As a result, pressure decreases by a factor of 8 (0.125 atm). Therefore, the answer is C .",
