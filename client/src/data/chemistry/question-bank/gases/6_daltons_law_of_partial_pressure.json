      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving partial pressure , we need to know the partial pressure formulas involving mole fractions. STEP 1: First, we will calculate for the moles of 22 g of CO 2 using the mass-mole formula. We know that the molar mass of CO 2 is 44.01 g·mol -1 . STEP 2: Next, we will calculate for the moles of 60 g of NO using the mass-mole formula. We know that the molar mass of NO is 30.01 g·mol -1 . STEP 3: Next, we will calculate the mole fraction of CO 2 with the mole fraction formula, using the moles calculated in Step 1 and 2. STEP 4: Finally, we will calculate the partial pressure of CO 2 with the partial pressure formula, using the mole fraction calculated in Step 3 and the total pressure of 5 atm.
