Gases cannot be easily compressed Incorrect. Due to the gas particles being spread out, they are relatively more easily compressed compared to solids and liquids. Option D. Gases take shape of their container Correct. Gases take the shape of their container because gases themselves do not have a definitive shape. Option E. Gases have the same pressure at all temperatures Incorrect. At constant volume, pressure has a direct relationship with temperature. As pressure increases, temperature increases, and vice versa.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving general properties of gases , letâ€™s first review what happens when the volume of gas is increased under constant temperature. When the volume of a container is increased, the amount of space between the molecules is increased and therefore the molecules collide with the container less often. Since pressure is dependent on the number of collisions of molecules with the container, pressure would decrease as a result of the molecules colliding with the container less often. Option A. The molecules move faster in the container Incorrect. Since the temperature remains constant, the velocity and kinetic energy of the molecules does not change. Option B. The molecules collide with the container more often Incorrect. Molecules collide with each other and the container more often if there is less space between them, which would occur if the volume of the container was decreased . Option C. The molecules move slower in the container Incorrect. Since the temperature remains constant, the velocity and kinetic energy of the molecules does not change. Option D. The molecules collide with the container less often Correct. When the volume of a container is increased, the gas particles are more spread out and collide with each other and the container less often. Option E. The number of molecules increases Incorrect.

Increasing kinetic energy will lead to an increase in the speed of molecules, because kinetic energy is proportional to the speed of molecules. Option D. Increase in density Incorrect. Increasing kinetic energy will lead to a decrease in density, because an increase in kinetic energy (and temperature) usually leads to the molecules gaining more energy to move around, which increases volume and decreases density. An analogy would be to think of what happens when we heat a piece of metal â€“ its volume increases, which decreases density. Option E. Increase in pressure Correct. Increasing kinetic energy will lead to an increase in the speed of molecules, which results in an increase in the number of collisions, ultimately leading to an increase in pressure.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving general properties of gases, we need to know the pressure formula: STEP 1: First, we will need to calculate for pressure when 3 N of force is applied on a 6 cm 2 platform. STEP 2: Next, we will solve for the force needed to maintain the same pressure on a 9 cm 2 platform using the pressure calculated in Step 1. We can use a rearranged form of the pressure formula to solve for force. Therefore, the answer is B .",
