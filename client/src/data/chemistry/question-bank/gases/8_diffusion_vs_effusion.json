Option C. effusion occurs from high to low concentration of a gas while diffusion does not. Incorrect. Both effusion and diffusion occur from high to low concentrations. Option D. effusion requires a semipermeable membrane while diffusion does not. Incorrect. Both effusion and diffusion do not require a semipermeable membrane. However, diffusion can occur through a semipermeable membrane. Option E. effusion requires a small hole in a confined space while diffusion does not. Correct. Effusion specifically requires confined gas to escape through a small hole, while diffusion can occur across any space that allows the free and natural movement of gas particles.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving diffusion , we need to know that diffusion describes the spontaneous movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to lower concentration. Option A. Separation of oil and vinegar Incorrect. The separation of oil and vinegar is a result of immiscibility since oil is composed of nonpolar molecules while vinegar primarily contains polar molecules. Option B. A spray of perfume dispersing in a room Correct. The dispersion of perfume throughout a room occurs due to diffusion. This is because when you initially spray the perfume, the region near the source contains a higher concentration of perfume molecules. As the rest of the room contains a lower concentration of these molecules, the perfume gradually spreads through the room, moving from areas of high concentration to those with lower concentrations. Option C. Gas moving from low to high concentration Incorrect. A gas moving from low to high concentration opposes the direction of diffusion, which involves the movement of particles from high to low concentrations. Option D. Sea breeze during a sunny day Incorrect. A sea breeze after the sunset is the result of a temperature and pressure gradient. Air on land heats up faster than air above seawater, which results in lower air pressure over the land and causes higher pressure air from the sea to flow toward the land. Option E. Water flowing downhill in a river Incorrect. Water flowing downhill in a river is a result of gravity, which is not a factor for diffusion. Therefore, the answer is B .",

On average for the same substance, gases are at higher temperatures than liquids, which correlates to gases having higher kinetic energy than liquids. Option C. Gas particles have higher densities than liquids Incorrect. Gas particles typically have lower densities than liquids. At the same volume, most gases will have less mass than liquids. Option D. Gas particles are more spread apart than liquids Correct. Gas particles are typically more spread apart than liquids which gives gas particles greater freedom of motion and a higher susceptibility of effusing out of a small hole. Option E. Gas particles have heavier molar masses than liquids Incorrect. Gas particles do not always have heavier molar masses than liquids. In fact, effusion rate tends to also decrease as molar mass increases. Therefore, the answer is D .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving effusion , we will need to know the formula for Graham’s Law of Effusion: STEP 1: First, we will let rate 1 be the rate of effusion of gas A and let rate 2 be the rate of effusion of helium: STEP 2: Next, we will plug in the molar mass of helium (4 g•mol -1 ). Since the rate of effusion of gas A is 0.2 times the rate of effusion of helium we can also plug in 0.2 for the ratio of the rates between gas A and helium. STEP 3: Finally, we square both sides of the formula, and re-arrange it to solve for the molar mass of gas A. Therefore, the answer is D .",

Notice the molar masses of X and Y switched places in the fraction during this process. STEP 3: Next, we will represent the molar mass of gas Y as 4 times the molar mass of gas X . STEP 4: Finally, we will plug in the rate of effusion of gas X (2.0 m•s -1 ) and the molar mass of gas Y in terms of molar mass of gas X as represented in Step 3, to calculate for the rate of effusion of gas Y .
