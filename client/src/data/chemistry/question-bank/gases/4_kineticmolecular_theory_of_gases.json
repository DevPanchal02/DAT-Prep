      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving Kinetic-Molecular Theory of Gases , we will need to know the 5 th postulate of the theory which states – all gases have the same average kinetic energy that is directly proportional to the temperature in Kelvins. As the gas container is at constant volume, the pressure of the gas is directly proportional to the temperature and therefore the twofold increase in pressure can be achieved by doubling the temperature. Furthermore, the doubling of the temperature results in the doubling of the average kinetic energy of gas particles, as they are proportional. In this case, to achieve a twofold increase in the pressure, the kinetic energy would increase by a factor of 2 . Therefore, the answer is C .",
