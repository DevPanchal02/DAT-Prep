The gas density formula is: According to the gas density formula: Option A. Gas constant decreases Incorrect. The gas constant R is a constant value and does not change with altitude. Option B. Atmospheric pressure decreases Correct. As altitude increases in Earth’s atmosphere, atmospheric pressure P decreases. This causes gas particles to spread apart, resulting in fewer particles per unit volume and a decrease in gas density. Option C. Molar mass of gases increases Incorrect. When molar mass of gases increases, the mass of the gas particles per mole increases, which results in the density of the gas to increase. Option D. Number of particles increases Incorrect. When the number of particles increases per unit volume, the mass of the gas increases, which results in the density of the gas to increase . Option E. Temperature decreases Incorrect. When the temperature decreases, gas particles decrease in speed and move closer together. This leads to a decrease in volume which results in the density of the gas to increase . Although temperature does decrease at higher altitudes, it is not a factor that would lead to the overall decrease in density. Therefore, the answer is B .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving gas density , we will need to know the gas density formula: P = pressure, M = molar mass, R = ideal gas constant, T = temperature STEP 1: First, we will convert 17°C to Kelvins. STEP 2: Next, we will rearrange the variables of the gas density formula to solve for molar mass: STEP 3: Next, we will plug in our given values, such as the pressure ( P = 8.21 atm), density ( ρ = 5 g•L -1 ), gas constant ( R = 0.0821) and temperature ( T = 290 K), to solve for molar mass. STEP 4: Finally, we will solve for mass by multiplying the molar mass found in Step 3 with the given 8 moles. Therefore, the answer is C .",
