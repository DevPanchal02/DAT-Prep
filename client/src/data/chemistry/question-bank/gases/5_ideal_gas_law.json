      "concept_text": "Keep in mind that we need to identify the statement that is false regarding the ideal gas law. Option A. Pressure and volume are inversely proportional. Incorrect. This is a derived relationship from the ideal gas law, also known as Boyle’s Law. Option B. Volume and temperature are directly proportional. Incorrect. This is a derived relationship from the ideal gas law, also known as Charles Law. Option C. Pressure and temperature are directly proportional. Incorrect. This is a derived relationship from the ideal gas law, also found within the combined gas law. Option D. Volume and the number of moles is directly proportional. Incorrect. This is a derived relationship from the ideal gas law, also known as Avogadro’s Law. Option E. The number of moles and pressure are inversely proportional. Correct. This is NOT a derived relationship from the ideal gas law. In fact, the number of moles and pressure would be directly proportional , because increasing the number of moles in a container increases the number of collisions, which increases pressure. Therefore, the answer is E .",

STEP 1: First, we can rearrange the ideal gas law equation to solve for the temperature: STEP 2: Next, we must use the molar mass of CO 2 to convert from mass (g) to moles (mol), this will give us our “n” value: STEP 3: Then, we can plug in our given values into the ideal gas law equation – pressure (P = 1 atm), volume ( V = 12 L), number of moles ( n = 0.25 mol), and our gas constant ( R = 0.0821): STEP 4: Keep in mind that the temperature we have solved for is in Kelvins and we must convert to degrees Celsius: Therefore, the answer is A .",
