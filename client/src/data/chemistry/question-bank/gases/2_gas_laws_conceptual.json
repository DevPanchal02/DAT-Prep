The question asks us to relate the temperature and pressure of a gas at a constant volume, which means that we will be using Gay-Lussac’s Law. STEP 2: Next, we know that the temperature of the gas is doubled, so we can write: STEP 3: Next, we can plug this into our original equation: STEP 4: Finally, we can solve for the value of P2 by multiplying both sides by 2T1: Since P2 = 2P1, the pressure increases by a factor of 2 . Therefore, the answer is D . Note : This question can also be solved conceptually using Gay-Lussac’s Law. Gay-Lussac’s Law states that the temperature and pressure of a gas are directly related, and so if the temperature was doubled, the pressure must double as well.",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving gases , let’s review the gas laws: STEP 1 : First, we identify the gas law needed to solve this problem. The question asks us to relate the pressure and volume of a gas at a constant temperature, which means that we will be using Boyle’s Law. STEP 2 : Next, we know that the pressure of the gas is tripled, so we can write: STEP 3 : Next, we can plug this into our original equation: STEP 4 : Finally, we can solve for the value of V2 by dividing both sides by 3P1: Since V2 = 1/3 × V1, the volume decreases by a factor of 3. Therefore, the answer is A . Note : This question can also be solved conceptually, using Boyle’s Law. Boyle’s Law states that the volume and pressure of a gas are indirectly related, and so if the final pressure is triple the initial pressure, the final volume must be a third of the initial volume.",
