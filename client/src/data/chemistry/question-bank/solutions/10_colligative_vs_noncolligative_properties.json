For this question, we need to find a pair that share the same number or concentration of particles, but do not share the same chemical compounds. Option A. 3.0 M NaCl solution; 6.0 M glucose solution Correct. 3.0 M NaCl solution has 3.0 × 2 = 6.0 M of particles because NaCl dissociates into 1 Na + ion and 1 Cl - ion. 6.0 M glucose solution has 6.0 × 1 = 6.0 M of particles because glucose does not dissociate and stays as 1 molecule. Since both solutions have the same concentration of particles, they share the same colligative properties, but different non-colligative properties. Option B. 1.0 M glucose solution; 1.0 M H 2 SO 4 solution Incorrect. 1.0 M glucose solution has 1.0 × 1 = 1.0 M of particles because glucose does not dissociate. 1.0 M H 2 SO 4 solution has 1.0 × 3 = 3.0 M of particles because H 2 SO 4 dissociates into 2 H + ions and 1 SO 4 2- ion.

Option C. 1.0 M H 2 SO 4 solution; 3.0 M HCl solution Incorrect. 1.0 M H 2 SO 4 solution has 1.0 × 3 = 3.0 m of particles because H 2 SO 4 dissociates into 2 H + ions and 1 SO 4 2- ion. 3.0 M HCl solution has 3.0 × 2 = 6.0 M of particles because HCl dissociates into 1 H + ion and 1 Cl - ion.

Option D. 0.5 M NaCl solution; 1.0 M H 2 SO 4 solution Incorrect. 0.5 M NaCl solution has 0.5 × 2 = 1.0 M of particles because NaCl dissociate into 1 Na + ion and 1 Cl - ion. 1.0 M H 2 SO 4 solution has 1.0 × 3 = 3.0 M of particles because H 2 SO 4 dissociates into 2 H + ion and 1 SO 4 2- ion.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving colligative properties , we need to know that colligative properties are properties that depend on the number or concentration of solute particles, but not upon the identity of the solute. The four main colligative properties are: Since a solution is changed from 2.0 M NaCl to 2.0 M HCl, the number of solute particles remains the same: Since the number of solute particles remain the same, the colligative properties stay the same. Therefore, the property that remains the same is osmotic pressure. The rest of the options are non-colligative properties. Therefore, the answer is B .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving colligative and non-colligative properties , we need to know the definitions of the properties. STEP 1: First, we need to calculate the concentration of particles in 3.0 M AgCl, keeping in mind that AgCl does not dissociate in water and stays as 1 molecule: STEP 2: Next, we need to calculate the concentration of particles for 2.0 K­ 2 CO 3 , keeping in mind that K 2 CO 3 dissociate into 2 K + ions and 1 CO 3 2- ion: The solutions do not share the same colligative properties because the solutions do not have the same concentration of solute particles. The solutions also do not share the same non-colligative properties because AgCl and K 2 CO 3 are made up of different ions. Therefore, 3.0 M AgCl and 2.0 M K 2 CO 3 have no property shared. Therefore, the answer is E .",
