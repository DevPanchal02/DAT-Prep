      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving mole fractions , we will need to determine the mass (g) of both HCl and H 2 O. Next, we can use the given molar masses to determine our moles of HCl and H 2 O. From here, we can determine the total number of moles in solution and subsequently our mole fractions. STEP 1: First we must establish the mass (g) of both HCl and H 2 O in a solution containing 37% HCl by weight. Let’s assume we have a solution with a total mass of 100 g. If the solution contains 37% of HCl by weight, the amount of HCl in grams will equal 37 g. As the total mass of solution is equal to 100 g, then by subtracting the amount of HCl by the total amount (100 g – 37 g), we can determine the amount of H 2 O in grams will equal 63 g. STEP 2: Now that we have our mass (g) for both HCl and H 2 O, we can convert from mass (g) to moles (mol) using their respective molar masses: STEP 3: Next, we can determine the total number of moles in solution by adding the moles of HCl and H 2 O: STEP 4: Lastly, we can input our moles of HCl (1 mol) and H 2 O (3.5 mol), with our total moles of solution (4.5 mol) into our mole fraction formula: Therefore, the answer is D .",
