Blood can also be physically separated – think about a centrifuge that separates the cells from the plasma! Option A (wine), option B (steel), option D (vinegar) and option E (rain) are classified as homogeneous mixtures, since they have a uniform composition, cannot be physically separated using simple techniques, and the individual components are not visually distinguished.

Alloys have a uniform composition and the constituent parts that make up an alloy are physically mixed (not chemically). In addition, its constituent components are visually indistinguishable, and cannot be separated using simple physical techniques. Option B. NH 3 Correct. NH 3 is a compound . NH3is formed using two or more different types of elements (i.e., N and H) chemically combined in fixed proportions. NH 3 can be chemically broken down and is represented by a chemical formula (NH 3 ). Option C. Pure air Incorrect. Pure air is a homogeneous mixture . Pure air has a uniform composition, its constituent components are visually indistinguishable and cannot be separated using simple physical techniques. Option D. Silicon Incorrect. Silicon is an element . Silicon has the chemical symbol Si and an atomic number of 14. All silicon atoms have 14 protons in their nucleus. Option E. A salad Incorrect.

Mixtures are further classified into two categories: A simple way to predict whether a compound will dissolve is “like dissolves like”. “Like dissolves like” means that the stronger (and more similar) the intermolecular forces between the solute and solvent, the greater the solubility of the solute in the solvent. In order words, a polar solvent will dissolve a polar solute, while a non-polar solvent will dissolve a non-polar solute. Keep in mind that we need to find the option that is n ot going to form the suggested mixture . Option A. Benzene (C 6 H 6 ) will form a heterogeneous mixture with water (H 2 O) Incorrect. Benzene is a non-polar solute and water is a polar solvent. Since a non-polar solute cannot dissolve in a polar solvent, a heterogeneous mixture is formed. Option B. Glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) will form a homogeneous mixture with water (H 2 O) Incorrect. Glucose is a polar solute and water is a polar solvent. Since a polar solute dissolves in a polar solvent, a homogeneous mixture is formed. Option C. Benzene (C 6 H 6 ) will form a homogeneous mixture with toluene (C 6 H 5 CH 3 ) Incorrect. Benzene is a non-polar solute and toluene is a non-polar solvent. Since a non-polar solute dissolves in a non-polar solvent, a homogeneous mixture is formed. Option D. Borane (BH 3 ) will form a homogeneous mixture with toluene (C 6 H 5 CH 3 ). Incorrect. Borane is a non-polar solute and toluene is a non-polar solvent. Since a non-polar solute dissolves in a non-polar solvent, a homogeneous mixture is formed. Option E. Acetone (C 3 H 6 O) will form a heterogeneous mixture with water (H 2 O) Correct. Acetone is a polar solute and water is a polar solvent. Since a polar solute does dissolve in a polar solvent, a homogeneous mixture is formed. Therefore, the answer is E .",
