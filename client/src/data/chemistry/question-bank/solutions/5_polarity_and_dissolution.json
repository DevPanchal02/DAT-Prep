In order words, a polar solvent will dissolve a polar solute, while a non-polar solvent will dissolve a non-polar solute. In this case, we can recall that water’s molecular structure consists of two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to an oxygen atom.  Because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, oxygen attracts the electrons more tightly and gains a partial negative charge, while hydrogen gains a partial positive charge. As a result, water molecules form extensive hydrogen bonds – in fact, every water molecule can hydrogen bond with up to three other water molecules! Alcohol compounds have a polar hydroxyl (oxygen-hydrogen) group. As a result, alcohols tend to be highly soluble in water because the hydroxyl group in alcohol molecules forms hydrogen bonds with the water molecules. Therefore, the answer is A .",

In order words, a polar solvent will dissolve a polar solute, while a non-polar solvent will dissolve a non-polar solute. In this case, we begin by recognizing that water is a polar solvent.  Since water is a polar solvent, and “like dissolves like”, we predict that polar solutes will exhibit high solubility in water, while non-polar solutes exhibit low solubility. Looking at the option choices, we see that BH3 is the only non-polar molecule and, as a result, will exhibit low solubility in a polar solvent, such as water. Keep in mind that we need to find the molecule that does not dissolve in water. Option A. C 2 H 5 OH Incorrect. C 2 H 5 OH (ethanol) is an organic compound containing polar a hydroxyl (oxygen-hydrogen) group. Because the molecule has a dipole, the molecule is polar and will dissolve in water. Note that ethanol and water form strong hydrogen bonds, which increases solubility. Option B. C 3 H 6 O Incorrect. C 3 H 6 O (acetone) is an organic compound containing a polar carbonyl (carbon-oxygen) group. Because the molecule has a dipole, the molecule is polar and will dissolve in water.

Because the molecule is symmetrical and all the bonds are non-polar, the molecule is non-polar and does not dissolve in water. Option E. C 5 H 10 O 5 Incorrect. C 5 H 10 O 5 is an asymmetrical molecule consisting of multiple regions with dipoles. Because C 5 H 10 O 5 is asymmetrical and has multiple regions with dipoles, this molecule is polar and will dissolve in water. Therefore, the answer is D .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving dissolution , let’s recall that a simple way to predict whether a compound will dissolve is “like dissolves like”. “Like dissolves like” means that the stronger (and more similar) the intermolecular forces between the solute and solvent, the greater the solubility of the solute in the solvent. In order words, a polar solvent will dissolve a polar solute, while a non-polar solvent will dissolve a non-polar solute. In this case, we begin by recognizing that benzene (C 6 H 6 ) is a non-polar solute. Since benzene is a non-polar solute, and “like dissolves like”, we predict that benzene will exhibit high solubility in non-polar solvents and low solubility in polar solvents.  Looking at the option choices, we see that toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) is the only non-polar solvent and would be the best choice for dissolving a non-polar solute, such as benzene. Option A. Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) Correct. Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) is an aromatic hydrocarbon. Because C₆H₅CH 3 is comprised of only non-polar carbon-hydrogen bonds, toluene is non-polar and would dissolve a non-polar compound. Option B. Water (H 2 O) Incorrect. H 2 O (water) is an asymmetrical, bent molecule comprised of 2 polar hydrogen-oxygen bonds and, as a result, is capable of hydrogen bonding. Because H 2 O is asymmetrical and the dipoles do not cancel out, water is polar and would not dissolve a non-polar compound. Option C. Acetone (C 3 H 6 O) Incorrect. C 3 H 6 O (acetone) is an organic compound containing a polar carbonyl (carbon-oxygen) group. Because C 3 H 6 O has a dipole, acetone is polar and would not dissolve a non-polar compound. Option D. Methanol (CH 3 OH) Incorrect. CH 3 OH (methanol) is an organic compound containing a polar hydroxyl (oxygen-hydrogen) group and, as a result, is capable of hydrogen bonding. Because CH 3 OH has a dipole, methanol is polar and would not dissolve a non-polar compound. Option E. Isopropanol (C 3 H 8 O) Incorrect. C 3 H 8 O (isopropanol) is an organic compound containing a polar hydroxyl (oxygen-hydrogen) group and, as a result, is capable of hydrogen bonding. Because C 3 H 8 O has a dipole, isopropanol is polar and would not dissolve a non-polar compound. Therefore, the answer is A . Canadian DAT Pro Tip: Non-polar molecules do not have a permanent dipole and, as a result, they cannot form hydrogen bonds. If a molecule is capable of hydrogen bonding, this is a certain indication the molecule is polar.",

In other words, a polar solvent will dissolve a polar solute, while a non-polar solvent will dissolve a non-polar solute. In this case, we begin by recognizing that C 2 H 4, and CCl 4 are both non-polar solutes.  Since both solutes are non-polar, and “like dissolves like”, we can predict that the unknown compound is a non-polar solvent. Looking at the option choices, we see that CH 4 is the only non-polar solute and, as a result, will likely also dissolve in the unknown, non-polar solvent. Option A. SO 2 Incorrect. SO 2 is an asymmetrical, bent molecule comprised of 2 polar sulfur-oxygen bonds. Because SO 2 is asymmetrical and the dipoles do not cancel out, SO 2 is polar and will not dissolve in a non-polar compound. Option B. H 2 O Incorrect. H 2 O is an asymmetrical, bent molecule comprised of 2 polar hydrogen-oxygen bonds. Because H 2 O is asymmetrical and the dipoles do not cancel out, H 2 O is polar and would not dissolve a non-polar compound. Option C. C 12 H 22 O 11 Incorrect. C 12 H 22 O 11 is an asymmetrical molecule consisting of multiple regions with dipoles. Because C 12 H 22 O 11 is asymmetrical and has multiple regions with dipoles, C 12 H 22 O 11 is polar and would not dissolve in a non-polar compound. Option D. CO Incorrect. CO is a linear molecule comprised of a polar carbon-oxygen bond. Because CO has a dipole it is a polar molecule and will not dissolve in a non-polar compound. Option E. CH 4 Correct. CH 4 is a symmetrical, tetrahedral molecule comprised of 4 non-polar carbon-hydrogen bonds. Because CH 4 has no polar bonds, CH 4 is non-polar and will dissolve in a non-polar compound. Therefore, the answer is E .",
