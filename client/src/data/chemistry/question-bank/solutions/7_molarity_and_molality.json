      "concept_text": "Keep in mind that we need to identify the statement that is false regarding molality. Option A. The SI unit for molality is mol• kg -1 Incorrect. Mol·kg -1 is the correct unit for molality. Option B. Molality does not depend on the volume of the solvent Incorrect. Molality depends on the moles of solute and the kg of solvent, NOT the volume. Option C. Molality is an intensive property Incorrect. Intensive properties depend only on the type of matter and not the amount. Molality is an intensive property as it is unaffected by the quantity of the substance. To illustrate this point, if we were to compare a small sample and a large sample of the same solution, both would exhibit the same molality. Extensive properties, in contrast, change depending on the quantity of the substance. Option D. Molality does not change with pressure Incorrect. Molality is independent of pressure changes. Option E. Both molality and molarity change with temperature Correct. A change in temperature will ultimately increase or decrease the volume of the solvent (e.g., solution volume increases with temperature through expansion), thus changing the molarity. On the other hand, as temperature does not affect the mass (kg) of solvent, molality remains unaffected. Therefore, molality does NOT change with temperature while molarity does . Therefore, the answer is E .",

STEP 1: First, we must find the moles of HCl by using our respective mass and molar mass: STEP 2: Next, we must use the density formula to find the volume of the solution. We must use the combined mass of HCl and H 2 O, and the density of water: STEP 3: Lastly, we can plug in our moles of HCl (2 mol) and our volume of solution (0.8 L) into the molarity formula: Therefore, the answer is C .",

From there, we can determine the concentration of the Ba(OH) 2 solution by using the moles and volume of Ba(OH) 2 . STEP 1: First, we must write out the reactants and products, and then appropriately balance the reaction: STEP 2: Next, we can use our molarity formula to determine the amount of moles of HCl: STEP 3: Then, we can use our mole ratios to convert moles of HCl to moles of Ba(OH) 2 . Another way to think of this step is that because Ba(OH) 2 dissociates into two OH - ions, we need double the amount of H + from HCl to fully titrate the Ba(OH) 2 . STEP 4: Lastly, we can plug in the moles (0.025 mol) and volume (75 mL) of Ba(OH) 2 into our molarity formula to determine the molar concentration of Ba(OH) 2 : Therefore, the answer is C .",
