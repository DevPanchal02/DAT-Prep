Option B. is the major component of a solution. Incorrect. The solute is the minor component of a solution. Option C. may exist as a solid, liquid, or gas. Correct. Although solutes are commonly thought of as solids that dissolve in a liquid solvent, remember that solutes can also exist as a solid, liquid, or gas. Option D. always remains unchanged. Incorrect. Solutes are oftentimes changed in a solution – whether they dissociate, react, precipitate, or decompose. Option E. is always present in a larger quantity than the solvent. Incorrect. Solutes are present in a smaller quantity than the solvent in a solution. Therefore, the answer is C .",

So we know that K 2 CO 3 is soluble in water because of the predominance of its soluble components (K + ) over its insoluble components (CO 3 2- ). Option A. K 2 CO 3 Correct. K + is under the list of soluble salts. CO 3 2- is under the list of insoluble salts. Therefore, K 2 CO 3 is soluble in water because it has one component that is soluble. Option B. CuCO 3 Incorrect. Cu 2+ does not appear under soluble nor insoluble salts. CO 3 2- is under the list of insoluble salts. Therefore, CuCO 3 is insoluble in water. Option C. MnCO 3 Incorrect. Mn 2+ does not appear under soluble nor insoluble salts. CO 3 2- is under the list of insoluble salts. Therefore, MnCO 3 is insoluble in water. Option D. Ag 2 CO 3 Incorrect. Ag + is under the list of insoluble salts. CO 3 2- is under the list of insoluble salts. Therefore, AgCO 3 is insoluble in water. Option E. FeCO 3 Incorrect. Fe 2+ does not appear under soluble nor insoluble salts. CO 3 2- is under the list of insoluble salts. Therefore, FeCO 3 is insoluble in water. Therefore, the answer is A .",
