      "concept_text": "STEP 1: First, we write down the balanced molecular equation, remembering that these reactions are double displacement reactions: 2 AgNO 3( aq ) + CaCl 2 aq ) → 2 AgCl ( s ) + Ca(NO 3 ) 2( aq ) We know that Ag + is generally insoluble, so AgCl is insoluble and precipitates in solution. AgNO 3 , on the other hand, is soluble because NO 3 - is soluble. STEP 2: Next, we convert the molecular equation into its equivalent ionic equation, making sure to separate aqueous compounds into their component ions (and keeping solid compounds unchanged, since they are insoluble and do not dissociate): 2 Ag + ( aq ) + 2 NO 3 - ( aq ) + Ca 2+ ( aq ) + 2 Cl - ( aq ) → 2 AgCl ( s ) + Ca 2+ ( aq ) + 2 NO 3 - ( aq ) STEP 3: Next, we remove the spectator ions, which are the ions that appear both before and after the reaction: 2 Ag + ( aq ) + 2 NO 3 - ( aq ) + Ca 2+ ( aq ) + 2 Cl - ( aq ) → 2 AgCl ( s ) + Ca 2+ ( aq ) + 2 NO 3 - ( aq ) STEP 4: Finally, we are left with our net ionic equation: 2 Ag + ( aq ) + 2 Cl - ( aq ) → 2 AgCl ( s ) Therefore, the answer is B .",
