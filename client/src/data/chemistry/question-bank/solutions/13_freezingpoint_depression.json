The formula for freezing point depression is: As we can see, the extent of freezing point depression is proportional to the molal concentration of the solution. When we add a solute to a solvent, the molal concentration increases. An increase in the molal concentration leads to an increase in the extent of freezing point depression. Therefore, the primary factor responsible for the phenomenon of freezing point depression is the addition of a solute to a solvent. Therefore, the answer is B .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving freezing point depression , we will need to understand the formula of freezing point depression: Option A. Adding salt to the water Correct. Adding salt to the water not only increases the molal concentration of the solution, but because salts are composed of two or more ions that dissociate in water, the van’t Hoff factor will also be 2 or greater. This will result in the greatest freezing point depression, making it effective in preventing the fountain from freezing. Option B. Adding glucose to the water Incorrect. Adding glucose to the water increases the molal concentration of the solution. But because glucose does not dissociate, its van’t Hoff factor is 1, and will not be as effective as adding salts to the water. This makes glucose not as effective as salt in preventing the fountain from freezing. Option C. Decreasing the water’s temperature Incorrect. Decreasing the water’s temperature brings the water closer to its freezing point but will not prevent the water fountain from freezing. Option D. Decreasing the vapor pressure of water Incorrect. Decreasing the vapor pressure does not influence the water’s freezing point. Option E. Adding more water to the fountain Incorrect. Adding more water to the fountain will decrease the molal concentration of water, so it would decrease the extent of freezing point depression. Therefore, this is not an effective method of preventing his water fountain from freezing. Therefore, the answer is A .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving freezing point depression , we will need to understand the formula of freezing point depression: For this question, since we know that the solutions share the same molal concentration and the same solvent, we just need to calculate for the solute’s van’t Hoff factor to determine which aqueous solution will have the lowest freezing point. Among the given options, ionic compounds that dissociate into more ions when dissolved will have a greater effect on lowering the freezing point. Therefore, the compound with the highest van't Hoff factor will result in the lowest freezing point. In this case, CaCl 2 dissociates into three ions, so the aqueous solution with the lowest freezing point is 0.5 m CaCl 2 . Option A. 0.5 m CaCl 2 Correct. 0.5 m CaCl 2 dissociates into 1 Ca + and 2 Cl - , which means CaCl 2 has a van’t Hoff factor of 1 + 2 = 3. Since CaCl 2 has the highest van’t Hoff factor out of all options, this solution has the lowest freezing point. Option B. 0.5 m CH 3 OH Incorrect. 0.5 m CH 3 OH does not dissociate and stays as 1 molecule, which means CH 3 OH has a van’t Hoff factor of 1. Option C. 0.5 m NaNO 3 Incorrect. 0.5 m NaNO 3 dissociates into 1 Na + and 1 NO 3 - , which means NaNO 3 has a van’t Hoff factor of 1 + 1 = 2. Option D. 0.5 m KBr Incorrect. 0.5 m KBr dissociates into 1 K + and 1 Br - , which means KBr has a van’t Hoff factor of 1 + 1 = 2. Option E. 0.5 m NaCl Incorrect. 0.5 m NaCl dissociates into 1 Na + and 1 Cl - , which means NaCl has a van’t Hoff factor of 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the answer is A .",

The identity of the solute directly affects the extent of freezing point depression because the identity determines the solute’s van’t Hoff factor. Option B. Solubility of the solute Incorrect. The solubility of the solute directly affects the extent of freezing point depression because the solubility determines whether the solute dissociates into different number of ions or molecules. In fact, insoluble solutes won’t impact freezing point depression because it will not interact with the solvent molecules at all. Option C. Identity of the solvent Incorrect. The identity of the solvent directly affects the extent of freezing point depression because different solvents have different freezing point depression constants. The freezing point depression constant provides a measure of how much the freezing point of the solvent will decrease when a non-volatile solute is dissolved in it. Option D. Molal concentration of the solution Incorrect. The molal concentration of the solution directly affects the extent of freezing point depression. When more solute particles are dissolved in a solvent, the molal concentration increases, leading to a greater reduction in the solvent's freezing point. Option E. Molecular weight of the solute. Correct. The molecular weight of the solute does not directly affect the extent of freezing point depression because only the number of solute particles and mass of the solvent affects the molal concentration, which affects freezing point depression.
