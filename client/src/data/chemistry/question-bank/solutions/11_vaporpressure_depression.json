Its explanation is based on Raoult's law: STEP 1: First, we need to calculate the moles of the solute and solvent to calculate for the mole fraction of the solvent: STEP 2: Next, we need to calculate the mole fraction of the solvent: STEP 3: Then, we can use the mole fraction ( X solvent = 40/42) and the vapor pressure of pure water ( P° solvent = 50 torr) to calculate for the vapor pressure of the solution: In this case, the vapor pressure of a solution made by dissolving 360 g of glucose in 720 g of water is 48 torr.
