One of the most common ways for a solution to become supersaturated is to heat up the solution while mixing the solute. Option C. A solution containing a large amount of dissolved solute. Incorrect. This is the definition of a concentrated solution. While a supersaturated solution also contains a large amount of dissolved solute, this does not best describe a supersaturated solution. Option D. A solution containing the maximum amount of dissolved solute at a given temperature. Incorrect. This is the definition of a saturated solution, not a supersaturated solution. Option E.

STEP 2: Since we do not know the initial volume of solution A, we can denote it as “x” . Additionally, our final volume is found through the addition of both solution A’s and B’s volume and therefore can be denoted as “x +2 ” : STEP 3: Next, we can simplify our equation: STEP 4: Then, combine like terms, isolate, and solve for “x” (initial volume of solution A): Therefore, the answer is D .",
