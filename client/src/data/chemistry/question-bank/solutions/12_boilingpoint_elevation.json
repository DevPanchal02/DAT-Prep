      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving boiling point elevation , we need to know that boiling point elevation is a type of colligative property. The boiling point of a liquid (a solvent) will be higher when a non-volatile solute is added. The formula for boiling point elevation is: As we can see, the amount boiling point increases is proportional to the molal concentration of a solution. This means that an increase in molal concentration of a solution will result in an increase in the extent of boiling point elevation. Therefore, if a student wants to increase the boiling point of a liquid, a student should add more solute to the liquid to increase the molal concentration of the solution. Meanwhile, there is no such thing as adding more energy to the solute (Option B). Heating the liquid to a higher temperature (Option C) or increasing the vapor pressure of the liquid (Option D) will bring the solution closer to boiling, but not actually increase the boiling point of the solution. Therefore, the answer is E .",

The formula for boiling point elevation is: For this question, we need to keep in mind that k b values and m are the same for all the given solutions because they have the same solvent and the same molal concentration. Therefore, we only need to know the solute’s van’t Hoff factor of the solutions to determine which solution has the greatest boiling point elevation. Option A. 0.3 m MgCl 2 Incorrect. MgCl 2 dissociates into 1 Mg 2+ and 2 Cl - , which makes the van’t Hoff factor of MgCl 2 to be 1 + 2 = 3. Option B. 0.3 m Al 2 (SO 4 ) 3 Correct.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving boiling point elevation , we need to know that boiling point elevation is a type of colligative property. The boiling point of a liquid (a solvent) will be higher when a non-volatile solute is added. The formula for boiling point elevation is: STEP 1 : First, we need to calculate for the molal concentration of the solution, knowing that the solution has 3 moles of MgCl 2 and 1,000 g = 1 kg of water as a solvent: STEP 2 : Next, we need to calculate the solute’s van’t Hoff factor. MgCl 2 dissociates into 1 Mg 2+ and 2 Cl - , which means the van’t Hoff factor is 1 + 2 = 3. STEP 3 : Then, we need to calculate for the boiling point elevation constant for the solvent, knowing that the amount of boiling point elevation is 6°C ( ΔT b = 6), the molality of the solution is 3 m ( m = 3), and the solute’s van’t Hoff factor is 3 ( i = 3): Therefore, the answer is B .",
