      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving solid and gas solubility , we need to know the formula of Beer’s law: The formula indicates that the absorbance is proportional to the concentration of solution. Therefore, we can calculate the difference in concentrations between each solution. Solution A: 0.20 Solution B: 0.40 Solution C: 0.80 Solution D: 1.00 Option A. Solution A has 4 times the concentration of Solution B Incorrect. Because absorbance is proportion to the concentration of the solution, we can divide the absorbance value of A by B to find that solution A has 0.20/0.40 = 1/2 the concentration of solution B. Option B. Solution B has 2 times the concentration of Solution C Incorrect. Because absorbance is proportion to the concentration of the solution, we can divide the absorbance value of B by C to find that solution B has 0.40/0.80 = 1/2 the concentration of solution C. Option C. Solution C has 1/4 times the concentration of Solution A Incorrect. Because absorbance is proportion to the concentration of the solution, we can divide the absorbance value of C by A to find that solution C has 0.80/0.20 = 4 times the concentration of solution A. Option D. Solution D has 1/5 times the concentration of Solution B Incorrect. Because absorbance is proportion to the concentration of the solution, we can divide the absorbance value of D by B to find that solution D has 1.00/0.40 = 5/2 = 2.5 times the concentration of solution B. Option E. Solution D has 5/4 times the concentration of Solution C Correct. Because absorbance is proportion to the concentration of the solution, we can divide the absorbance value of D by C to find that solution D has 1.00/0.80 = 5/4 times the concentration of solution C, which is correct. Therefore, the answer is E .",
