Strong electrolytes completely dissociate in water. Option B. Examples of weak electrolytes are strong acids Incorrect. Examples of weak electrolytes include weak acids and weak bases . Option C. Examples of strong electrolytes include soluble ionic compounds Correct. Soluble ionic compounds are examples of strong electrolytes because the compounds completely dissociate into ions in water. Option D. Electrolytes do not dissociate in water Incorrect. Strong electrolytes completely dissociate in water. Weak electrolytes partially dissociate in water.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving electrolytes , we must compare both the solute and solvent of each provided option. In terms of electrical conductivity, NaCl outperforms glucose due to its composition of Na + and Cl - ions. NaCl is an ionic compound, while glucose is classified as a polar covalent compound. Consequently, when NaCl dissolves, it dissociates into Na + and Cl - ions, resulting in a more pronounced ionic nature compared to glucose, which does not dissolve into ions. As a result, NaCl is a better conductor of electricity. Comparing between water and ethanol, water is a more effective solvent for dissolving NaCl compared to ethanol. Water, which can form more hydrogen bonds per molecule compared to ethanol, exhibits a stronger ability to dissolve NaCl. Therefore, NaCl will dissolve more effectively in water compared to ethanol. Therefore, the best conductor of electricity is NaCl in water . Therefore, the answer is C .",
