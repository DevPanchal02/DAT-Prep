Natural systems evolve towards greater disorder. For example, when gases mix, solids dissolve, or complex molecules break into simpler components, the overall entropy of the system rises. This increase in disorder tends to drive reactions to occur spontaneously (or without external intervention).

H 2 O (l) → H 2 O (g) Incorrect. Because H 2 O changes from liquid to gas, this reaction is entropically favorable . Option C. NaCl (s) → Na + (aq) + Cl - (aq) Incorrect. Because NaCl dissociates from 1 reactant molecule into 2 product molecules, there is an increase in the number of molecules, making this reaction entropically favorable . Option D. 2 Na (s) + Cl 2(g) → 2 NaCl (s) Correct.
