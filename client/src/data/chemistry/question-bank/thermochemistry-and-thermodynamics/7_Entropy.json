      "concept_text": "Keep in mind that we need to find the process that is not accompanied by an increase in entropy, which refers to the degree of randomness in a system. Option A. Sublimation of carbon dioxide Incorrect. The sublimation of carbon dioxide (CO 2( s ) ­ → CO 2( g ) ) involves the change of ordered, solid carbon dioxide into a less ordered and freely moving gaseous carbon dioxide, which increases entropy. Option B. Dissolving sugar in water Incorrect. The dissolution of sugar in water involves the breakdown of ordered, solid sugar particles into a less ordered aqueous solution of sugar water, which increases entropy. Option C. Heating a balloon filled with a gas Incorrect. Heating a balloon filled with gas raises the temperature of the gas particles, increasing velocity and randomness of the gas, which increases entropy. Option D. Freezing of water Correct. Freezing water (H 2 O ( l ) → H 2 O ( s ) ) involves the change of freely flowing water into ordered, solid ice, which decreases entropy. Option E. Evaporation of water Incorrect. Evaporating water (H 2 O ( l ) → H 2 O ( g ) ) involves the change of liquid water into a more freely moving water vapor, which increases entropy.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving entropy , we need to recall that the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics tells us that the entropy of the universe is always increasing. This is why heat always flows from regions of high to low temperatures – heat spreads because it allows thermal energy to become more spread out amongst the particles, which allows for an increase in the overall entropy of the particles. If heat were to flow spontaneously from a cold to hot object, it would lead to an overall decrease in entropy, which violates the second law of thermodynamics. For Option C, the fact that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but is converted, is defined by the first law of thermodynamics (law of conservation of energy). Meanwhile, for Option D, a substance at 0 K has no motion of kinetic energy is an observation of the third law of thermodynamics . Therefore, the answer is B .",

      "concept_text": "Ca 2+ ( aq ) + 2 OH - ( aq ) ↔ Ca(OH) 2( s ) Option A. The reaction tends to the left to increase entropy Correct. There are three aqueous molecules on the left, but only one solid molecule on the right. This implies that the reaction moving to the left increases the number of molecules, which increases entropy. Option B. The reaction tends to the right to increase stability Incorrect. Dissociating the molecule increases the number of intermolecular bonds between the water and the molecular components of Ca(OH) 2 , which implies that moving the reaction to the left increases stability. In addition, molecular stability is not usually a consideration when it comes to solubility – it is usually thermodynamics and the increase in entropy that play a role. Option C. The reaction tends to the left to release energy Incorrect. For the reaction to move towards the left, energy is absorbed to break bonds in Ca(OH) 2 . Although the reaction does tend towards the left, this is not the correct reasoning. Option D. The reaction tends to the right because Ca(OH) 2 is insoluble Incorrect. According to the solubility rules, OH - is usually insoluble, but when paired with Ca 2+ is soluble. Therefore, Ca(OH) 2 is soluble. Option E. The reaction tends to the right because the molecule is larger Incorrect. The size of the molecule will play an insignificant role to decide which direction the reaction tends towards – instead, factors such as the stoichiometric coefficients, temperature, volume, pressure, and thermodynamics are more important.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving entropy , we need to recall that the third law of thermodynamics tells us that the entropy of a pure crystalline substance at absolute zero temperature (0 Kelvin) is zero. At this temperature, there will be no motion of kinetic energy of the substance, which implies that it will also have no entropy. Note that 0 K is equivalent to -273 o C. Therefore, the answer is B .",

As we can see, the only system that is becoming more organized is the condensation of steam, in which freely moving, gaseous H 2 O becomes liquid H 2 O. The other options result in an increase in randomness, or entropy. Therefore, the answer is E .",
