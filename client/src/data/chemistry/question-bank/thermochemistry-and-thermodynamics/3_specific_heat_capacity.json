Option A . Increasing the temperature for a substance with a high C value is more difficult Incorrect. Increasing the temperature of a substance with a high specific heat capacity is more difficult since it requires more energy to raise its temperature. Option B. Specific heat capacity differs between different substances Incorrect. Specific heat capacity values will differ between different substances since they have different capacities to be heated or cooled. Option C. The unit for specific heat capacity is J•g -1 • o C -1 Incorrect. Specific heat capacity (C) is defined as the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 g of a substance by 1 o C, and its units are in J•g -1 • o C -1 . Option D. Specific heat capacity does not change for substances in different states Correct. Specific heat capacity values will differ between different states of the same substance since the properties of the substance including the capacity to be heated or cooled will change depending on the state of the substance. Option E. A substance with a low C value will cool down more easily Incorrect. A substance with a low specific heat capacity will be heated up more easily since it requires less energy to raise its temperature, which also means that it will cool down more easily.

When heat is absorbed by a substance, the amount of heat increases , and the resulting q value is positive. Option B. When calculating heat, only the final temperature is considered Incorrect. To calculate heat, we use q = mCΔT, where ΔT is the change in temperature. This means that both final and initial temperatures are considered to determine the change in temperature that has occurred. Option C. An increase in heat of a substance results in an increase of its specific heat capacity Incorrect. Specific heat capacity (C) is a property of a substance and is defined as the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 g of a substance by 1 o C. This property is not affected by changes in heat. Option D. A higher mass of a substance requires more heat to increase its temperature Correct. To calculate heat, we use q = mCΔT. Since heat (q) is directly proportional to the mass (m) of a substance, if mass increases , then the amount of heat required also increase s. Option E. A higher change in temperature results in a smaller change in heat energy Incorrect. To calculate heat, we use q = mCΔT. Since the change in temperature (ΔT) is directly proportional to the heat (q), if there is a higher change in temperature, the change in heat energy is larger . Therefore, the answer is D.",

      "concept_text": "STEP 1: To solve this problem involving specific heat capacity we can recall that specific heat capacity (C) is defined as the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 g of a substance by 1 o C. In this case, we need to calculate the specific heat capacities (C) of each substance. The substance that has the lowest heat capacity requires the least energy to raise its temperature, and therefore can be heated up the fastest. STEP 2: We know the equation for calculating specific heat capacity is as follows: q = heat (J), m = mass (g), C = specific heat capacity (J•g -1 • o C -1 ), Δ T = temperature change (K/ o C) Since each substance has the same mass, we can disregard it from the equation because we are only comparing the differences in their heat capacities. If we then rearrange the equation for specific heat capacity (C), we obtain: STEP 3: We can now solve for the specific heat capacities for each substance. For example, for substance A: The remaining specific heat capacities of the other substances are as follows: Substance Energy added (J) Change in temperature ( o C) Specific heat capacity ( J • g -1 • o C -1 ) A 250 10 25 B 400 20 20 C 200 5 40 D 350 7 50 E 300 30 10 Option E (10 J • g -1 • o C -1 ) has the lowest heat capacity, so it can be heated up the fastest. Therefore, the answer is E .",
