      "concept_text": "Option A. ΔH° f refers to the enthalpy change under any temperature or pressure Incorrect. ΔH° f refers to the standard enthalpy of formation, which is the enthalpy change that occurs when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. Therefore, the enthalpy change occurs under specific temperature and pressure conditions when elements are in their standard states, not in all conditions. Option B. The ΔH° rxn is calculated by taking ΔH° bonds formed minus ΔH° bonds broken Incorrect. The ΔH° rxn is calculated by taking ΔH° bonds broken minus ΔH° bonds formed . Option C. Breaking bonds is an endothermic process Correct. Breaking chemical bonds requires an input of energy (endothermic process) because it breaks the attractive forces between atoms. On the other hand, bond formation releases energy (exothermic process). Option D. Hess’s law cannot be used to calculate ΔH° rxn Incorrect. There are 3 ways to calculate for ΔH° rxn : bond enthalpy, enthalpy of formation, and Hess’s law. Hess's law allows for the calculation of ΔH° rxn by using the enthalpy changes of a series of reactions, including the formation reactions of the reactants and products. Therefore, Hess’s law can be used to calculate ΔH° rxn . Option E. S, N, and O exist as diatomic molecules in their standard state Incorrect. The elements that exist as diatomic molecules in their standard states are H, N, O, F, Cl, Br, and I. Sulfur does not exist as a diatomic molecule under standard conditions, but as a polyatomic molecule composed of 8 sulfur atoms, known as S 8 . Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "Option A. The reaction is exothermic under all conditions Incorrect. To determine if the reaction is endothermic or exothermic, we need to look at the sign of ΔH° rxn . In this case, the given reaction has negative enthalpy change, indicating that the reaction is exothermic, but this is only true under standard conditions. Therefore, the reaction is not necessarily exothermic under all conditions. Option B. The reaction is endothermic under all conditions Incorrect. The reaction is exothermic under standard conditions, which can be seen by the sign of ΔH° rxn . Option C. ΔH° rxn can be calculated by [4(C–H) + 2(O=O)] – [2(O–H) + 2(C=O)] Incorrect. The ΔH° rxn is calculated by taking ΔH° bonds broken minus ΔH° bonds formed . Therefore, ΔH° rxn can be calculated by taking [4(C–H) + 2(O=O)] – [4(O–H) + 2(C=O)]. This is because 4 C-H bonds are broken, 2 O=O bonds are broken, 4 O-H bonds are formed, and 2 C=O bonds are formed during this reaction. Option D. The products are at a lower energy state than the reactants Correct. The negative value of ΔH° rxn indicates that the products are at a lower energy state than the reactants. This means that the products formed are more stable than the reactants. Essentially, energy was released during the reaction. Option E. The products are at the same energy state as the reactants Incorrect. The negative value of ΔH° rxn indicates that the products are at a lower energy state than the reactants. Therefore, the answer is D .",

We will do this by multiplying each coefficient by 3: STEP 2: Then, we can calculate for the enthalpy change of the reaction when 3 moles of H 2 O ( l ) are produced: In this case, the option that correctly describes the enthalpy change of the reaction when 3 moles of H 2 O ( l ) are produced is 855 kJ released by the system. If the sign of the enthalpy change was positive, that would indicate that 855 kJ is absorbed by the system. Since our sign is negative (-855 kJ), this indicates that energy is released, or lost, by the system. Therefore, the answer is A .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving standardenthalpy change, we need recall that the standard enthalpy of reaction (ΔH° rxn ) is the enthalpy change that occurs in a system when a given chemical reaction includes all reactants and products in their standard states. Substances are in their standard states if they exist in their most stable and common solid or gaseous form under standard conditions (25 °C and 1 atm). For example, NaCl ( s ) is in its standard state when it is in solid form because under standard conditions, NaCl is solid. Here are other common elements and compounds under standard conditions: In this case, the correct reaction for the standard enthalpy change of solid CaCO 3( s ) formation is Ca ( s ) + C ( s ) + 3/2 O 2( g ) à CaCO 3( s ) because the reactants (Ca ( s ) , C ( s ) , O 2( g ) ) are in their standard states, and the product (CaCO 3( s ) ) is in its standard state as well. Option A. Ca(OH) 2(aq) + 2 H 2 CO 3(aq) à CaCO 3(s) + H 2 O (l) Incorrect. This reaction is not the correct reaction for the standard enthalpy change of solid CaCO 3( s ) formation because it involves the formation of CaCO 3( s ) from reactants that are not in their standard states and components (ex: Ca(OH) 2 and H 2 CO 3 are not in their standard states and can be further broken down into component elements). Option B. CaO (s) + CO 2(g) à CaCO 3(s) Incorrect. This reaction is not the correct reaction for the standard enthalpy change because both reactants, CaO and CO 2 , are not in their standard states. Instead, they can be further broken down into component elements. Option C. Ca 2+ (aq) + CO 3 2- (aq) à CaCO 3(s) Incorrect. This reaction is not the correct reaction for the standard enthalpy change because both Ca 2+ and CO 3 2- are not in their standard states. Instead, Ca should exist as a neutral atom in its standard state, and CO 3 2- can be further broken down into component elements. Option D. Ca (s) + C (s) + 3/2 O 2(g) à CaCO 3(s) Correct. This reaction is a standard reaction because the reactants (Ca ( s ) , C ( s ) , O 2( g ) ) are in their standard states, and the product CaCO 3( s ) is in its standard state as well. Option E. 2 CaCO 3(s) à 2 Ca (s) + 2 C (s) + 2 O 3(g) Incorrect. This reaction is not the correct reaction for the standard enthalpy change because this reaction represents the decomposition of calcium carbonate into its elements. Therefore, the answer is D .",
