      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving heat transfer and work , we will need to know the formula for the change in internal energy and work: Δ E = change in internal energy, q = heat, w = work w = work, P = pressure (always positive), Δ V = change in volume ( V final – V initial ) In this case, since heat is released, we know that q is negative ( q < 0 ). We also know that when the work is done by the gas (system) on the surrounding, w is negative ( w < 0 ). This is because when work is being done by the gas on the surroundings, the volume of the gas expands. We know that the formula for work is w = - PΔV . During the expansion of a gas, ΔV is positive, which makes work ( w ) to be negative. Since both w and q are both negative, and Δ E = q + w , Δ E must be negative as well. Therefore, in a chemical reaction that releases heat and increases the work done by the gas on the surrounding, the resulting relationship is ΔE < 0, q < 0, w < 0. Therefore, the answer is D .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving heat transfer and work , we will need to know the formula for the change in internal energy and work: Δ E = change in internal energy, q = heat, w = work w = work, P = pressure (always positive), Δ V = change in volume ( V final – V initial ) When work is done on the system by having external forces or pressure, ΔV is negative because the V final is lower than V initial . When ΔV is negative, then the work ( w ) is positive because w = - PΔV . Therefore, the correct option is when the change of volume is negative, work is done on the system. Option A. When there is no heat exchange, there is no change in internal energy Incorrect. The formula for the change in internal energy is ΔE = q + w . The formula implies that the internal energy (∆E ) of a system can change even if there is no heat exchange ( q = 0). It can change due to work done on or by the system. Option B. When there is no change in volume, the internal energy cannot change Incorrect. The formula for the change in internal energy is ΔE = q + w . If there is no change in volume ( ΔV = 0), it means no work is done by or on the system ( w = 0). Therefore, the equation simplifies to ΔE = q . In this case, the change in internal energy ( ∆E ) is equal to the heat transfer ( q ). Therefore, when there is no change in volume ( ΔV = 0), the internal energy can change by the heat transfer. Option C. When there is no change in internal energy, work is always done on the system Incorrect. The formula for the change in internal energy is ΔE = q + w . We can see that if there is no change in internal energy, change in work can be equal in value and opposite to heat exchanged. Therefore, we cannot say that work is always done on the system when there is no change in internal change because work can also be done by the system as well. Option D. When the gas inside a piston expands, the work done on the system is positive Incorrect. When the gas inside a piston expands, the work done on the system is negative. This is because the gas is doing work on the surrounding, and energy is leaving the system. Also, we know that the formula for work is w = - PΔV . During the expansion of a gas, ΔV is positive, which makes work ( w ) to be negative. During the compression of a gas, ΔV is negative, which makes work ( w ) to be positive. Option E. When the change of volume is negative, work is done on the system Correct. When work is done on the system by having external forces or pressure, ΔV is negative because the V final is lower than V initial . When ΔV is negative, then the work ( w ) is positive because w = - PΔV . This implies that work is being done on the system. Therefore, the answer is E.",

Since the work produced by a piston is larger than zero, the change in volume must be negative. Since ΔV = V final – V initial , this means V final is smaller than V initial . For the change in volume to be negative, the volume of gas is compressed. Therefore, the answer is B .",
