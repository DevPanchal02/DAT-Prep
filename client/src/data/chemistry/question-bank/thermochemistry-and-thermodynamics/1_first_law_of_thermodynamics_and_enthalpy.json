Option A. Heating up your food with a microwave Incorrect. A microwave uses microwaves, which are a form of electromagnetic waves, to heat up food. This is an example of heat transfer via radiation . Option B. A lizard heating itself up by laying in the sun Incorrect. The sun uses electromagnetic radiation to heat up the Earth (and the lizard). This is an example of heat transfer via radiation . Option C. An ice cube melting in the palm of your hand Incorrect. The ice cube, which is in direct contact with your hand, is warmed using the heat from the hand. This is an example of heat transfer via conduction . Option D. Observing steam rising from a hot cup of tea Correct. Steam from a hot cup of tea rises because the warm air rises, which is an example of convection . Option E. Sitting on a hot, metal bench and burning your legs Incorrect. Your legs, which are in direct contact with the bench, are warmed using the heat from the bench. This is an example of heat transfer via conduction . Therefore, the answer is D.",

      "concept_text": "Option A. Law of conservation of mass Incorrect. The law of conservation of mass states that, during a chemical reaction, the total mass of the products must equal the total mass of the reactants. In order words, mass cannot be created or destroyed during a chemical reaction, only conserved. Option B. Charles's law Incorrect. Charles’s law is a gas law that describes how gases tend to expand when heated: the volume of an ideal gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature at constant pressure. Option C. Law of conservation of energy Correct. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be destroyed nor created, only altered to another form. Recall, this is also the first law of thermodynamics. Option D. Law of mass action Incorrect. The law of mass action states that the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the active masses of the reacting substances at a constant temperature. Option E. Law of constant proportions Incorrect. The law of constant proportions states that chemical compounds are made up of elements that are present in a fixed ratio by mass. For example, the hydrogen to oxygen ratio of pure water is always 2:1. Any pure sample of a compound will always consist of the same elements, present in the same ratio by mass.

As a scientist, you get to decide what you define as the system! An example of the law of conservation of energy is the transformation of electrical energy to light energy (a.k.a., radiant energy). However, it is important to note that transfers of energy are not 100% efficient , and some of the starting energy is released as thermal energy (heat). In fact, only about 10 percent of the energy used by a regular incandescent light bulb goes toward producing light – the other 90 percent is wasted as heat. So, whenever there is a transfer of energy, some amount of useful energy will become “useless”. Therefore, the answer is E.",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving enthalpy and activation energy , let’s first define enthalpy as the total amount of heat energy within a system. The heat that is absorbed by the system or released into the surroundings is the enthalpy change: To solve this question, we also need to understand the activation energy. The activation energy is the minimum energy barrier that a reaction needs to overcome for the reaction to proceed. STEP 1: First, we need to determine if the graph depicts an endothermic or exothermic reaction. Since the energy of the reactants (start of the graph) is greater than the energy of the products (end of the graph), this is an exothermic reaction. STEP 2: Next, we need to determine the activation energy.  Since the transition state is approximately halfway between 100 kJ and 125 kJ, we can extrapolate the potential energy to be 115 kJ. The potential energy of the reactants is 75 kJ. In this case, the activation energy is 115 kJ – 75 kJ = 40 kJ . Therefore, the answer is A.",
