      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving the spontaneity of reactions , let’s review the Gibb’s free energy equation, and the conditions in which Gibb’s free energy is spontaneous or non-spontaneous: ΔG = ΔH – TΔS ΔG = change in free energy, ΔH = change in enthalpy, T = temperature in Kelvin, ΔS = change in entropy In this case, we can see that when ΔH > 0 and ΔS > 0, the reaction is spontaneous at high temperatures but nonspontaneous at low temperatures. Option A. ΔH > 0, ΔS > 0 Correct. This reaction is spontaneous at high temperatures and non-spontaneous at low temperatures, because a large temperature (T) value increases the negative contribution of the TΔS component, which leads to an overall negative ΔG value (spontaneous). Meanwhile, a small temperature (T) value decreases the negative contribution of the TΔS component, which leads to an overall positive ΔG value (non-spontaneous). Option B. ΔH > 0, ΔS < 0 Incorrect. This reaction is nonspontaneous at all temperatures, because both the ΔH component and the -TΔS component is always positive (because of the negative ΔS value). Therefore, regardless of the temperature, the ΔG value is positive, which is non-spontaneous. Option C. ΔH < 0, ΔS > 0 Incorrect. This reaction is spontaneous at all temperatures, because both the ΔH component and the -TΔS component is always negative (because of the positive ΔS value). Therefore, regardless of the temperature, the ΔG value is negative, which is spontaneous. Option D. ΔH < 0, ΔS < 0 Incorrect. This reaction is spontaneous at low temperatures and non-spontaneous at high temperatures, because a low temperature (T) value decreases the positive contribution of the TΔS component, which leads to an overall negative ΔG value (spontaneous). Meanwhile, a large temperature (T) value increases the positive contribution of the TΔS component, which leads to an overall positive ΔG value (non-spontaneous). Option E. ΔH = 0, ΔS = 0 Incorrect. When ΔH = 0 and ΔS = 0, the change in free energy ΔG = 0 regardless of the temperature. Therefore, the answer is A .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving the spontaneity of reactions , let’s review the Gibb’s free energy equation, and the conditions in which Gibb’s free energy is spontaneous or non-spontaneous: ΔG = ΔH – TΔS ΔG = change in free energy, ΔH = change in enthalpy, T = temperature in Kelvin, ΔS = change in entropy The entropy of the universe is the sum of the entropy of the system and the surroundings: ΔS universe = ΔS system + ΔS surrounding In this case, we have to recognize that in spontaneous reactions, the entropy of the universe always increases. So, in spontaneous reactions, the entropy change of the universe is always positive. The ΔS value in the Gibbs free energy equation is not the change of the entropy of the universe , but rather the change of entropy of the system . Thus, although the change of entropy of the system could be negative in a spontaneous reaction, the overall change of entropy of the universe is always positive (becoming more disordered for all spontaneous reactions). Option A. ΔG changes in the presence of a catalyst Incorrect. ΔG is not dependent on the presence of a catalyst and thus does not change in the presence of a catalyst. Catalysts do not change any thermodynamic properties of a reaction but only change the kinetic properties of how fast the reaction goes. Option B. A reaction with ΔG > 0 is spontaneous Incorrect. A reaction with ΔG > 0 is non-spontaneous. Instead, a reaction with ΔG < 0 is spontaneous with free energy released to the surroundings. Option C. ΔG° indicates the energy change at a very high temperature Incorrect. The ° symbol behind the ΔG indicates the standard conditions at 298 K, 1 atm, and 1.0 M concentration. Option D. The entropy of the universe always increases Correct. Recalling the equation of the entropy of the universe, ΔS universe = ΔS system + ΔS surrounding , the entropy of the universe always increases in a spontaneous reaction. The ΔS value in the Gibbs free energy equation indicates the change in entropy of the system , not the universe . Thus, a spontaneous reaction can have negative ΔS system values, but it is important to recognize that the ΔS universe is always positive, becoming more disordered. Option E. A ll reactions are spontaneous at very high temperatures Incorrect. Reactions with a positive ΔH and negative ΔS are non-spontaneous at all temperatures, and reactions with a negative ΔH and negative ΔS are non-spontaneous at high temperatures. Thus, not all reactions are spontaneous at very high temperatures. Therefore, the answer is D .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving endergonic and exergonic reactions , let’s go over the definitions together: In this case, endothermic refers to the change in enthalpy of the system, which is different from endergonic which refers to the change in free energy of the system. Thus, endergonic and endothermic are not interchangeable terms. Keep in mind that we need to find the incorrect statement about the endergonic and exergonic reactions. Option A. Endergonic reactions have a positive ΔG Incorrect. Endergonic reactions absorb free energy from the surroundings and are considered non-spontaneous reactions with a positive ΔG. Option B. Endergonic and endothermic are interchangeable terms Correct. Endergonic refers to the change in free energy of the system while endothermic refers to the change in enthalpy of the system. Thus, they are not interchangeable terms. Option C. Free energy is released in an exergonic reaction Incorrect. Exergonic reaction, a spontaneous reaction with a negative ΔG, releases free energy to the surroundings. Option D. Products are favored at equilibrium in an exergonic reaction Incorrect. In an exergonic reaction where the ΔG is negative, the equilibrium constant K eq > 1, meaning the products are favored at equilibrium. Option E. A reaction is exergonic at all temperatures when ΔH < 0 and ΔS > 0 Incorrect. Recalling that the Gibbs free energy equation is ΔG = ΔH – TΔS, when ΔH is negative and ΔS is positive, ΔG is negative at all temperatures, which means that the reaction is exergonic, or spontaneous.

The reactant side has 0 gas moles while the product side has 3 moles of oxygen gas. Having more gas moles in the product compared to the reactant indicates an increase in disorder, and therefore an increase in the entropy of the system. In addition, there are 7 moles of products but only 2 moles of reactants, which is another indication of an increase in entropy. Since we now know that ΔH and ΔS are both positive and we are given a high-temperature condition, the reaction would be spontaneous. This is because a large temperature (T) value increases the negative contribution of the -TΔS component, which leads to an overall negative ΔG value (spontaneous). Therefore, the answer is E .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving Gibbs free energy , we need to use the Gibbs free energy formula to calculate the ΔH, the change in enthalpy: ΔG = ΔH – TΔS Where ΔG = change in free energy, ΔH = change in enthalpy, T = temperature in Kelvin, ΔS = change in entropy. STEP 1 : First, we can rearrange our Gibbs free energy equation to solve for the change in enthalpy of the reaction. ΔG = ΔH – TΔS ΔH = ΔG + TΔS STEP 2 : Next, let’s convert our temperature in degrees Celsius to Kelvins. It is important to remember that the temperature (T) used in the Gibbs free energy is in Kelvins , not Celsius . T = 27°C + 273 = 300 K STEP 3 : Then, let’s convert the change in the free energy (ΔG) from kilojoules (kJ) to joules (J). ΔG = 10 kJ = 10,000 J STEP 4 : Finally, let’s then plug in our given values to the equation: ΔH = 10,000 + 300(100) ΔH = 10,000 + 30,000 ΔH = 40,000 J•mol -1 Therefore, the answer is E .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving the spontaneity of reactions , let’s review the Gibb’s free energy equation, and the conditions in which Gibb’s free energy is spontaneous or non-spontaneous: ΔG = ΔH – TΔS ΔG = change in free energy, ΔH = change in enthalpy, T = temperature in Kelvin, ΔS = change in entropy In this case, we can first determine the change in entropy of the reaction by looking at the number of gas moles in the reaction. The reactant side has a total of 3 gas moles while the product side has a total of 2 moles. Having fewer gas moles in the product compared to the reactant indicates a decrease in disorder, and therefore a decrease in the entropy of the system. Since we now know that ΔH and ΔS are both negative, the reaction is spontaneous at low temperatures . This is because a small temperature (T) value decreases the positive contribution of the -TΔS value which leads to an overall negative ΔG value, a spontaneous reaction. If we were to increase the temperature, the positive contribution of the -TΔS value would exceed the negative ΔH value, leading to a positive ΔG value, which is nonspontaneous. Therefore, the answer is B .",

Recall that the reaction is non-spontaneous when ΔG > 0 and spontaneous when ΔG < 0. So, to calculate when the reaction moves from being a non-spontaneous reaction to a spontaneous reaction, we would need to set ΔG = 0 as this is when the crossover from non-spontaneous to spontaneous occurs.
