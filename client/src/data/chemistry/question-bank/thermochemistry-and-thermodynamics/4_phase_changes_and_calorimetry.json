Keep in mind the units for mass differ in the heating step (g) and in the phase change step (kg): Heating from -20 o C to -10 o C (units for mass must be in g): Phase change (melting) at -10 o C (units for mass must be in kg): STEP 3: Finally, we can determine the total change in heat energy by combining the change in heat of the substance, and the amount of heat change during the phase change: Since the q value is positive , this means that the heat energy is absorbed during the process.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving phase changes and calorimetry , we will need to review how to calculate the change in heat energy of a sample and the change in heat energy during a phase change. The equations are below: q = heat energy (J), m = mass (g), C = specific heat capacity (J•g -1 • o C -1 ), ΔT = change in temperature ( o C) As well as the formula to calculate the change in enthalpy during a phase change: q = heat energy (J), m = mass (kg), ΔH = change in enthalpy (J•kg -1 ) STEP 1: First, we can break down the reaction into several steps to calculate the total amount of heat energy required for the process: STEP 2: Next, we can solve for each step. Keep in mind the units for mass differ in the heating step (g) and in the phase change step (kg). Cooling from 20 o C to -80 o C (units must be in g): Phase change (deposition) at -80 o C (units must be in kg): STEP 3: Finally, we can determine the total change in heat energy by combining the change in heat of the substance, and the amount of heat change during the phase change: Since the q value is negative , this means that the heat energy is released by the CO 2 . We can see that 880 kJ of heat is released by the deposition process. Therefore, the answer is C .",
