STEP 1: First, let’s assume that compound A’s reaction follows first order kinetics (the half-life does not change based on concentration) This means that 50 g of sample A after the first half-life will have 50 × ½ = 25 g remaining. After two half-lives, 25 × ½ = 12.5 g will remain. Finally, after three half-lives, 12.5 × ½ = 6.25 g will remain. STEP 2: Since each half-life for compound A is 2 minutes, 3 half-lives is 3 × 2 = 6 minutes. The question tells us that our 50 g sample reduces to 6.25 g after 6 minutes, which aligns with our assumption that compound A follows first order kinetics. If the sample reduces to 6.25 g in a time less than or greater than 6 minutes, this tells us that our initial assumption that compound A’s reaction follows first order kinetics is incorrect. STEP 3: Knowing that compound A’s reaction follows first order kinetics, we can take a look at each answer choice and see that the only rate law that is first order is Rate = k[A] .

STEP 2: Next, we can determine the concentration of X, with an initial concentration of 20 M after 5 half-lives: 1st half-life: 20 × ½ = 10 2nd half-life: 10 × ½ = 5 3rd half-life: 5 × ½ = 5/2 4th half-life: 5/2 × ½ = 5/4 5th half-life: 5/4 × ½ = 5/8 In this case, we can conclude that the concentration of X after 12 minutes is 5/8 M. Therefore, the answer is B .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving half-life , we need to recall that the half-life of a substance is the time it takes to convert half of the reactants to products. STEP 1: First, we know that A → 2B + 3C is a first order reaction, so its half-life of 8 hours does not change based on concentration. Since we are interested in the concentration of B after 1 day (24 hours), we are interested in 24 ÷ 8 = 3 half-lives. STEP 2: Next, we can determine the concentration of A after three half-lives, knowing that is has an initial concentration of 2.4 M: 2.4 × ½ × ½ × ½ = 0.3 M STEP 3: 0.3 M is the concentration of A after three half-lives. We can subtract 0.3 M from 2.4 M to determine the concentration of A that has been reacted in this amount of time: 2.4 M – 0.3 M = 2.1 M STEP 4: In A → 2B + 3C, for each mole of A consumed, 2 moles of B are formed. This implies that when 2.1 M of A has been consumed, 2.1 × 2 = 4.2 M of B have been formed. Therefore, the answer is E .",
