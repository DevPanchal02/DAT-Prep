      "concept_text": "Keep in mind we need to find the change that does not increase the rate of the reaction. Option A. Increasing the temperature Incorrect. Increasing the temperature increases the velocity of the molecules, which allows for more collisions and increased energy for each collision to succeed. Thus, the rate of reaction increases with increasing temperature. Option B. Adding a catalyst Incorrect. A catalyst is a substance that lowers the activation energy of a reaction without being consumed. By lowering the energy required for the reaction to proceed, the catalyst increases the rate of a reaction, because more particles have sufficient energy to react. Option C. Decreasing the particle size Incorrect. Decreasing the particle size increases the surface area of the molecules available for collisions, which increases the rate of the reaction. For example, imagine a big chunk of salt versus smaller pieces of salt in a container of water. The solution with smaller pieces of salt would dissolve faster or have a faster reaction rate. Option D . Lowering the activation energy Incorrect. Lowering the activation energy increases the rate of the reaction because the energy required for the reaction to proceed is lower. Option E. Decreasing reactant concentration Correct. Decreasing the reactant concentration often decreases the rate of the reaction because there are fewer molecules available for collisions for the reaction to occur. But remember that for zero-order reactions, the rate is independent of concentration, meaning the decrease in the reactant concentration would not affect the rate according to the rate laws. Therefore, the answer is E .",

Thus, we could obtain 4/3 as the ratio of Fe ( s ) being produced to C ( s ) being consumed. However, we can also take a more systematic approach to this problem: STEP 1 : Let’s visualize this through the rate expression, accounting for the relationship that for every 3 moles of C ( s ) consumed, 4 moles of Fe ( s ) are being formed: STEP 2 : For this question, we will remove the negative sign for the C ( s ) because we are interested in the absolute values of the rates, not the direction of the rates.

STEP 1: First, let’s write out the rate expression, accounting for the relationship that for every 5 moles of O 2(g) consumed, 3 moles of CO 2(g) is being formed. STEP 2: Next, let’s plug in the value for the change in the concentration of O 2(g) with a negative sign as it is being consumed, or decreases in concentration: We’ll plug this value into the rate expression: STEP 3: Finally, we can simplify the rate expression to obtain the rate of formation of CO 2(g) : We can then multiply both sides by 3: Therefore, the answer is C .",

STEP 2 : Next, let’s plug in the value for the change in the concentration of NH 3( g ) : STEP 3 : We will go ahead and cancel out the Δt term in the denominator on both sides and further simplify the rate expression to obtain the rate of consumption of H 2( g ) : The negative sign in the front indicates that the moles of H 2 are being consumed (concentration decreases). Thus, we can say that 9 M of H 2( g ) are being consumed for every 6 M of NH 3( g ) produced. Therefore, the answer is D .",
