This can be best done by either adding a catalyst or increasing the temperature . Option A. removing the catalyst. Incorrect. Catalysts help speed up reactions by lowering the activation energy of a reaction (often by providing an alternative pathway for the reaction). Therefore, removing the catalyst does not help molecules gain sufficient energy to overcome the E a barrier. Option B. increasing the temperature. Correct. Increasing the temperature provides molecules with more energy that is needed to overcome the E a barrier. Option C. increasing concentration. Incorrect. Increasing the concentration certainly can increase the number of collisions between molecules, but do not specifically help molecules gain sufficient energy to overcome the E a barrier, which is being asked for in this question. Option D. placing the reaction in the dark. Incorrect. Placing reactions in light sometimes provides energy to carry out reactions.

Keep in mind we need to find the method that does not increase the rate of the reaction by increasing the rate constant (k). Option A. Increasing temperature Incorrect. According to the Arrhenius equation, increasing the temperature gives more molecules sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy (E a ) needed for a reaction to occur, thereby increasing the rate constant. Option B. Decreasing activation energy Incorrect. According to the Arrhenius equation, decreasing the activation energy gives more molecules sufficient energy to overcome the lowered activation energy (E a ) needed for a reaction to occur, thereby increasing the rate constant. Option C. Increasing the concentration Correct. There is no concentration factor in the Arrhenius reaction. This means that changing the concentration has no impact on the rate constant k . In fact, changes in concentration do not change the rate constant ( k ), only the rate law itself (ex: Rate = k [A]). Option D. Adding a catalyst Incorrect. Adding a catalyst decreases the activation energy, usually by providing reactions with an alternative pathway, which gives more molecules sufficient energy to overcome the lowered activation energy (E a ). Option E. Increasing molecular velocity Incorrect. Increasing molecular velocity is analogous to increasing the temperature of the molecules, which gives more molecules sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy (E a ). Therefore, the answer is C .",
