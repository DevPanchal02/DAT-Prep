Therefore, we can compare trial 1 and trial 3: Trial [A] (M) [B] (M) [C] (M) Rate (M•s -1 ) 1 0.2 0.1 0.05 0.01 3 0.2 0.2 0.05 0.08 STEP 4: Then, we can see that when the concentration of B is doubled, the rate is increased by a factor of 8. This indicates the order of the reaction with respect to B is 3 because in a 3rd order reaction, the rate is proportional to the cube of the concentration of B: STEP 5: Next, we can find the order of the reactant C by comparing the two trials where the concentration of C changes, and the concentration of other reactants do not change. Therefore, we can compare trial 1 and 4: Trial [A] (M) [B] (M) [C] (M) Rate (M•s -1 ) 1 0.2 0.1 0.05 0.01 4 0.2 0.1 0.10 0.01 STEP 6: Then, we can see that when the concentration of C is doubled, the rate remains the same. This indicates that the order of the reaction with respect to C is zero because in a zero-order reaction, the rate does not depend on the concentrations of the reactant: STEP 7: Then, we can calculate for the overall order of the reaction, which is the sum of all the reaction orders: Therefore, the answer is E .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving rate laws , we need to know that the rate law shows how the concentration of certain reactants affects the reaction rate. We also need to know that the rate law for an elementary reaction can be derived from the coefficients of the reactants in the balanced equation. Here is an example of the rate law derived from a reaction A + B ⇢ C + D: k = rate constant , [ A ] and [ B ] = concentration of reactants, m and n = reaction orders STEP 1: First, we can find the order of NO ( g ) by comparing the two trials where the concentration of NO ( g ) changes, and the concentration of O 2( g ) does not change. Therefore, we can compare trial 1 and 3: Trial [NO] (M) [O 2 ] (M) Rate (M•s -1 ) 1 0.010 0.010 2.5 3 0.030 0.010 22.5 STEP 2: Then, we can see that when the concentration of NO ( g ) is tripled, the rate is increased by a factor of 9. This indicates that the order of the reaction with respect to A is 2 because in a second-order reaction, the rate is directly proportional to the square of the concentration of a reactant: STEP 3: Next, we can find the order of O 2( g ) by comparing the two trials where the concentration of O 2( g ) changes, and the concentration of NO ( g ) do not change. Therefore, we can compare trial 1 and 2: Trial [NO] (M) [O 2 ] (M) Rate (M•s -1 ) 1 0.010 0.010 2.5 2 0.010 0.005 1.25 STEP 4: Then, we can see that when the concentration of O 2( g ) is halved, the rate is changed by a factor of 1/2. This indicates the order of the reaction with respect to O 2( g ) is 1 because in a first-order reaction, the rate is directly proportional to the reactant: In this case, the rate law for the reaction is rate = k[NO­­­­­­] 2 [O 2 ].
