      "concept_text": "Option A. Fast reaction rate Correct. A reaction with low activation energy, or a low amount of energy required for a reaction to take place, has a fast reaction rate because there is a lower energy barrier the reaction has to overcome to complete the reaction. Option B. High enthalpy Incorrect. Enthalpy is the total heat of a system that is produced or absorbed by a reaction that focuses on the thermodynamics or the energetics of the reaction. Lowering the activation energy does not affect the total energy produced from the reaction, but only affects the rate of the reaction. This is because enthalpy change is a state function that only depends on the initial and final states of the reaction, not the intermediate steps which involve activation energy. Option C. High entropy Incorrect. Entropy is the disorder of the system that focuses on the thermodynamics or the energetics of the reaction. Lowering the activation energy does not affect the total energy produced from the reaction, but only affects the rate of the reaction. This is because entropy change is a state function that only depends on the initial and final states of the reaction, not the intermediate steps which involve activation energy. Option D. Low activation energy for the reverse reaction Incorrect. A reaction with low activation energy can have a high activation energy for the reverse reaction. For example, in an exothermic reaction where the energy is released, the activation energy, or the “hump” in the reaction coordination diagram can be small, but the reverse reaction can have a large “hump” to overcome. Option E. F ewer transition states Incorrect. Transition states are the highest energy points on the reaction coordinate diagram between two minima along the reaction coordinate. Lowering the activation energy does not change the number of transition states the reaction has. Therefore, the answer is A .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving rate laws from the reaction mechanism , we will need to know that the rate law is determined from the concentrations of the reactants from the rate-determining step or the slow step. We also need to know that the rate law from the reaction mechanism can be derived from the coefficients and reactants used in the rate-determining step. Here is an example of the rate law derived from a slow step of a reaction A + B → C + D: rate = k[A] m [B] n k = rate constant, [A] and [B] = reactant concentrations, m and n = reaction orders (coefficients) From the elementary steps, we could obtain the overall rate of the reaction: Step 1: O 3 + NO 2 → NO 3 + O 2 (slow) Step 2: NO 3 + NO 2 → N 2 O 5 (fast) Overall reaction: O 3 + 2 NO 2 → O 2 + N 2 O 5 The intermediate in this reaction is NO 3 as it is formed during the reaction but is not a part of the reactants or products of the overall reaction. Although the overall chemical reaction can be obtained from the elementary reactions, it is important to recognize that we only want to focus on the slow step of this reaction mechanism to determine the rate law. The overall chemical reaction does not determine the rate law. In this case, we know that the slow step of the reaction is O 3 + NO 2 → NO 3 + O 2 . In an elementary reaction, we can take the coefficients of the reactants and turn them into the exponents. Using the reactants O 3 and NO 2 (which are both 1), the rate law for this reaction can be written as: Rate = k[O 3 ][NO 2 ] Therefore, the answer is C.",

The catalyst in this reaction is NO 2 as it appears as a reactant in the first step but is a product in the second step of a two-step reaction. Although the overall chemical reaction can be obtained from the elementary reactions, it is important to recognize that we only want to focus on the slow step of this reaction mechanism to determine the rate law. The overall chemical reaction does not determine the rate law. In this case, we know that the slow step of the reaction is NO 2 + NO 2 → NO 3 + NO. In an elementary reaction, we can take the coefficients of the reactants and turn them into the exponents.
