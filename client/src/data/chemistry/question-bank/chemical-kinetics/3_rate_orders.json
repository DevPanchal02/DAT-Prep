Option A. Double [A] Incorrect. Since the rate law is rate = k[B] 2 [C], doubling [A] will not change the rate. This is because [A] is not part of the rate law, which means [A] does not impact the rate. Option B. Double [B] Correct. Since the rate law is rate = k[B] 2 [C], doubling [B] will change the rate by a factor of 4 (rate = k[2B] 2 [C] = 4k[B] 2 [C]). Option C. Double [C] Incorrect. Since the rate law is rate = k[B] 2 [C], doubling [C] will change the rate by a factor of 2 (rate = k[B] 2 [2C] = 2k[B] 2 [C]). Option D. Quadruple [A] Incorrect. Since the rate law is rate = k[B] 2 [C], quadrupling [A] will not change the rate. This is because [A] is not part of the rate law, which means [A] does not impact the rate. Option E. Quadruple [B] Incorrect. Since the rate law is rate = k[B] 2 [C], quadrupling [B] will change the rate by a factor of 16 (rate = k[4B] 2 [C] = 16k[B] 2 [C]). Therefore, the answer is B .",

Here is an example of the rate law derived from a reaction A + B ⇢ C + D: k = rate constant , [ A ] and [ B ] = concentration of reactants, m and n = reaction orders In this case, we can see that the given rate law (rate = k[A]2[B]) indicates that the rate is directly proportional to the square of the concentration of A and directly proportional to the concentration of B. Therefore, the correct statement is the rate is directly proportional to the square of the concentration of A. Option A. It is a zero-order reaction Incorrect. In a zero-order reaction, the rate is independent of the concentration of the reactants. However, in the given rate law (rate = k[A] 2 [B]), the rate depends on the concentrations of A and B. Option B. The rate is directly proportional to the square of the concentration of A Correct. The given rate law (rate = k[A] 2 [B]) indicates that the rate is directly proportional to the square of the concentration of A. Option C.
