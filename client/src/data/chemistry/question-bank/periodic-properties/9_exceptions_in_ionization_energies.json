Option A. smaller atomic radii. Incorrect. Alkaline earth metals have larger atomic radii compared to their Group 13 counterparts, so this is not an explanation for their greater ionization energy. Option B. less stable electron configurations. Incorrect. Alkaline earth metals have more stable electron configurations compared to their Group 13 counterparts, so this is not an explanation for their greater ionization energy. Option C. larger atomic radii. Incorrect. Although alkaline earth metals do have larger atomic radii compared to their Group 13 counterparts, this is not an explanation for their greater ionization energy. Option D. more stable electron configurations. Correct. Alkaline earth metals have filled valence orbitals , which gives them a more stable electron configuration compared to their Group 13 counterparts.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving exceptions in ionization energies , we begin by discussing two notable exceptions in ionization energy trends: Note : filled and half-filled valence orbitals are the most stable electron configurations. Since atoms want stable configurations, it is harder to ionize these stable atoms. STEP 1: First, we identify that sodium, magnesium, and aluminum are all period 3 elements. Sodium is an alkali metal, magnesium is an alkaline earth metal , and aluminum is a group 13 element. STEP 2: Next, we identify any important exceptions. Since magnesium is an alkaline earth metal, magnesium has a filled valence orbital , which gives it greater stability, leading to its higher ionization energy compared to aluminum. STEP 3: Therefore, we should expect that aluminum’s ionization energy is less than magnesium’s (735 kJ•mol -1 ), but greater than sodium’s (496 kJ•mol -1 ). In this case, the only option that makes this true is 578 kJ•mol -1 (Option B). Therefore, the answer is B .",

Since atoms want stable configurations, it is harder to ionize these stable atoms. STEP 1: First, we identify that arsenic, selenium, and bromine are all period 4 elements. Arsenic is found in group 15 , selenium is found in group 16 , and bromine is found in group 17. STEP 2: Next, we need to identify important trends that will help us solve this problem. Since arsenic is a group 15 element, arsenic has a half-filled valence orbital . As a result, arsenic has a more stable electron configuration. This explains why arsenic’s ionization energy (947 kJ•mol -1 ) is slightly higher than that of selenium’s (941 kJ•mol -1 ). STEP 3: Finally, let’s compare bromine’s ionization energy to arsenic and selenium. Since ionization energy increases left to right across a period, we should expect bromine’s ionization energy to be slightly higher than selenium’s, but not significantly higher. In this case, the only option that makes this true is 1,140 kJ•mol -1 (Option D). 2,560 kJ•mol -1 (Option E) is too high of an increase in ionization energy and would not be a valid estimation. Therefore, the answer is D .",
