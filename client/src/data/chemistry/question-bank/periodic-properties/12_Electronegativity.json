Electron affinity is the amount of energy released when an electron is added to an atom. Going up a group, the number of energy levels decrease, bringing outer shell electrons closer to the positive nucleus, increasing nuclear attraction, so more energy is released. Option B . Atomic radius Correct. Atomic radius is the measurement of an atom’s size. Going up a group, the number of electron shells surrounding the nucleus decreases, decreasing the atom’s size. Option C. Electronegativity Incorrect. Electronegativity is the measurement of an atom’s ability to attract electrons in a bond. Going up a group, the number of energy levels decrease, bringing bonded electrons closer to the nucleus, increasing the attraction of electrons in a bond. Option D. Ionization energy Incorrect. Ionization energy is the energy needed to remove an electron from an atom or ion. Going up a group, the number of energy levels decrease, bringing outer shell electrons closer to the positive nucleus, increasing nuclear attraction, and making it harder to remove electrons. Option E. Nuclear attraction to valence electrons Incorrect. Going up a group, the number of energy levels decrease, bringing outer shell valence electrons closer to the positive nucleus, increasing nuclear attraction. Therefore, the answer is B .",

Because hydrogen is one period above oxygen, and oxygen is towards the very right of the periodic table, it is difficult to determine which has higher electronegativity. It is helpful to know that the Pauling Scale assigns higher numbers to elements that attract electrons in a bond more strongly. On the Pauling Scale, oxygen’s electronegativity is 3.5 and hydrogen’s is 2.1. This means that oxygen has higher electronegativity . This relationship is one that is difficult to determine using periodic trends, but is important to know. Therefore, the answer is B .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving electronegativity trends , we begin by discussing trends in the periodic table that increase electronegativity (the ability to attract electrons in a bond): STEP 1: First, we identify C is a period 2 element, and Si and P are period 3 elements. STEP 2: Since electronegativity increases up a group, and Si is below C, Si is expected to have an electronegativity less than 2.55. This allows us to eliminate answer choices D and E. STEP 3: Since electronegativity increases from left to right across a period, and Si is to the left of P, Si is expected to have an electronegativity less than 2.19. Our answer is 1.90 (Option A). Therefore, the answer is A .",

STEP 2: Since electronegativity increases moving left to right across a period, the electronegativity of Be is expected to be greater than Li’s (0.98) but less than B’s (2.04). STEP 3: Next, we identify that Be is above Mg in the periodic table. Since electronegativity increases up a group, the electronegativity of Be is expected to be greater than Mg’s (1.31). STEP 4: We conclude that Be’s electronegativity is greater than 1.31 but less than 2.04. Therefore, the answer is D .",
