Option A. number of protons. Incorrect. Elements within an isoelectronic series do not have the same number of protons.

Elements within an isoelectronic series do not have the same atomic radius. Between these isoelectronic atoms, F - is the largest atom since anions have the largest atomic radius, followed by Ne, and finally, Al 3+ since cations have the smallest atomic radius. Option C. number of electrons. Correct. Elements within an isoelectric series have the same number of electrons. F - , Ne, and Al 3+ all have 10 electrons. Option D. effective nuclear charge. Incorrect. Elements within an isoelectric series do not have the same effective nuclear charge. F - , Ne, and Al 3+ have an effective nuclear charge of +7, +8, and +11, respectively.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving isoelectronic series, let’s begin by defining an isoelectronic series as a group of atoms with the same number of electrons but different number of protons. Since all the atoms have the same number of electrons, but different number of protons, the atoms within an isoelectronic series will each have a different overall charge. Keep in mind that we need to find the option that is not an isoelectronic series. Option A. O 2- , F-, Ne, K + , Ca 2+ Correct. O 2- , F-, and Ne each have 10 electrons while K + and Ca 2+ each have 18 electrons, so this is not an isoelectronic series. Option B. Ca 2+ , K + , Ar, Cl - , S 2- Incorrect. Ca 2+ , K + , Ar, Cl - , and S 2- each have 18 electrons, so this is an isoelectronic series. Option C. H - , He, Li + , Be 2+ , B 3+ Incorrect. H - , He, Li + , Be 2+ , and B 3+ each have 2 electrons, so this is an isoelectronic series. Option D. Se 2- , Br-, Kr, Rb + , Sr 2+ Incorrect. Se 2- , Br-, Kr, Rb + , and Sr 2+ each have 36 electrons, so this is an isoelectronic series. Option E. Te 2- , I-, Xe, Cs + , Ba 2+ Incorrect. Te 2- , I-, Xe, Cs + , and Ba 2+ each have 54 electrons, so this is an isoelectronic series. Therefore, the answer is A .",
