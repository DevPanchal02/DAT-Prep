In this case, fluorine and lithium are both period 2 elements, with lithium on the left and fluorine on the right of the period. Recall that moving left to right across a period, electron shielding remains constant but effective nuclear charge increases.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving electron affinity trends , we discuss trends that increase electron affinity, resulting in more energy being released by the addition of an electron. A greater nuclear attraction between an electron and the atom will result in more energy being released. Keep in mind that we need to find the expected electron affinity for Na. STEP 1: First, we identify that Li and Cs are both group 1 elements. Na is also a group 1 element, and is right below Li and farther away from Cs. STEP 2: Since electron affinity increases up a group, we can expect Na to have an electron affinity higher than Cs (-45.5 kJ•mol -1 ) and lower than Li (-59.6 kJ•mol -1 ). STEP 3: As we can see, both -52.9 kJ•mol -1 (Option B) and -46.9 kJ•mol -1 (Option C) are possible choices. However, since Na is right below Li, Na’s electron affinity is closer to -59.6 kJ•mol -1 . In this case, the expected electron affinity for Na is -52.9 kJ•mol -1 . The other answer choice, -46.9 kJ•mol -1 is the electron affinity for Rb, which is a group 1 element that is closer to Cs. Therefore, the answer is B .",

A greater nuclear attraction between an electron and the atom will result in more energy being released. Keep in mind that we need to find the expected electron affinity for aluminum. STEP 1: First, we identify that moving from left to right across period 3, we encounter aluminum, silicon, and then sulfur. STEP 2: Since electron affinity increases moving left to right across a period, it conversely decreases moving right to left across a period. STEP 3: Therefore, we must identify the answer choice with an electron affinity lower than silicon’s 134.1 kJ•mol -1 . The only reasonable answer choice is 41.8 kJ•mol -1 (Option A). Therefore, the answer is A .",
