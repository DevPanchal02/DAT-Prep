      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving effective nuclear charge , let’s begin by discussing the formula for effective nuclear charge: Z eff = Z – S Keep in mind that we need to find the element with the incorrectly matched effective nuclear charge. Option A. Z eff of Al is +3 Incorrect . Aluminum has 13 protons and 10 shielding electrons. Z eff = Z – S = 13 – 10 = +3 Option B . Z eff of P is +5 Incorrect . Phosphorus has 15 protons and 10 shielding electrons. Z eff = Z – S = 15 – 10 = +5 Option C . Z eff of Li is +1 Incorrect . Lithium has 3 protons and 2 shielding electrons. Z eff = Z – S = 3 – 2 = +1 Option D . Z eff of Cl is +9 Correct . Chlorine has 17 protons and 10 shielding electrons. Z eff = Z – S = 17 – 10 = +7. Option E . Z eff of Mg is +2 Incorrect . Magnesium has 12 protons and 10 shielding electrons. Z eff = Z – S = 12 – 10 = +2 Therefore, the answer is D .",
