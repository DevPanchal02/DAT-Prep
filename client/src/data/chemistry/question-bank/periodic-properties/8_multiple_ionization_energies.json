Additionally, removing each subsequent electron further decreases electron-electron repulsions, increasing the proximity of electrons to the positive nucleus, which also contributes to increased nuclear attraction. In this case, we can say that a primary factor responsible for the increasing trend observed in successive ionization energies is the decreasing number of electrons . Option A. Decreasing number of protons Incorrect. The number of protons does not change with successive ionization energies, because only electrons are removed. Option B. Decreasing number of electrons Correct. The decreasing number of electrons reduces the electron-electron repulsions that usually enlarge the size of the electron cloud. This means that the electrons are closer to the nucleus, increasing effective nuclear charge, which explains why successive ionization energies increase. Option C. Decreasing atomic mass Incorrect. Removing electrons makes a negligible difference to the atomic mass, so this is not primarily responsible for why successive ionization energies increase. Option D. Decreasing atomic stability Incorrect. Removing electrons does not necessarily correlate to a decrease in atomic stability, so this is not primarily responsible for why successive ionization energies increase. Option E. Decreasing nuclear charge Incorrect. Removing electrons does not affect nuclear charge, because the proton number is unchanged. However, it does decrease shielding and increase effective nuclear charge, which is the nuclear charge (or pull) felt by electrons. Therefore, the answer is B .",

Then, we identify that Be has 2 valence electrons, B has 3, C has 4, N has 5, and O has 6. STEP 2: Next, since we are looking for the element with the highest third ionization energy, we need to find the element with 2 valence electrons from our options choices. Be (Beryllium) will have stable first and second ionization energies since both electrons are removed from the valence shell. However, the second ionization removes the entire valence electron shell. STEP 3: As a result, the third electron removed will come from a less shielded, inner electron shell, and therefore, there will be a significant “jump” in beryllium’s third ionization energy. In this case, the element expected to have the highest third ionization energy is Be. The other elements do not have their third ionization from an inner electron shell, so the other elements will not have significantly higher third ionization energies. Therefore, the answer is A .

STEP 1: First, we identify that Be (Option E) is found in period 2, Na (Option A) and Mg (Option B) are found in period 3, and K (Option C) and Ca (Option D) are found in period 4. Because ionization energy decreases moving down a group, the ionization energies for K and Ca are expected to be lower than the ionization energies for Na, Mg, and Be. STEP 2: Comparing K and Ca, we infer that K will experience a significant “jump” in its second ionization energy because the first ionization removes the entire valence electron shell. As a result, the second ionization comes from a less shielded, inner electron shell. In contrast, both the first and second ionizations of Ca are removed from the valence shell, so its second ionization energy is relatively stable. In this case, the element with the lowest second ionization energy is Ca . (K’s second ionization energy is 3,052 kJ•mol -1 , Ca’s second ionization energy is 1,145 kJ•mol -1 ).

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving multiple ionization energies , we begin by establishing that the ionization energy (the energy associated with removing an electron) increases with the removal of each successive electron. Once the first electron is removed from the neutral atom, the overall charge of the atom becomes positive , which increases the attractive forces between the ion and its electrons. Additionally, removing each subsequent electron further decreases electron-electron repulsions, increasing the proximity of electrons to the positive nucleus, which also contributes to increased nuclear attraction. A significant “jump” in ionization energy is observed after the outermost electron shell is removed because the successive ionizations remove electrons from less shielded, inner electron shells. Decreased shielding increases nuclear attraction, making it harder to remove electrons. 1st ionization energy 577 kJ•mol -1 2nd ionization energy 1,815 kJ•mol -1 3rd ionization energy 2,740 kJ•mol -1 4th ionization energy 11,600 kJ•mol -1 STEP 1: First, looking at the provided experimental values, we identify that there is a significant “jump” in the fourth ionization energy. STEP 2: Next, we identify that elements with 3 valence electrons will have a significant “jump” in fourth ionization energy. This is because the first, second, and third ionization removes the valence electron shell, so the fourth ionization removes an electron from the less shielded, inner electron shell. STEP 3: Finally, identify the element with 3 valence electrons. From the options, only aluminum (Option C) has 3 valence electrons. Therefore, the answer is C .",

Beryllium has 2 valence electrons, sodium has 1, magnesium has 2, aluminum has 3, and sulfur has 6. This implies that for beryllium, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, and sulfur, we should see a significant “jump” in their 3rd, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 7th ionization energies, respectively. STEP 2: Next, compare the data from the experimental values and see if it aligns with what we would expect. The experimental values reveal that there is no significant jump from the 1st to 4th ionization energies for the given element. Instead, the data increases gradually, implying all four electrons are removed from the same valence shell. STEP 3: Lastly, we need to determine the correct element. For beryllium, sodium, magnesium, and aluminum, we should have seen a significant “jump” in their 3rd, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ionization energies, respectively. However, because no significant jump was seen, this implies that the most likely element being studied is Sulfur . (Option E). Therefore, the answer is E .",

Decreased shielding increases nuclear attraction, making it harder to remove electrons. STEP 1: First, we identify that calcium has 2 valence electrons. Since calcium has 2 valence electrons, the first and second ionization energy would remain relatively stable. STEP 2: Next, we must select the option that is greater than 590 kJ•mol -1 , but not significantly greater. This is because ionization energy increases with each subsequent ionization. However, there is no significant “jump” because the second ionization is removed from the outer electron shell. Looking at our answer choices, the best estimated value for the second ionization energy of calcium from the given values is 1150 kJ•mol -1 . Therefore, the answer is C .
