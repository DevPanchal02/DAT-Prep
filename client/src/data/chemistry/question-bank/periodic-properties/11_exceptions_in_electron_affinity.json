      "concept_text": "Keep in mind that we need to identify the fact that does not directly affect electron affinity. Option A. Atomic radius Incorrect. As atomic radius decreases, the proximity between the nucleus and valence electrons decreases. This results in higher nuclear attraction, and an increase in electron affinity. Option B. Nuclear charge Incorrect. As we move from left to right across a period, the nuclear charge increases. This results in higher nuclear attraction, and an increase in electron affinity. Option C. Electronic stability Incorrect. An increase in electronic stability decreases an atomâ€™s affinity to gain an electron, because the addition of another electron could affect or disrupt its stability. Option D. Atomic mass Correct. There is no direct correlation between atomic mass and electron affinity. Option E. Electron shielding Incorrect. As electron shielding decreases, the proximity between the nucleus and valence electrons decreases. This results in higher nuclear attraction, and an increase in electron affinity. Therefore, the answer is D .",

Keep in mind that we need to identify the statement about electron affinity that its false . Option A. Alkali metals have higher electron affinities than Alkaline earth metals Incorrect. Alkali metals have higher electron affinities than alkaline earth metals because adding an electron completes their s-orbital, giving them a stable electron configuration. Adding an electron to alkaline earth metals, which already have complete s -orbitals, would result in a lower stability. Option B. Noble gases have high electron affinity Correct. Noble gases have complete electron shells, which makes their electron configuration very stable. This is why noble gases have negligible electron affinity. Option C. Electron affinity generally increases up a group Incorrect. Electron affinity generally increases up a group because the number of energy levels decrease, bringing outer shell electrons closer to the nucleus, increasing nuclear attraction. Option D. Halogens have high electron affinity Incorrect. Halogens have high electron affinity because adding an electron completes their p -orbital, giving them a stable electron configuration. Option E. Alkaline earth metals have low electron affinity Incorrect. Alkaline earth metals have low electron affinity because they have complete s -orbitals, so their electron affinities are very low.

STEP 1: First, we can identify that both the elements are period 3 elements. Phosphorus is a group 15 element, while silicon is a group 14 element. STEP 2: Since group 15 elements have half-filled p -orbitals which make them more stable than group 14 elements, phosphorus will have a lower electron affinity than silicon. As we can see, phosphorus has a lower electron affinity when compared to silicon because phosphorus has a more stable electron configuration . Option A. has more electron shielding. Incorrect. Phosphorus and silicon are both period 3 elements, so they all have the same amount of electron shielding. Option B. has a larger atomic radius. Incorrect. Phosphorus is to the right of silicon in the periodic table, and since atomic radius decreases moving left to right across a period, phosphorus has a smaller atomic radius. Option C. has a more stable electron configuration. Correct. Phosphorus is a group 15 element with a half-filled p -orbital, making it more stable than group 14 elements in the same period. Option D. has fewer valence electrons. Incorrect. While phosphorus (group 15) has more valence electrons than silicon (group 14). Option E. has smaller electronegativity. Incorrect. Electronegativity increases moving from left to right across a period. Since phosphorus is to the right of silicon, phosphorus has greater electronegativity. Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving exceptions in electron affinity , we begin by discussing three notable groups that have increased electron stability, which decreases electron affinity. STEP 1: First, we identify that all of the elements are period 3 elements. Moving left to right across period 3, we encounter Si, P, and S, in that order. Since electron affinity increases left to right across a period, their electron affinity rankings from highest to lowest is: Si < P < S STEP 2: Next, we identify that P is a group 15 element, so its electron affinity will be lower than the group 14 element of the same period. Since Si is the group 14 element, our new rankings are: P < Si < S STEP 3: Since Si and S have electron affinities of 134.1 and 200.4 kJâ€¢mol -1 , respectively, and we anticipate P to have an electron affinity that is lower than Si, 72.0 kJâ€¢mol -1 (Option B) is correct. -11.2 kJâ€¢mol -1 (Option A) is not correct because only noble gases and some alkaline earth metals will have electron affinities that are negative in value. Therefore, the answer is B .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving exceptions in electron affinity , we begin by discussing three notable groups that have increased electron stability, which decreases electron affinity. In this case, we know that F is a halogen with a very large positive electron affinity. This implies that a lot of energy is released when an electron is added to F. Meanwhile, Neonâ€™s electron affinity is a negative number. This contrast allows us to conclude that energy is absorbed when an electron is added to Ne . Alternatively, it is intuitive to think that fluorine, which is the element with the highest electronegativity, really wants an extra electron to fulfill its octet. Therefore, a lot of energy is released in this spontaneous process. On the other hand, neon is highly stable and does not want an extra electron to disrupt its filled octet. Therefore, energy must be added in order for this nonspontaneous process to occur. Therefore, energy must be absorbed when an electron is added to Ne. Therefore, the answer is A .",
