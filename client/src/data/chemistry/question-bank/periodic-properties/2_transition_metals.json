      "concept_text": "Keep in mind that we need to identify the statement that is incorrect of inner transition metals. Option A. Elements found in period 6 are classified as lanthanides. Incorrect. Inner transition metals are found in the bottommost section of the periodic table and the elements in period 6 are classified as lanthanides. Option B. Elements found in period 7 are classified as actinides. Incorrect. Inner transition metals are found in the bottommost section of the periodic table and the elements in period 7 are classified as actinides. Option C. They are more abundant on Earth than transition metals. Correct. Inner transition metals are less abundant on earth than transition metals. Option D. Their most prominent oxidation state is +3. Incorrect. Transition metals often exhibit multiple oxidation states, and the most prominent oxidation state is +3. Option E. Their outermost electrons reside in the f-orbital. Incorrect. Successive electrons added to an inner transition element will reside in the outermost f -orbital. Therefore, the answer is C .",
