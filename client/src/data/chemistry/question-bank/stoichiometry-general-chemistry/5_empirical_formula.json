To re-write a molecular formula into an empirical formula, we divide the molecular formula by the subscripts’ largest common factor. Keep in mind that we are looking for the formula that is not an empirical formula. Option A. C 2 H 5 O Incorrect. The subscripts for C­ 2 H 5 O are 2 5, and 1. Since the largest common factor is 1, the empirical formula for C 2 H 5 O is C 2/1 H 5/1 O 1/1 = C 2 H 5 O, so C 2 H 5 O is already an empirical formula. Option B. C 9 H 8 O 4 Incorrect. The subscripts for C 9 H 8 O 4 are 9, 8, and 4. Since the largest common factor is 1, the empirical formula for C 9 H 8 O 4 is C 9/1 H 8/1 O 4/1 = C 9 H 8 O 4 , so C 9 H 8 O 4 is already an empirical formula. Option C. CO 2 Incorrect.

All the possible molecular formulas for CH 4 O 2 must therefore have subscripts that are multiples of the subscripts in CH 4 O 2 . In other words, we should be able to simplify all possible molecular formulas to CH 4 O 2 . Of the answer choices, only C 4 H 16 O 10 (Option D) cannot be simplified to CH 4 O 2 (the ratio of its subscripts does not match those of CH 4 O 2 ), so it is not a possible molecular formula of CH 4 O 2 . To re-write a molecular formula into an empirical formula, we divide the molecular formula by the subscripts’ largest common factor. Keep in mind that we need to find the molecular formula that cannot be simplified to CH 4 O 2 . Option A. CH 4 O 2 . Incorrect. The subscripts for CH 4 O 2 are 1, 4, and 2. Since the largest common factor is 1, the empirical formula for CH 4 O 2 is C 1/1 H 4/1 O 2/1 = CH 4 O 2 , so CH 4 O 2 is a possible molecular formula. Keep in mind that CH 4 O 2 can be both an empirical and molecular formula. Option B. C 2 H 8 O 4 Incorrect. The subscripts for C 2 H 8 O 4 are 2, 8, and 4.

Keep in mind that the empirical formula is the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. To re-write this chemical formula into an empirical formula, we divide the chemical formula by the subscript’s largest common factor. The subscripts of C 2.5 H 3 N 0.5 are 2.5, 3, and 0.5. Since the largest fractional common factor is 0.5, the empirical formula for C 2.5 H 3 N 0.5 is C 2.5/0.5 H 3/0.5 N 0.5/0.5 = C 5 H 6 N . Therefore, the answer is C .",

To do this, we divide the molecular formula by the subscripts’ largest common factor, which is 2. The empirical formula for N 4 H 8 O 2 is N 4/2 H 8/2 O 2/2 = N 2 H 4 O. STEP 2: Next, we need to find the molar mass of N 2 H 4 O. Approximately, N has an atomic mass of 14 amu, H has an atomic mass of 1 amu, and O has an atomic mass of 16 amu. This implies that the molar mass of N 2 H 4 O is (2 × 14) + (4 × 1) + (1 × 16) = 28 + 4 + 16 = 48 g•mol -1 . Therefore, the answer is C .",
