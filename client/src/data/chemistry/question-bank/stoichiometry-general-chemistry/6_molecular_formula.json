The ratio of moles for each element of C 2 H 4 O 2 is 2:4:2, which can be simplified to 1:2:1.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving molecular formulas , we first need to find the number of moles of oxygen and nitrogen in the sample, and then use this to find the grams of nitrogen. STEP 1: First, we find the moles of oxygen in the sample (O = 16 g•mol -1 ): 12 g ÷ 16 g•mol -1 = 0.75 mol of oxygen STEP 2: Based on sample N 2 O 3 , there are 2 moles of nitrogen for every 3 moles of oxygen. Since there are 0.75 moles of oxygen, the number of moles of nitrogen is: 0.75 ÷ 3 × 2 = 0.50 mol of nitrogen STEP 3: Finally, we need to convert 0.50 mol of nitrogen into grams (N = 14 g•mol -1 ): 0.50 mol × 14 g•mol -1 = 7 g of nitrogen Therefore, the answer is A .",
