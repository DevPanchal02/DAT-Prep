      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving limiting reagents , we will need to determine the coefficients , or the number of each molecule that are used to balance the chemical equation . STEP 1: First, we will determine the coefficients of C and A. Let “X” represent the mole ratio between C and A: By rearranging the equation to isolate “X”, we get: For every 3 moles of A consumed, there are 4 moles of C produced. Therefore, the coefficient of A is 3 and the coefficient of C is 4 within the balanced equation. STEP 2: Next, we will determine the coefficient of B. To do so, we first need to determine how many moles of B are needed to completely react 1.8 moles of A, keeping in mind that when 1.8 moles of B are initially reacted, 0.6 moles of B are left unreacted: By rearranging the equation, we get: We determine that 1.2 moles of B are needed to react completely with 1.8 moles of A. STEP 3: Now let’s determine the coefficient of B. Since 1.8 moles of A and 1.2 moles of B are used up during the reaction, and 2.4 moles of C are produced, we can write the following equation: Now, to find the balanced equation, we divide each coefficient by the largest common factor, which is 0.6: STEP 4: Finally, let’s write the balanced equation using the calculated coefficients.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving limiting reagents, we need to determine the maximum moles of H 2 O that can be produced if 0.3 moles of oxygen gas react with 14 grams of ethene. STEP 1 : First, we need to determine if the equation is balanced. Since the equation is not balanced, we begin by balancing the equation. STEP 2: Next, we need to convert all the masses to moles. Since the quantity of oxygen gas is already provided to us in moles, we only need to convert the molar mass of ethene (28 g • mol -1 ) to moles. STEP 3 : Then, we need to determine the moles of O 2 required to completely react with 0.5 moles of C 2 H 4 . If we want to completely react 0.5 moles of ethene, we need 1.5 moles of O₂. Since we need 1.5 moles of O 2 , but we only have 0.3 moles available (as per the initial amount provided in the question), O 2 is the limiting reagent. STEP 4 : Since we determined that O 2 is the limiting reagent, we will use O 2 to determine how much H 2 O we can produce. STEP 5 : Finally, we convert the moles of H 2 O from step 4 to grams. In this case, 3.6 grams of H 2 O can be produced. Therefore, the answer is B . Note: Multiplying an amount by 0.2 is the same as dividing by 5. We can estimate the value of 18 ÷ 5 to be approximately 3.6 because we know that 20 ÷ 5 = 4 and 15 ÷ 5 = 3. So, the value of 18 ÷ 5 will fall between 4 and 3.",
