When balancing equations, it is often easier to start by balancing the elements that appear in the least number of compounds. STEP 1: First, we identify each element and its quantity for both reactants and products. There is 1 N, 3 H, and 2 O on the reactants side, and 2 N, 2 O, and 2 H on the products side. __NH 3 + __O 2 → __N 2 O + __H 2 O STEP 2: Next, we will balance the nitrogen. Since there are 2 N on the product side, let’s add a 2 in front of NH 3 to balance the nitrogen: 2 NH 3 + O 2 → N 2 O + H 2 O STEP 3: Now let’s balance the hydrogen. There are 6 H on the reactant side and 2 H on the product side, so let’s add a 3 in front of H 2 O to balance hydrogen: 2 NH 3 + O 2 → N 2 O + 3 H 2 O STEP 4: Finally, let’s balance the oxygen. There are 2 O on the reactant side and now 4 O on the product side, so let’s add a 2 in front of O 2 to balance oxygen: 2 NH 3 + 2 O 2 → N 2 O + 3 H 2 O STEP 5: We did not add anything in front of N 2 O, so the coefficient is 1 and the balanced reaction is: 2 NH 3 + 2 O 2 → 1 N 2 O + 3 H 2 O Therefore, the answer is D.",

Since there are 4 P on the reactant side, let’s add a 2 in front of P 2 O 5 to balance the phosphorus: KClO 3 + P 4 → KCl + 2 P 2 O 5 STEP 3: Now let’s balance the oxygen. There are 3 O on the reactant side and 10 O on the product side, so let’s add a 10 in front of KClO 3 and change the coefficient in front of P 2 O 5 to a 6 , so there are 30 O on both sides: 10 KClO 3 + P 4 → KCl + 6 P 2 O 5 STEP 4: Now, let’s balance the potassium and chlorine. There are 10 K and 10 Cl on the reactant side, so let’s add a 10 in front of KCl to balance both of them: 10 KClO 3 + P 4 → 10 KCl + 6 P 2 O 5 STEP 5: Finally, we must double check the phosphorus, as coefficients can sometimes change during the process of balancing. We must add a 3 in front of P 4 so that there are 12 P on both sides of the reaction. The balanced reaction is: 10 KClO 3 + 3 P 4 → 10 KCl + 6 P 2 O 5 Therefore, the answer is C.

There are 2 O on the reactant side and 5 O total on the product side, so we will need to balance the equation by adding a 5 to O₂, a 2 in front of H 2 O, and changing the coefficient in front of CO 2 to a 4 , so that there are 10 O on both sides: C 2 H 2 + 5 O 2 → 4 CO 2 + 2 H 2 O STEP 4: Finally, let’s balance the carbon by adding a 2 in front of C 2 H 2 : 2 C 2 H 2 + 5 O 2 → 4 CO 2 + 2 H 2 O STEP 5: To answer the question regarding the coefficient c in front of the CO₂ term, we can refer to our newly balanced equation and see that the answer is 4 .

Since there are 5 C on the reactant side, let’s add a 5 in front of CO 2 to balance the carbon: C 5 H 12 + O 2 → 5 CO 2 + H 2 O STEP 3: Now let’s balance the hydrogen. There are 12 H on the reactant side and 2 H on the product side, so let’s add a 6 in front of H 2 O to balance hydrogen: C 5 H 12 + O 2 → 5 CO 2 + 6 H 2 O STEP 4: Finally, let’s balance the oxygen. There are 2 O on the reactant side and 16 O on the product side, so let’s add an 8 in front of O 2 to balance oxygen: C 5 H 12 + 8 O 2 → 5 CO 2 + 6 H 2 O Therefore, the answer is B.",

There is 1 Fe, 2 S, and 2 O on the reactants side, and 2 Fe, 1 S, and 5 O on the products side. FeS 2 + O 2 → Fe 2 O 3 + SO 2 STEP 2: Next, we will balance the iron. Since there are 2 Fe on the product side, let’s add a 2 in front of FeS 2 to balance the iron: 2 FeS 2 + O 2 → Fe 2 O 3 + SO 2 STEP 3: Now let’s balance the sulfur. There are 4 S on the reactant side, so let’s add a 4 in front of SO 2 to balance sulfur: 2 FeS 2 + O 2 → Fe 2 O 3 + 4 SO 2 STEP 4: Now, we can consider the oxygen. There are 2 O on the reactant side and 11 O on the product side, so we must add coefficients so that it multiplies out to a total of 22 O on each side. We can do this by adding an 11 in front of O 2 , a 2 in front of Fe 2 O 3 , and changing the coefficient in front of SO 2 to an 8 . 2 FeS 2 + 11 O 2 → 2 Fe 2 O 3 + 8 SO 2 STEP 5: Finally, we have to go back and check the Fe and the S. We can balance both by changing the coefficient in front of FeS 2 to a 4 : 4 FeS 2 + 11 O 2 → 2 Fe 2 O 3 + 8 SO 2 STEP 6: Now that the equation is balanced, we can begin our molar mass calculations using our coefficients: Therefore, the answer is C .",
