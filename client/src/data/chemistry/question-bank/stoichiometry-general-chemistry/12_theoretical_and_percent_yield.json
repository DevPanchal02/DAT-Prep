This has no real meaning or function in general chemistry. Option C. The maximum amount of product you can expect to obtain from a chemical reaction Correct. This is the correct definition for theoretical yield . Option D. The reactant that determines how much product is formed Incorrect. This is the definition for a limiting reagent . Option E. The ratio of the experimental yield to the theoretical yield, expressed as a percentage Incorrect. This is the definition for percent yield .

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving theoretical and percent yield , we will need to first use our density formula to determine the mass of ethanol, which can then be used to calculate the theoretical mass of ether and ultimately our percent yield of ether. STEP 1: First, we must make sure our reaction is balanced, which it is: STEP 2: Next, we must use the density formula to convert liters of ethanol into grams of ethanol: STEP 3: Now, we can convert mass (g) of ethanol into moles (mol) ethanol: STEP 4 : Next, we can convert moles of ethanol to moles of ether. STEP 5: Subsequently, moles (mol) of ether can be converted into mass (g) of ether by multiplying by the molar mass of ether: STEP 6: Now that we have our mass of ether (theoretical yield), we can find the mass of ether isolated from the reaction (experimental yield) using our density formula once again: 10 STEP 7: Finally, we can plug in our experimental (210 g) and theoretical yield (600 g) values into the percent yield formula: Therefore, the answer is C .",
