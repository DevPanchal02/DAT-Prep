STEP 2: Next, we eliminate answer choice C (35 g Cl 2 ) and D (70 g Cl 2 ), because answer choice E (142 g Cl 2 ) is greater in quantity and will produce more FeCl 3 . STEP 3: 56 g of Fe (56 g•mol -1 ) is 1 mole of Fe. Since the balanced equation tells us that 1 mole of Fe produces 1 mole of FeCl 3 , we know that 56 g of Fe produces 1 mole of FeCl 3 . STEP 4: 142 g of Cl 2 (71 g•mol -1 ) is 2 moles of Cl 2 . Since the balanced equation tells us that 3 moles of Cl 2 produces 2 moles of FeCl 3 , we know that 142 g of Cl 2 produces 1.33 moles of FeCl 3 .

      "concept_text": "Keep in mind we need to find the incorrect pairing between reagent and product quantities. Option A. 46 g C 2 H 5 OH, 88 g CO 2 Incorrect. 46 g of C 2 H 5 OH is 1 mole of C 2 H 5 OH, which produces 2 moles of CO 2 , which has a mass of 2 × 44 = 88 g. Option B. 46 g C 2 H 5 OH, 54 g H 2 O Incorrect. 46 g of C 2 H 5 OH is 1 mole of C 2 H 5 OH, which produces 3 moles of H 2 O, which has a mass of 3 × 18 = 54 g. Option C. 96 g O 2 , 88 g CO 2 Incorrect. 96 g of O 2 is 3 moles of O 2 , which produces 2 moles of CO 2 , which has a mass of 2 × 44 = 88 g. Option D. 32 O 2 , 18 g H 2 O Incorrect. 32 g of O 2 is 1 mole of O 2 , which produces 1 mole of H 2 O, which has a mass of 18 g. Option E. 64 g O 2 , 40 g H 2 O Correct. 64 g of O 2 is 2 moles of O 2 , which produces 2 moles of H 2 O, which has a mass of 2 × 18 = 36 g, not 40 g H 2 O. Therefore, the answer is E .",

This implies that 10 moles of Fe will produce 10 moles of FeCl 2 . STEP 4: Finally, we calculate the mass of 10 moles of FeCl 2 using its molar mass of 127 g•mol -1 : Therefore, the answer is E .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving calculations from balanced equations , we will need to first balance our given equation, then calculate the moles of CO 2 produced, and then determine the moles and mass of I 2 O 5 required. STEP 1: First, we need to balance our given equation: I 2 O 5 + CO à CO 2 + I 2 To balance the equation to have the same number of O on both sides, we multiply the coefficients of CO and CO 2 by 5: I 2 O 5 + 5 CO à 5 CO 2 + I 2 We now have 2 I, 10 O, and 5 C on both sides of the equation, making it balanced. STEP 2: Given a molar mass of 44 g•mol -1 , 22 g of CO 2 represents 0.5 moles of CO 2 . STEP 3: Based on the newly balanced equation, producing 5 moles of CO 2 requires 1 mole of I 2 O 5 . Therefore, producing 0.5 moles of CO 2 requires 0.1 moles of I 2 O 5 . STEP 4: Given a molar mass of 334 g•mol -1 , 0.1 moles of I 2 O 5 represents 33.4 g . Therefore, the answer is A .",
