      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving percent compositions , all we need to do is to divide the molecular mass of sodium in NaCN by the molecular mass of the entire compound. STEP 1: First, we calculate the molecular mass of sodium (Na = 23 g•mol -1 ): 1 × 23 g•mol -1 STEP 2: Next, we find the molecular mass of NaCN (Na = 23, C = 12, N = 14 g•mol -1 ): 23 + 12 + 14 = 49 g•mol -1 STEP 3: Finally, we calculate 23 ÷  49 to find the percent by mass of sodium in NaCN. Without doing any calculations, we can tell that the result is a number that is slightly less than one-half. As we can see, the only answer choice that fits this requirement is 47% . Therefore, the answer is A .",

STEP 1: First, we find the molecular mass of C 8 H 9 NO 2 (C = 12, H = 9, N = 14, O = 16 g•mol -1 ): (8 × 12) + (9 × 1) + 14 + (2 × 16) = 96 + 9 + 14 + 32 = 151 g•mol -1 STEP 2: Next, we calculate the number of moles in 75 g of C 8 H 9 NO 2 (151 g•mol -1 ): moles = 75 g ÷ 151 g•mol -1 = 0.5 mol of C 8 H 9 NO 2 STEP 3: Finally, we calculate the number of moles of hydrogen found in 0.5 mol of C 8 H 9 NO 2 . Since there are 9 moles of hydrogen for every mole of C 8 H 9 NO 2 , 0.5 moles of C 8 H 9 NO 2 has: 0.5 × 9 = 4.5 moles of hydrogen Therefore, the answer is C .",
