Option A. NaCl Incorrect. An Arrhenius base needs to be able to produce OH - ions in solution. NaCl does not contain any OH - ions, therefore it cannot act as an Arrhenius base. Option B. NH 3 Incorrect. An Arrhenius base needs to be able to produce OH - ions in solution. NH 3 does not contain any OH - ions, therefore it cannot act as an Arrhenius base. It can, however, act as a Lewis base by donating a pair of electrons. Option C. CaCO 3 Incorrect.

An Arrhenius base needs to be able to produce OH - ions in solution. Mg(OH) 2 contains OH - ions that can dissociate into OH - in water, therefore it can act as an Arrhenius base. Option E.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving acids and bases, we will need to review what acids and bases are. In this case, combining the Arrhenius, Bronsted-Lowry, and Lewis definitions of acids and bases, we know that: In this case, in the reaction (NO2 - (aq) + H 2 O ( l ) ⇌ HNO 2(aq) + OH - (aq) ), we can see that the H 2 O has donated an H + ion to NO 2 - , resulting in the production of HNO 2 . Therefore H 2 O is acting as an acid in this reaction. Option A. 2 Na (aq) + 2 H 2 O (l) ⇌ H 2(g) + 2 NaOH (aq) Incorrect. In this equation, we can see that the H 2 O has dissociated into H and OH - , and the OH - has combined with Na to form NaOH. H 2 O is not acting as an acid in this case since it is not acting as an H + producer, an H + donor, nor an electron pair acceptor. Option B. NO 2 - (aq) + H 2 O(l) ⇌ HNO 2(aq) + OH - (aq) Correct. In this equation, we can see that the H 2 O has donated an H + ion to NO 2 - , resulting in the production of HNO 2 . Therefore, H 2 O is acting as an acid in this reaction. Option C. 2 H 2(g) + O2 (g) ⇌ 2 H 2 O (l) Incorrect. In this equation, we can see that the H 2 has combined with O 2 to form H 2 O. H 2 O is not acting as an acid in this case since it is not acting as an H+ producer, an H + donor, nor an electron pair acceptor. Option D. CH 3 COOH (aq) + H 2 O (l) ⇌ H 3 O+ (aq) + CH 3 COO - (aq) Incorrect. In this equation, we can see that the H 2 O has accepted an H + ion from CH 3 COOH, resulting in the production of H 3 O + . Therefore, H 2 O is acting as a base in this reaction. Option E. H 2 O (l) + H 3 PO 4(aq) ⇌ H 3 O+ (aq) + H 2 PO 4 - (aq) Incorrect. In this equation, we can see that the H 2 O has accepted an H + ion from H 3 PO 4 , resulting in the production of H 3 O + . Therefore, H 2 O is acting as a base in this reaction. Therefore, the answer is B .",
