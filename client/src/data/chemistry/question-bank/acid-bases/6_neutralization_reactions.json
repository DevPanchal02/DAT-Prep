      "concept_text": "Option A. NaCl Incorrect. To determine if NaCl salt is acidic, basic, or neutral, we can first break down the molecule into its respective ions (NaCl à Na + + Cl - ). Then, we will add H + to the negative ion (add H + to Cl - à HCl), and we will add OH - to the positive ion (add OH - to Na + à NaOH). Given that HCl is a strong acid and NaOH is a strong base, and a strong acid and strong base form a neutral salt, NaCl is confirmed as a neutral salt. Therefore, NaCl will create a neutral solution. Option B. HCl Incorrect. HCl is not a salt but a strong acid. Option C. CH 3 COONa Correct. To determine if CH 3 COONa salt is acidic, basic, or neutral, we can first break down the molecule into its respective ions (CH 3 COONa à CH 3 COO - + Na + ). Then, we will add H + to the negative ion (add H + to CH 3 COO - à CH 3 COOH) and we will add OH - to the positive ion (add OH - to Na + à NaOH). Given that CH 3 COOH is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, CH 3 COONa is a basic salt. Therefore, CH 3 COONa will create a basic solution. Option D. H 2 SO 4 Incorrect. H 2 SO 4 is not a salt but a strong acid. Option E. KI Incorrect. To determine if KI salt is acidic, basic, or neutral, we can first break down the molecule into its respective ions (KI à K + + I - ). Then, we will add H + to the negative ion (add H + to I - à HI), and we will add OH - to the positive ion (add OH - to K + à KOH). Given that HI is a strong acid and KOH is a strong base, KI is a neutral salt. Therefore, KI will create a neutral solution. Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving neutralization reactions , we need to know that neutralization is a reaction when a strong acid reacts quantitatively with a strong base to form salt and water. In this case, when calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2 ) is mixed with hydrochloric acid (HCl), a neutralization reaction occurs. The hydroxide ions (OH - ) from calcium hydroxide combine with the hydrogen ions (H + ) from hydrochloric acid to produce water (H 2 O). The chemical reaction between Ca(OH) 2 and HCl can be written as the following: Ca(OH) 2( s ) + 2 HCl ( aq ) à CaCl 2( aq ) + 2 H 2 O ( l ) Therefore, the salt produced when Ca(OH) 2 is mixed with HCl is CaCl 2 .

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving neutralization reaction, we need to know that the reaction in the given question is a neutralization reaction. In this case, we can use the following formula, which can only be used when there is a neutralization reaction between a strong acid and a strong base: M = molarity, V = volume, M 1 V 1 = moles of acid, M 2 V 2 = moles of base STEP 1: First, we need to come up with a chemical reaction between HCl and Ca(OH) 2 : 2 HCl ( aq ) + Ca(OH) 2( aq ) à CaCl 2( aq ) + 2 H 2 O ( l ) STEP 2: Then, we can calculate for the moles of HCl needed to neutralize 20 mL of 2.0 M of Ca(OH) 2 , knowing that the volume of the base Ca(OH) 2 is 20 × 10 -3 L ( V 2 = 20 × 10 -3 ) and the concentration of the base Ca(OH) 2 is 2.0 M ( M 2 = 2.0). Also, we should know that the base Ca(OH) 2 dissociates to produce 2 OH - ions, so we have to add a coefficient of 2 to the right side of the equation: STEP 3: Then, we can calculate for the number of HCl molecules needed by using the Avogadro’s number: Therefore, the answer is D .",

In this case, the acid would be H 2 SO 4 because it is a strong acid that dissociates to produce 2 H + ions. The rest of the options are not correct because CH 3 COOH is a weak acid, KOH is a strong base, HCl dissociates to produce 1 H + ion, and HNO 3 dissociates to produce 1 H + ion. Therefore, the answer is B .",
