To judge the stability of conjugate bases, we can consider their size. A larger conjugate base can disperse negative charge more effectively, making it more stable. In this case, we are given the pK a values of HF and HCl. Since Br is lower than both F and Cl in the periodic table, Br is larger in size, which means that Br - can disperse a negative charge more effectively, making it more stable. Therefore, HBr is considered a stronger acid in comparison to HF and HCl. Recall that a lower pK a indicates a stronger acid. Therefore, the pK a value of HBr must be lower than both HF (pK a = 3.2) and HCl (pK a = -7). Therefore, the only possible pK a value for HBr is -9. Therefore, the answer is A .",

For oxoacids that contain the same number of oxygen atoms (4 in this case), the strength of the acid will increase with the electronegativity of the central atom. This is because a more electronegative central atom is better at stabilizing a negative charge. In this case, we know that the central atoms are chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I), and their electronegativities follow the trend Cl > Br > I. Therefore, the order of acid strength is consistent with this trend, making HClO 4 the strongest, followed by HBrO 4 , and then HIO 4 . Therefore, HClO 4 > HBrO 4 > HIO 4 .

      "concept_text": "Incorrect. As we move down the group, the atomic radius generally increases. Fluorine has a smaller radius than chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Option B. Fluoride ions are more stable than chloride, bromide, or iodide ions Incorrect. Due to the size of the fluoride ion, it is not able to distribute negative charge as well as the other halides, thus making it less stable. Although F is more electronegative than Cl, Br, or I, the size of the ions takes precedent and is our primary consideration. This is because a larger conjugate base can disperse negative charge more effectively, making it more stable. Option C. Fluorine has greater ionization energy than chlorine, bromine, or iodine Incorrect. Ionization energy is not the primary factor in determining acidity. Option D. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, bromine, or iodine Incorrect. Although the statement is true, it does not fully explain why HF is a weaker acid than HCl, HBr, and HI. In this case, the size of a conjugate base is a primary factor that determines acidity. A larger conjugate base can disperse negative charge more effectively, making it more stable. On the other hand, when comparing the conjugate bases of oxoacids, the electronegativity of the central atom determines the stability. Option E. Fluorine has the fewest number of electron shells Correct. Acid strength is based on the ability of their conjugate bases to remain stable in solution. This is mainly based on how well the conjugate base ion can distribute its negative charge across itself. Usually, larger ions have better charge distribution capabilities, and since fluoride ions are smaller than other halide ions (fewer valence shells), they are less stable in solution, thus making their conjugate acids weak. Therefore, the answer is E .",

Therefore, H 2 ClO 4 is more acidic than H 2 BrO 4 because Cl is more electronegative than Br. Option D. H 2 ClO 4 has a lower pK a value than H 2 IO 4 Correct. For oxoacids with the same number of oxygen atoms, acid strength increases with the electronegativity of the central atom. A central atom with higher electronegativity will exhibit greater stability in retaining the negative charge after the acid releases a proton. H 2 ClO 4 has lower pK a value than H 2 IO 4 because Cl is more electronegative than I. Option E. H 2 SO 3 has a higher K a value than H 2 SO 4 Incorrect. A high K a value indicates a stronger acid. In this case, H 2 SO 4 has a higher K a value than H 2 SO 3 because H 2 SO 4 is more acidic than H 2 SO 3 . Therefore, the answer is D .",

Strong bases have a low K b value Incorrect. Strong bases have a high K b value because they dissociate almost completely in water, leading to a high concentration of hydroxide ions. Recall that a high K b value corresponds to a low pK b value. Option C. Weak bases have a high pK b value Correct. Weak bases have a high pK b value because they dissociate partially in water. Option D. Strong bases partially dissociate in water Incorrect. Strong bases dissociate almost completely in water. Option E. Ca(OH) 2 is a weak acid Incorrect. Ca(OH) 2 is a strong base because it dissociates completely in water, releasing a high concentration of hydroxide ions. Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "Keep in mind that we are looking for the compound incorrectly matched with their behavior. Option A. HF – weak acid Incorrect. HF is a weak acid because it partially dissociates in water, releasing a relatively small concentration of hydrogen ions. Option B. LiCl – neutral salt Incorrect. To check if LiCl is a neutral salt, we can first break down the molecule into its respective ions (LiCl à Li + + Cl - ). Then we will add H to the negative ion (Add H to Cl - à HCl), and we will add OH to the positive ion (Add OH to Li + à LiOH). Also, a neutral salt is made from neutralizing a strong acid and a strong base. Given that HCl is a strong acid and LiOH is a strong base, LiCl is confirmed as a neutral salt. Option C. NH 3 – weak base Incorrect. NH 3 is a weak base because it undergoes partial ionization in water, releasing a limited concentration of hydroxide ions through NH 3 + H 2 O ⇌ NH 4 + + OH - . Option D. HClO 3 – strong acid Incorrect. HClO 3 is a strong acid because it undergoes complete dissociation in water, producing a high concentration of hydrogen ions through HClO 3 à H + + ClO 3 - . Option E. Ca(OH) 2 – weak base Correct. Ca(OH) 2 is a strong base because Ca(OH) 2 dissociates completely in water through Ca(OH) 2 à Ca 2+ + 2 OH - . Therefore, the answer is E .",
