Let’s pretend that the pH of the initial solution was 4. If the pH increased by 2, the new pH would be 6. If we plug these pH values into the H + ion concentration formula, the initial solution with a pH of 4 would have an H + ion concentration of 10 -4 , while the new pH of 6 would have an H + ion concentration of 10 -6 . When we divide 10 -6 by 10 -4 , we get 10 -2 , which represents a decrease in H + ion by 100 times. In this case, if the pH of a solution increases by 2, its H + ion concentration will decrease by a factor of 100. Therefore, the answer is E .",

If the pOH of a solution is less than 7, this implies that the pH of the solution will be greater than 7, which indicates that the solution has more OH - ions, compared to H + ions. Option C.

If the pOH of a solution is less than 7, according to the pOH formula (pOH = -log[OH - ]), its OH - concentration should be greater than 10 -7 M.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving pH and pOH , we will need to know the pH and pOH formula: pH = -log[H + ] pOH = -log[OH - ] STEP 1: First, we will represent the concentration of OH - in terms of H + by multiplying the concentration of H + by 100. [OH - ] = [H + ](100) STEP 2: Next, we will plug in the OH - concentration as represented in Step 1 into the pOH formula. pOH = -log(OH - ) pOH = -log([H + ](100)) pOH = -[log([H + ]) + log(100)] pOH = -log[H + ] – log(100) STEP 3: Finally, we will simplify the equation from Step 2 by substituting pH for -log[H + ] and solving log(100). We can also represent the equation in terms of pH. pOH = pH – 2 pH = pOH + 2 In this case, the pH of the solution will be greater than the pOH by 2 . Therefore, the answer is E .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving pH and pOH , we will need to know the reaction for the self-ionization of water: H 2 O + H 2 O ⇌ H 3 O + + OH - At room temperature (25°C), we know that the sum of pH and pOH will equal 14. However, this question states that the process occurs at 350 K (76°C), which is much higher than room temperature. Since we know that the reaction is an endothermic process, heat is required for the reaction to proceed. Therefore, heat can be added to the reactant side: Heat + H 2 O + H 2 O ⇌ H 3 O + + OH - At higher temperatures, such as 350 K, the equilibrium will favor the product side, creating more hydronium and hydroxide ions. Knowing that pH and pOH are the -log of H + and OH - concentrations, respectively, an increase in H 3 O + and OH - concentrations will lead to a decrease in both pH and pOH values. As a result, their sum will also be less than 14. In this case, both pH and pOH will decrease and give a sum that is less than 14 . Therefore, the answer is A .",
