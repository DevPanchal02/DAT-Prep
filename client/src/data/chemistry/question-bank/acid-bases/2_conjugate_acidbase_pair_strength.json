H 2 CO 3 and CO 3 2- Correct. A conjugate acid is a base with one more H + ion and a conjugate base is an acid with one less H + ion. Since H 2 CO 3 and CO 3 2- differ by 2 H + ions, they are not a conjugate acid/base pair. Instead, H 2 CO 3 and HCO 3 - can be conjugate acid/base pairs, and so can HCO 3 - and CO 3 2- , but not H 2 CO 3 and CO 3 2- . Option D. HNO 3 and NO 3 - Incorrect.

Meanwhile, the weaker the acid, the stronger its conjugate base. The same can be said about bases and their conjugate acids too. In this case, we are given a list of molecules with various pK b values. To find the substance with the weakest conjugate acid, we must remember that the weaker the conjugate acid, the stronger the base. Therefore, the substance with the weakest conjugate acid will be the substance that is the strongest base. Since strong bases have high K b values, which corresponds to low pK b values, the substance with the weakest conjugate acid is the one with the lowest pK b value. As we can see, Ethylamine (pK b = 3.25) has the lowest pK b value, which means it will have the weakest conjugate acid. Therefore, the answer is A .",

Name Chemical Formula K b Ammonia NH 3 1.8 × 10 -5 Aniline C 6 H 5 NH 2 4.3 × 10 -10 Ethylamine C 2 H 5 NH 2 5.6 × 10 -4 Pyridine C 5 H 5 N 1.8 × 10 -9 Hydroxylamine NH 2 OH 1.1 × 10 -8 In this case, we are given a list of organic compounds with their listed base dissociation constants (K b ). The option choices we are given are each of the five organic compounds’ corresponding conjugate acids (there is an additional H + for each option choice). To find the strongest acid , remember that the stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base. In addition, the weaker the base, the lower its K b value. Therefore, to find the strongest acid ¸ we need to look for the corresponding organic compound with the lowest K b value. Since aniline (C 6 H 5 NH 2 ) has the lowest K b at 4.3 × 10 -10 , its conjugate acid C 6 H 5 NH 3 + will be the strongest acid. Therefore, the answer is B .",

The same can be said about bases and their conjugate acids too. # pK a 1 44.0 2 9.8 3 35.2 In this case, we are given the three substances with their respective pK a values. We need to arrange the substances based on the strength of their conjugate bases. STEP 1: First, we list our substances from greatest to least pK a value: 1 > 3 > 2 STEP 2: Since the lower the pK a , the stronger the acid, we can now re-order our substances from greatest to weakest acid strength (1 had the highest pK a , so it is the weakest acid) 2 > 3 > 1 STEP 3: Finally, we know that a strong acid has a corresponding weak conjugate base. Therefore, we can now re-order our substances from greatest to weakest conjugate base strength (1 was the weakest acid, so it has the strongest conjugate base): 1 > 3 > 2 Therefore, the answer is A .",
