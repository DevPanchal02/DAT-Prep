      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving dissociation constants , we will need to know the base dissociation constant (K b ) formula: The K b value is a measurement that describes a base’s extent of dissociation and strength. Based on the K b formula above, a greater K b value indicates a greater product-to-reactant concentration ratio. Therefore, a higher K b is indicative of a well-dissociated base that produces high quantities of OH - in solution, making it a strong base. In this case, if a base has a high K b value, the base is strong, and it dissociates significantly . Therefore, the answer is D .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving dissociation constants , we will need to know the K a formula: Based on the K a formula above, a greater K a value indicates a larger product-to-reactant concentration ratio. Therefore, a higher K a is indicative of a well-dissociated acid that produces high quantities of H 3 O + in solution, making it a strong acid. We will also need to know the pK a formula, which is another value that indicates the strength of a particular acid in solution. The acid with the greater K a value, which corresponds to a smaller pK a , is the stronger acid: Option A. CH 3 COOH with a K a of 1.8 x 10 -5 Incorrect. A K a of 1.8 × 10 -5 is not the greatest K a value out of the given options. Option B. HF with a pK a of 3.1 Correct. A pK a of 3.1 will give a K a value of 10 -3.1 . Therefore, HF has the greatest K a value and is the strongest acid out of the given options. Option C. HCN with a K a of 6.3 x 10 -10 Incorrect. A K a of 6.3 × 10 -10 is not the greatest K a value out of the given options. Option D. HClO with a pK a of 7.5 Incorrect. A pK a of 7.5 will give a K a value of 10 -7.5 . This is not the greatest K a value out of the given options. Option E. HNO 2 with a K a of 4.5 x 10 -4 Incorrect. A K a of 4.5 × 10 -4 is not the greatest K a value out of the given options. Therefore, the answer is B .",
