      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving ionic compounds , we first need to identify that KNO 3 is an ionic compound. KNO 3 is composed of its component cations (K + ) and anions (NO 3 â ) which are ionically bonded together when K donates an electron to NO 3 . Having established that KNO 3 is an ionic compound, letâs review the properties of ionic compounds: In this case, each of the answer choices are properties of ionic compounds except for âionic compounds are insoluble in water â (Option C). Just to double check, according to the solubility rules, nitrates (NO 3 â ) and potassium (K + ) are both soluble, so KNO 3 is soluble in water. Therefore, the answer is C .",
