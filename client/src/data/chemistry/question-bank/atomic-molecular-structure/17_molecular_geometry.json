      "concept_text": "Keep in mind that we need to find the molecule that is not correctly matched with its respective molecular geometry. Option A. CO 2 - linear Incorrect. There are 4 + 2(6) = 16 valence electrons in CO 2 , which allows us to draw the Lewis structure for the molecule with 2 double bonds on the C. There are a total of 2 electron groups, which correspond to a linear molecular geometry: Option B. SO 4 2- - tetrahedral Incorrect. There are 6 + 4(6) + 2 = 32 valence electrons in SO 4 2- , which allows us to draw the Lewis structure for the molecule with 4 single bonds on the S. There are a total of 4 electron groups, which correspond to a tetrahedral molecular geometry: Option C. PCl 3 - trigonal planar Correct. There are 5 + 3(7) = 26 valence electrons in PCl 3 , which allows us to draw the Lewis structure for the molecule with 3 single bonds and 1 lone pair on the P. There are a total of 4 electron groups, which correspond to a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry, not a trigonal planar geometry (trigonal planar molecules are flat, trigonal pyramidal molecules are not): Option D. PCl 5 - trigonal bipyramidal Incorrect. There are 5 + 5(7) = 40 valence electrons in PCl 5 , which allows us to draw the Lewis structure for the molecule with 5 single bonds on P. Because there are 5 bonding pairs, this corresponds to a trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry: Option E. SF 6 - octahedral Incorrect. There are 6 + 6(7) = 48 valence electrons in SF 6 , which allows us to draw the Lewis structure for the molecule with 6 single bonds around S. Because there are 6 bonding pairs, this corresponds to an octahedral molecular geometry: Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving molecular geometry , we should recall that the VSEPR theory is a model used to predict 3D molecular geometry based on the number of valence shell electron pairs around a central atom. The theory tells us that electron pairs, which include both bonding pairs and lone pairs, will repel each other and orient themselves as far apart as possible. A tetrahedral molecule has 4 bonding pairs, while a trigonal pyramidal molecular structure has 3 bonding pairs and a lone pair. The smaller bond angles can be most accurately accounted for by the presence of the lone pair of electrons, which exerts a stronger repulsion on the bonding pairs than the bonding pairs exert on each other. In this case, we can say that the smaller bond angles in a trigonal pyramidal structure is because lone pairs have greater electron repulsion . Therefore, the answer is A .",
