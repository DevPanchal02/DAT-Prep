Since the atomic number of fluorine is 9, fluorine has 9 protons. STEP 2 : Next, we can determine the number of electrons using the overall charge. This fluorine atom is electrically neutral since no charge is specified in the atomic notation. As a result, the number of electrons (negative charge) equals the number of protons (positive charge), so this fluorine atom has 9 electrons . STEP 3 : Finally, we can determine the number of neutrons using the formula: mass number = (# of protons) + (# of neutron) Since the mass number (A) of fluorine is 19, we can subtract 9 (i.e., the number of protons) and calculate that this fluorine atom has 10 neutrons.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving atoms , we will need to recall some important terms and definitions: Let’s use nitrogen as an example to explain this concept: Naturally occurring nitrogen exists as two stable isotopes: nitrogen-14 and nitrogen-15. Molecular weight is the sum of the number of neutrons and protons in an atom. Nitrogen-14 has a molecular weight of 14 amu since each atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. Similarly, the molecular weight of nitrogen-15 is 15 amu since each atom has 7 protons and 8 neutrons. In contrast, looking at a periodic table, we see that nitrogen’s atomic weight is given as 14.007 amu. The atomic weight depends on the relative abundance of the isotopes found in nature . The vast majority of naturally occurring nitrogen is nitrogen-14 (99.6%), with the remainder existing as nitrogen-15 (0.3%). Predictably, nitrogen’s atomic weight is heavily skewed towards 14. Therefore, the answer is B . Note : the number of electrons has no effect on either the molecular weight or the atomic weight – this is because the weight of an electron is negligible compared to the weight of a proton or neutron.",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving atomic notation , recall that atomic notation includes the chemical symbol, the mass number, and the atomic number: In this case, we can use the atomic notation of the aluminum ion to determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in each ion. STEP 1 : First, we can determine the number of protons using the atomic number. Since the atomic number of aluminum is 13, each aluminum atom/ion has 13 protons. STEP 2 : Next, we can determine the number of electrons using the overall charge. Since the overall charge is positive, this is a cation. More specifically, an overall charge of 2+ means that there are 2 more protons than electrons. Importantly, the number of protons never changes – only the number of electrons can change to affect the overall charge. As a result, there is a total of 13 – 2 = 11 electrons . STEP 3 : Finally, we can determine the number of neutrons using the formula: mass number = (# of protons) + (# of neutrons) Since the mass number of aluminum is 27, we can subtract 13 (i.e., the number of protons) and calculate that aluminum has 14 neutrons. Therefore, the answer is E .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving atoms , we will need to compare the number of protons to the number of electrons in the new anion to determine the overall charge. STEP 1 : First, find the number of valence electrons in a neutrally charged phosphorus atom. Altogether, each electrically neutral phosphorus atom has a total of 15 protons and 15 electrons. Looking at the periodic table, phosphorus is found in group 15 , meaning that phosphorus has 5 valence electrons (therefore, the remaining 10 electrons are non-valence electrons). STEP 2 : Next, we compare the number of valence electrons in a neutrally charged phosphorus to the “new” phosphorus ion in our question. If we add 2 valence electrons , we will have a total of 7 valence electrons. Therefore, the phosphorus ion will have a total of 15 protons and 17 electrons. STEP 3 : Finally, we can determine the overall charge by comparing the number of protons to the number of electrons. Since the ion has 2 more electrons than protons, it will have an overall 2- charge . Therefore, the answer is D .",
