Gay-Lussac’s law is a gas law, which states that the pressure and temperature of a gas have a direct relationship. Option C. Rutherford Incorrect. Rutherford is credited for the gold foil experiment. The gold foil experiment demonstrated that an atom is composed mostly of open space, apart from a dense, positively charged center (nucleus). Option D . Dalton Correct. Dalton is credited for proposing the atomic theory, which describes the fundamental role of atoms in chemistry. Option E. Darwin Incorrect.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving atoms , let’s briefly review the structure of an atom, which consists of three subatomic particles: protons, electrons, and neutrons. In this case, option B ( electrons are heavier than protons ) incorrectly describes the properties of subatomic particles. Recall that only neutrons and protons are included when calculating the mass of an atom – this is because the weight of the electrons is negligible (the weight of an electron is approximately 1/1836th the weight of a proton). Therefore, the answer is B .",
