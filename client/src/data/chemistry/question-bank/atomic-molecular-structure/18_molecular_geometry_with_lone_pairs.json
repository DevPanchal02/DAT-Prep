      "concept_text": "Keep in mind that we need to find the molecule that meets two criteria: (1) must be bent (2) must have a bond angle > 109.5 o . Option A. CO 2 Incorrect. There are 4 + 2(6) = 16 valence electrons in CO 2 , which allows us to draw the Lewis structure for the molecule with 2 double bonds on the C. This corresponds to a linear molecular geometry, which does not meet our first criteria: Option B. H 2 O Incorrect. There are 2(1) + 6 = 8 valence electrons in H 2 O, which allows us to draw the Lewis structure for the molecule with 4 electron groups: 2 bonds and 2 lone pairs on the O. This corresponds to a bent molecular geometry. Although this meets our first criteria, a molecule with a bent molecular geometry with a total of 4 electron groups has a bond angle that is 104.5 o , which is not > 109.5 o , so does not meet our second criteria: Option C. CH 4 Incorrect. There are 4 + 4(1) = 8 valence electrons in CH 4 , which allows us to draw the Lewis structure for the molecule with 4 single bonds on the C. Because there are 4 bonding pairs, this corresponds to a tetrahedral molecular geometry, which does not meet our first criteria: Option D. CO 3 2- Incorrect. There are 4 + 3(6) + 2 = 24 valence electrons in CO 3 2- , which allows us to draw the Lewis structure for the molecule with 1 double bond and 2 single bonds on the C. This corresponds to a trigonal planar geometry, which does not meet our first criteria: Option E. SO 2 Correct. There are 6 + 2(6) = 18 valence electrons in SO 2 , which allows us to draw the Lewis structure for the molecule with 1 double bond, 1 single bond, and 1 lone pair. This corresponds to a bent molecular geometry. This meets both our criteria, because the molecule is not only bent, but it has a bond angle that is > 109.5 o (the actual bond angle is greater than 109.5 o but a bit smaller than 120 o ): Therefore, the answer is E .",
