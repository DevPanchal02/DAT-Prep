      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving elements and compounds , we need to know the characteristics of elements and compounds: Since elements are composed of only one type of atom, elements are composed of atoms with the same number of protons . For example, elemental carbon is made up of carbon atoms with six protons. On the other hand, because compounds are formed when two or more different types of atoms combine, compounds will consist of atoms with different number of protons . Option A. Elements can exist as diatomic molecules, whereas compounds cannot Incorrect. Elements can exist as diatomic molecules, such as H 2 and Cl 2 , but so can compounds, such as HCl. Option B. Elements are always solids at room temperature, while compounds can exist in various states of matter Incorrect. Both elements and compounds can exist in various states at room temperature, depending on their chemical properties and conditions like pressure. An element such as mercury (Hg) is a metal that is liquid at room temperature. Option C. Elements are composed of atoms with the same number of protons, while compounds consist of atoms with different number of protons Correct. Elements are composed of atoms with the same number of protons. For example, elemental carbon is made up of carbon atoms with six protons. On the other hand, because compounds are formed when two or more different types of atoms combine, compounds will consist of atoms with different number of protons. Option D. Elements are composed of atoms with the same number of neutrons Incorrect. Elements are always composed of atoms that have the same number of protons, but not always the same number of neutrons. This is because there are isotopes of the same element that exist, which have the same number of protons, but different number of neutrons. Option E. Elements form compounds via chemical reactions, but compounds can’t be further broken down into simpler substances Incorrect. Because elements form compounds via chemical reactions, compounds can be further broken down back into their original elements. For example, a compound like H 2 O can be broken down into H 2 and O 2 via electrolysis. Therefore, the answer is C .",

Chemical compounds are substances formed when two or more different types of atoms combine and bond. The elements within a given compound always combine in a fixed ratio (for example, CO 2 will always be composed of 1 C and 2 O atoms). Option B. Compounds are always in their gaseous state at room temperature Incorrect. Compounds can exist in different states of matter at room temperature, depending on their chemical properties and the conditions. Option C. Compounds can be further divided into elements through filtration Incorrect. Compounds cannot be separated into elements through physical processes like filtration because compounds are formed by chemically bonding different elements together. Filtration is a physical process that separates mixtures based on the size of particles. Option D. Compounds consist of a single type of atom chemically bonded together Incorrect. A compound is a substance formed by the chemical combination of two or more elements in fixed proportions. These elements are chemically bonded to each other, resulting in a substance with unique properties that differ from the individual elements. Option E. The same compound can have variable compositions depending on the conditions in which they are formed Incorrect. Compounds are formed by chemical reactions where elements combine in fixed ratios to create new substances with distinct properties. These ratios are determined by the chemic al properties of th e elements involved and are not typically affected by the conditions under which the compounds are formed. Therefore, the answer is A .",

Option A. Physical changes are typically reversible, whereas chemical reactions are usually not easily reversible Correct. Physical changes tend to be reversible, meaning the original substance can often be restored, while chemical reactions are usually not easily reversible – the process of reversing a chemical change is usually more difficult and requires many steps Option B. In physical changes, new substances with different properties are formed, while chemical reactions involve a rearrangement of atoms within the same substances Incorrect. In physical changes, no new substance is created and just involves changes to the physical properties of a matter. Chemical reactions involve a rearrangement of atoms to create new substances. Option C. Both physical changes and chemical reactions always result in the formation of new compounds Incorrect. Physical changes do not result in the formation of new compounds whereas chemical reactions result in the formation of new compounds. Option D. Physical changes are characterized by the release or absorption of energy, while chemical reactions do not involve any energy transfer Incorrect. Physical changes are characterized by the release or absorption of energy, while chemical reactions involve energy transfer through the breaking and forming of bonds. Option E.

The chemical properties and composition of the water molecules remain unchanged. Therefore, a student can physically change water by putting water into a freezer. Option A. passing an electric current through the water. Incorrect. During electrolysis of water, an electric current is passed through water, leading to the breakdown of water molecules (H 2 O) into hydrogen (H 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ) gases. This process involves the formation of new substances with different properties. Therefore, this process is a chemical reaction. Option B. putting the water into a freezer. Correct. When water is placed in a freezer and freezes into ice, this change from a liquid state to a solid state is a physical change because it only affects the physical properties of the substance, such as its shape and state. The chemical properties and composition of the water molecules remain unchanged. Therefore, a student can physically change water by putting water into a freezer. Option C. adding more water. Incorrect. Adding more water to a cup of water doesn't lead to a significant change in physical properties of water or chemical composition of water. Adding more water causes a change in volume, but the composition and state of the water remain unchanged. Option D. adding HCl. Incorrect. Adding hydrochloric acid to water will result in a chemical reaction, as HCl will dissociate into 1 H + and 1 Cl - , leading to changes in the composition of the solution. This is a chemical reaction is an acid-base reaction involving the formation of new substances (H 3 O 1+ ). Option E. putting active metals into the water. Incorrect. Adding active metals to water can lead to a chemical reaction because it results in the formation of new substances with different properties from the reactants.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving physical and chemical reactions , we will need to know the difference between a physical change and a chemical reaction: We know during electrolysis of water, an electric current is passed through water, leading to the breakdown of water molecules (H 2 O) into hydrogen (H 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ) gases. This process involves the formation of new substances with different properties. Therefore, this process is a chemical reaction. In this case, a chemical reaction is the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases. Option A. Boiling water to form steam Incorrect. When water is boiled to form steam, its state changes from a liquid (water) to a gaseous state (steam) without changing the chemical composition of the water molecules. This is a physical change because the substance involved remains the same and only its physical state has changed. Option B. Melting candle wax Incorrect. When melting candle wax, the state of the wax molecules changes from solid to liquid – this is a physical change. However, if we burned candle wax, this would have been a chemical change. Option C. Dissolving sugar in water Incorrect. When sugar is dissolved in water, the sugar molecules spread out and become uniformly mixed with the water molecules. This process involves a change in the arrangement and distribution of particles but does not result in the formation of new substances with different chemical properties. Therefore, it is considered a physical change. Option D. Electrolytes of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases Correct. During electrolysis of water, an electric current is passed through water, leading to the breakdown of water molecules (H 2 O) into hydrogen (H 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ) gases. This process involves the formation of new substances with different properties. Therefore, this process is a chemical reaction. Option E. Grinding rocks into smaller pieces Incorrect. Grinding rocks into smaller pieces is a physical change. This process involves changing the size and surface area of the particles. No new substances are formed during this process, and the chemical composition of the rocks remains unchanged. Therefore, the answer is D .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving physical and chemical reactions , we will need to know the difference between a physical change and a chemical reaction: We know that chemical reactions involve a change in the chemical composition to form new substances with different chemical properties. In this case, the exception is aluminum foil melting at 660 °C . During this process, the solid aluminum foil transitions into a liquid state while its chemical composition remains unchanged. Option A. H 2 O 2 decomposing to form O 2 and H 2 O Incorrect. This is a chemical reaction because H 2 O 2 breaking down into O 2 and H 2 O involves the rearrangement of atoms and the formation of new substances (O 2 and H 2 O). Option B. Methanol burning in air with a colorless flame Incorrect. This is a chemical reaction because burning methanol involves combustion reaction, producing new substances, such as CO 2 and H 2 O. Option C. Aluminum foil melting at 660 °C Correct. This is a physical change because melting is a process where a solid substance changes its state to become a liquid, but its chemical composition remains the same. No new substances are formed during melting. Option D. Hydrochloric acid neutralizing a solution of sodium hydroxide Incorrect. This is a chemical reaction. Hydrochloric acid reacting with sodium hydroxide results in the formation of water and NaCl salt. This is an example of an acid-base neutralization reaction. Option E. Iron metal rusting Incorrect. This is a chemical reaction because iron reacts with oxygen and water to form iron oxide, involving the rearrangement of atoms and the formation of new substances. Therefore, the answer is C .",
