      "concept_text": "Option A. Hybridization is a permanent characteristic of an element Incorrect. Hybridization of an element's orbitals can change when it forms different compounds or participates in various chemical reactions. Therefore, it is not a permanent characteristic of an element. Hybridization of an element can change when an atom forms. Option B. sp, sp 2 , and sp 3 orbitals have the same shape Incorrect. sp , sp 2 , and sp 3 orbitals do not have the same shape. In sp hybridization, one s orbital and one p orbital combine to form two sp hybrid orbitals. In sp 2 hybridization, one s orbital and two p orbitals combine to form three sp 2 hybrid orbitals. In sp 3 hybridization, one s orbital and three p orbitals combine to form four sp 3 hybrid orbitals. So, these three types of hybridization result in orbitals with distinctly different shapes. (The exact shape of these orbitals are not important for the exam.) Option C. All hybridized orbitals of sp 3 have the same energy Correct. In sp 3 hybridization, where one s -orbital and three p -orbitals combine to form four sp 3 hybrid orbitals, all the resulting hybrid orbitals have the same energy. Option D. There are only three types of hybridized orbitals: sp, sp 2 , and sp 3 Incorrect. There can be additional hybridization types beyond sp , sp 2 , and sp 3 in more complex molecules, especially those involving d -orbitals. Some examples of additional hybridization types include sp 3 d and sp 3 d 2 . Option E. All atoms in a molecule must undergo hybridization Incorrect. In a molecule, some atoms may undergo hybridization while others may not. It depends on the structure of the molecule. For example, CH 4 has a central carbon atom that undergoes sp 3 hybridization to form four equivalent sp 3 hybrid orbitals, which then form sigma bonds with s orbitals of 4 hydrogen atoms. Although the carbon’s orbital is hybridized, the hydrogen’s orbitals are not. Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "Option A. the formation of new elements. Incorrect. Hybridization does not involve the creation of new elements. Hybridization involves the atomic orbitals of existing elements combining to form new molecular orbitals within molecules. Option B. a physical change in matter. Incorrect. Hybridization is not a physical change in matter. Hybridization describes the rearrangement of electron orbitals within atoms to form hybrid orbitals. Physical change involves a change in the physical properties of a substance (such as state) without changing its chemical composition. Option C. a change in the mass of an atom. Incorrect. Hybridization does not bring about a significant change in the mass of an atom. An atom's mass is predominantly dictated by the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus, with electrons contributing negligibly to its overall weight. Option D. the mixing of atomic orbitals. Correct. Hybridization combines the atomic orbitals of an atom to create new hybrid orbitals. These hybrid orbitals have different shapes and energies than the original atomic orbitals. Option E. no change in geometry of orbitals. Incorrect. Hybridization is closely related to changes in the geometry of atomic orbitals. By mixing atomic orbitals, hybridization can lead to the formation of new hybrid orbitals with specific geometries. Therefore, the answer is D .",

To accommodate for three sigma bonds, NH 3 exhibits sp 3 hybridization: Option B. CH 4 Incorrect. In CH 4 , the central carbon atom forms four sigma bonds with four hydrogen atoms. To accommodate these four sigma bonds, the central carbon atom undergoes sp 3 hybridization, resulting in four sp 3 hybrid orbitals: Option C. H 2 O Incorrect. H 2 O has an oxygen (O) atom at its center, which forms two sigma bonds with two hydrogen (H) atoms and also has two lone pairs of electrons. To accommodate for the two lone pairs of electrons and two sigma bonds, oxygen in H 2 O exhibits sp 3 hybridization: Option D. CO 2 Correct. In CO 2 , the central carbon atom forms two sigma bonds with two oxygen atoms. In addition, the carbon atom also forms two pi bond with the two oxygen atoms (which forms the double bonds). To accommodate these two sigma bonds, the central carbon atom undergoes sp hybridization, resulting in two sp hybrid orbitals. Therefore, a molecule that has a central atom with sp hybridization is CO 2 . Therefore, the exception is CO 2 : Option E. PH 3 Incorrect. PH 3 has a phosphorus (P) atom at its center, which forms three sigma bonds with three hydrogen (H) atoms and has a lone pair of electrons. To accommodate for three sigma bonds and a lone pair of electrons, the phosphorus atom in PH 3 exhibits sp 3 hybridization: Therefore, the answer is D .",
