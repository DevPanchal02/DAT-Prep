This configuration is invalid because the 3 p orbital (which can hold a maximum of 6 electrons) only has 4 electrons. However, the 4 s orbital already contains 2 electrons. This is a violation of the Aufbau Principle, because electrons must completely fill lower-energy orbitals before filling higher-energy ones. Instead, the 2 additional electrons should be completed in the 3 p orbital, giving us 1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 6 3 s 2 3 p 6 . Therefore, the answer is B .",

Correct. This electron configuration is correct because it contains 7 electrons and obeys Hund’s Rule. Option B. Incorrect. This electron configuration is incorrect because although it contains 7 electrons, it violates Hund’s Rule by pairing electrons in the first orbital before singly filling the third orbital. Option C. Incorrect. This electron configuration is incorrect because it contains 8 electrons, instead of 7 (this is the electron configuration for oxygen). Option D. Incorrect. This electron configuration is incorrect because although it contains 7 electrons, it violates the Aufbau Principle adding electrons to the 2 p orbital before completely filling the 2 s orbital. Option E. Incorrect. This electron configuration is incorrect because it contains 6 electrons, instead of 7 (this is the electron configuration of carbon). Therefore, the answer is A .",

Option A. Incorrect. This electron configuration is incorrect because the 3 d subshell contains only 3 electrons, but it should have a total of 6 electrons (this is the electron configuration for vanadium). Option B. Correct. This electron configuration is correct because the 3 d subshell has 6 electrons and obeys Hund’s Rule and the Aufbau Principle Option C. Incorrect. This electron configuration is incorrect because the 4 s must be completely filled with 2 electrons prior to adding electrons to the 3 d orbital, according to the Aufbau Principle. Option D. Incorrect. This electron configuration is incorrect because it violates Hund’s Rule. Although there are 6 electrons in the 3 d orbital, the electrons must singly occupy the orbitals prior to pairing up. Option E. Incorrect. This electron configuration is incorrect because the 3 d subshell has 8 electrons and the 4 s subshell has none. This violates the Aufbau Principle, which tells us that electrons fill subshells from lowest to highest energy levels (the 4 s subshell is lower in energy than 3 d ). Therefore, the answer is B .",
