Since boron is a group 13 element, it will have 3 valence electrons. In this case, aluminum is also found in group 13, below boron on the periodic table.

Next, we fill the octet of the surrounding elements. Then, we use 2 electrons from O to make a double bond between O and N and we add the remaining electrons to N. As we can see, NO 2 - has one double bond and one single bond. Option B. NH 3 Incorrect. To draw the diagram for NH 3 , we first place N in the middle and connect it to each H with a single bond. Each H has a full shell with 2 electrons, so we do not add any additional electrons. Then, we use the remaining electrons to achieve a full octet for N. As we can see, NH 3 has three single bonds . Option C. N 2 H 4 Incorrect. To draw the diagram for N 2 H 4 , first we place the N’s in the middle, and connect it to each H with a single bond. Each H has a full shell with 2 electrons, so we do not add any additional electrons. Next, fill the octet of N with the remaining electrons. As we can see, N 2 H 4 has five single bonds . Option D. NCl 3 Incorrect. To draw the diagram for NCl 3 , we first place N in the middle and connect it to each Cl with a single bond. Next, we fill the octet of the surrounding elements. Then, we use the remaining electrons to achieve a full octet for N. As we can see, NCl 3 has three single bonds . Option E. HCN Correct. To draw the diagram for HCN, we first place C in the middle and connect it to N and H with a single bond. Next, we fill the octet of the surrounding elements (in this case, we only fill the octet of N). Since we have no additional electrons, to achieve a full octet for C, we use 4 electrons from N to make a triple bond between C and N. As we can see, HCN has one triple bond and one single bond.
