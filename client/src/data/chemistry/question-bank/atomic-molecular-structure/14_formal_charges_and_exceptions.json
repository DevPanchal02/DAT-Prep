      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving formal charges , let’s review the steps to drawing a Lewis dot diagram (which depict the bonding between the atoms of a molecule, as well as any lone pairs of electrons that may exist in a molecule), and calculating formal charges: STEP 1: Surround the central atom with other atoms. In this case, there is no “central atom”: STEP 2: Calculate the total number of valence electrons. Carbon (group 14) has 4 valence electrons and nitrogen (group 15) has 5 valence electrons. Since cyanide has an overall charge of -1, there is an additional electron: 4 e - + 5 e - + 1 e - = 10 e - STEP 3: Make a single bond between the atoms. In this case, since we have 1 bond, 2 e - are used, and so we have a total of 10 e - – 2 e - = 8 e - leftover. STEP 4: Fill the octet of surrounding atoms. To fill each atom, we would need 12 e - ; however, we only have 8 e - available. In this case, let’s add an additional bond between the atoms. Since we have 2 bonds, 4 e - are used, and so we have a total of 10 e - – 4 e - = 6 e - leftover. STEP 5: Let’s try again to fill the octet of surrounding atoms. To fill each atom, we would need 8 e - ; however, we only have 6 e - available. In this case, let’s add an additional bond between the atoms. Since we have 3 bonds, 6 e - are used, and so we have a total of 10 e - – 6 e - = 4 e - leftover. STEP 6: Let’s try again to fill the octet of surrounding atoms. To fill each atom, we need 2 e - and so all 4 e - are used up. This is the final structure of CN - . STEP 7: Determine the formal charge of N using the formula. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, 2 non-bonding electrons and 3 bonds: Formal Charge = (# of valence e - ) – (# of nonbonding e - ) – (# of bonds) Formal charge = 5 – 2 – 3 = 0 STEP 8: Determine the formal charge of C using the formula. Carbon has 4 valence electrons, 2 non-bonding electrons, and 3 bonds: Formal Charge = (# of valence e - ) – (# of nonbonding e - ) – (# of bonds) Formal charge = 4 – 2 – 3 = -1 In this case, CN – has a carbon atom with a formal charge of -1 .

Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, 0 non-bonding electrons, and 4 bonds: Formal Charge = (# of valence e - ) – (# of nonbonding e - ) – (# of bonds) Formal charge = 5 – 0 – 4 = +1 In this case, NO 3 – has a nitrogen atom with a formal charge of +1.

The central atom is the least electronegative atom. In this case, Xe is less electronegative than F (Tip: recall that F is the most electronegative element on the periodic table): STEP 2: Calculate the total number of valence electrons. Xenon (group 18) has 8 valence electrons and fluorine (group 17) has 7 valence electrons. 8 e - + 7 e - + 7 e - = 22 e - STEP 3: Make a single bond between the atoms. In this case, since we have 2 bonds, 4 e - are used, and so we have a total of 22 e - – 4 e - = 1 8 e - leftover. STEP 4: Fill the octet of surrounding atoms. To fill each atom, we need 6 e - , and so we have a total of 18 e - – 12 e - = 6 e - leftover. STEP 5: Give the remaining electrons to the central atom. Xe has 8 valence electrons in its outermost shell: 2 in the 5 s orbital and 6 in the 5 p orbital. F has 7 valence electrons in its outermost shell: 2 in the 2 s orbital and 5 in the 2 p orbital. F only needs one more electron to achieve the stable state of a noble gas, so it only forms one bond. In this instance, since there are 2 halogens (F), 2 valence electrons from Xe are used to form the bonds while the remaining 6 electrons form 3 “lone pairs”. Xe forms an expanded octet . In this case, XeF 2 has 18 non-bonding electrons. Therefore, the answer is C.",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving exceptions to the octet rule , draw out each electron to determine if the octet rule is followed. Recall that the octet rule states that atoms prefer to have eight electrons in the valence shell. However, there are certain electrons that don’t follow the octet rule: Option A. AlCl 3 Incorrect. Al has 3 valence electrons in its outermost shell: 2 electrons in the 3 s orbital and 1 electron in the 3 p orbital. Therefore, Al can form 3 bonds with three different atoms. Cl has 7 valence electrons in its outermost shell: 2 in the 3 s orbital and 5 in the 3 p orbital. Cl only needs one more electron to achieve the stable state of a noble gas, so it only forms one bond. In this instance, each valence electron from Al forms 1 bond with each Cl atom. Option B. BeH 2 Incorrect. Be has 2 valence electrons in its outermost shell in the 2 s orbital. H only has 1 valence electron in its outermost shell in the 1 s orbital. B eH 2 has a total of 4 valence electrons, so it can only form a total of 2 bonds. Option C. AsBr 3 Correct. As has 5 valence electrons in its outermost shell: 2 in the 4 s orbital and 3 in the 4 p orbital. As can form up to 5 bonds with a halogen, like Br. Br has 7 valence electrons in its outermost shell: 2 in the 4 s orbital and 5 in the 4 p orbital. Br only needs one more electron to achieve the stable state of a noble gas, so it only forms one bond. In this instance, since there are 3 halogens (Br), 3 valence electrons from arsenic are used to form the bonds, while the remaining 2 electrons form a “lone pair”. As a result, each atom has a complete octet. Option D. SF 4 Incorrect. S has 6 valence electrons in its outermost shell: 2 in the 3 s orbital and 4 in the 3 p orbital. S can form up to 6 bonds with a halogen, like F. F has 7 valence electrons in its outermost shell: 2 in the 2 s orbital and 5 in the 2 p orbital. F only needs one more electron to achieve the stable state of a noble gas, so it only forms one bond. In this instance, since there are 4 halogens (F), 4 valence electrons from S are used to form the bonds, while the remaining 2 electrons form a “lone pair”. Option E. XeF 4 Incorrect. Xe has 8 valence electrons in its outermost shell: 2 in the 5 s orbital and 6 in the 5 p orbital. F has 7 valence electrons in its outermost shell: 2 in the 2 s orbital and 5 in the 2 p orbital. F only needs one more electron to achieve the stable state of a noble gas, so it only forms one bond. In this instance, since there are 4 halogens (F), 4 valence electrons from Xe are used to form the bonds while the remaining 4 electrons form 2 “lone pairs”. Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving formal charges , let’s review the steps to drawing a Lewis dot diagram (which depict the bonding between the atoms of a molecule, as well as any lone pairs of electrons that may exist in a molecule), and calculating formal charges: STEP 1: Surround the central atom with other atoms. The central atom is the least electronegative atom. In this case, Xe is less electronegative than F (Tip: recall that F is the most electronegative element on the periodic table): STEP 2: Calculate the total number of valence electrons. Xenon (group 18) has 8 valence electrons and fluorine (group 17) has 7 valence electrons: 8 e - + 7 e - + 7 e - + 7 e - + 7 e - = 36 e - STEP 3: Make a single bond between the atoms. In this case, since we have 4 bonds, 8 e - are used, and so we have a total of 36 e - – 8 e - = 28 e - leftover. STEP 4: Fill the octet of surrounding atoms. To fill each atom, we need 6 e - , and so we have a total of 28 e - – 24 e - = 4 e - leftover. STEP 5: Give the remaining electrons to the central atom. Xe has 8 valence electrons in its outermost shell: 2 in the 5 s orbital and 6 in the 5 p orbital. F has 7 valence electrons in its outermost shell: 2 in the 2 s orbital and 5 in the 2 p orbital. F only needs one more electron to achieve the stable state of a noble gas, so it only forms one bond. In this instance, since there are 4 halogens (F), 4 valence electrons from Xe are used to form the bonds while the remaining 4 electrons form 2 “lone pairs”. Xe forms an expanded octet . STEP 6: Determine the formal charge of Xe using the formula: Formal Charge = (# of valence e - ) – (# of nonbonding e - ) – (# of bonds) Formal charge = 8 – 4 – 4 = 0 Xenon has 8 valence electrons, 4 non-bonding electrons and 4 bonds. Xenon has a formal charge of 0. In this case, XeF 4 has a xenon atom with a formal charge of 0 . Therefore, the answer is C.",
