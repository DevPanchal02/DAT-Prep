Letâs first review which orbital we need to focus on when adding or removing electrons: STEP 1: First, we know that Zn has an electron configuration of [Ar] 4 s 2 3 d 10 , which has the following orbital diagram: STEP 2: Next, we remove 2 electrons to find the orbital diagram of Zn 2+ , making sure to remove electrons from the highest available energy level. It is important to know that the filled 4 s subshell is higher in energy than the 3 d subshell because 4 s electrons are farther and more loosely held by the nucleus. So, since it is more energetically favorable to remove the electrons from the higher-energy 4 s orbital, 2 electrons will be removed from the 4 s orbital: Therefore, the answer is A .",

It is important to know that the filled 4 s subshell is higher in energy than the 3 d subshell because 4 s electrons are farther and more loosely held by the nucleus. So, since it is more energetically favorable to remove the electrons from the higher-energy 4 s orbital, one electron will be removed from the 4 s orbital: Therefore, the answer is E .",

Instead, one of the electrons from the 5 s orbital is excited, and rises to the 4 d orbital: [Kr] 5 s 1 4 d 5 STEP 2: Next, we need to remove an electron from Mo, making sure to remove from the highest energy level. It is important to know that the filled 5 s subshell is higher in energy than the 4 d subshell because 5 s electrons are farther and more loosely held by the nucleus.
