In this case, since we have a less electronegative Mg and a more electronegative Cl , this pair is most likely to form an ionic bond. Mg will donate 2 electrons from its outermost shell to 2 separate Cl atoms to form Mg 2+ and 2 Cl - , which will be attracted to each other to form MgCl 2 . In comparison, the other options involve pairs of atoms that do not exhibit significant differences in electronegativity, so they are less likely to form ionic bonds. We can also see this by comparing each pairs’ position on the periodic table, keeping in mind that electronegativity increases as we move from left to right across the periodic table (excluding noble gases). Mg and Cl are furthest apart on the periodic table compared to the other electron pair choices, which are found relatively close together. Therefore, the answer is C .",

Bond energy is the measure of energy needed to break a covalent bond. As the number of bonds increases , more energy is required to break the bond Option B. Bond strength Incorrect. Bond strength is the measure of how tightly two atoms are held together. As the number of bonds increases , the number of shared electrons increases , which makes the bond stronger . Option C. Bond polarity Correct. Bond polarity describes the distribution of electrons and charges in a bond. Since this is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the bonded atoms, we cannot say that as the number of bonds increases , the bond polarity increases . Option D. Bond rigidity Incorrect. Bond rigidity describes whether atoms in a bond are free to rotate with respect to each other. Compared to single bonds, the presence of π bonds in double and triple bonds restricts the rotation of atoms around the bond axis, making the bond more rigid. As the number of bonds increases , the bond is more rigid . Option E. Bond stability Incorrect. Bond stability is similar in definition to bond strength. As the number of bonds increases , there are more shared electrons that leads to a stronger overall interaction, making the molecule more stable. Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving the coordinate covalent bond , we need to know that in a coordinate covalent bond, both electrons that form the bond come from the same atom, as shown below in the Lewis Diagram for NH 3 + BF 3 → H 3 NBF 3 : Option A. Hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) sharing electrons to form water (H 2 O) Incorrect. This is a normal covalent bond, because H and O each share 1 electron to form the “O-H” bond in H 2 O. Option B. Sodium (Na) donating an electron to chlorine (Cl) to form salt (NaCl) Incorrect. This is an ionic bond because Na permanently donates its 1 valence electron to Cl, and the resulting Na + and Cl - form the stable ionic compound NaCl. Option C. Two fluorine (F) atoms sharing electrons to form fluorine gas (F 2 ) Incorrect. This is a normal covalent bond, because both F atoms each share 1 electron to form the “F-F” bond in F 2 . Option D. Ammonia (NH 3 ) forming a bond with a hydrogen ion (H + ) Correct. This is a coordinate covalent bond, because NH 3 donates both electrons to H + to form NH 4 + . This is because H + has no valence electrons to donate, so the only way a bond can be formed is by NH 3 donating its lone pair. Option E . Oxygen and carbon forming a double bond in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) Incorrect. This is a covalent bond, because both oxygen and carbon share their electrons to form the “C-O” double bonds in carbon dioxide. Therefore, the answer is D .",
