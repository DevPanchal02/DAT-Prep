      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving quantum numbers , we will need to review the values that each quantum number can take on based on the element: In this case, we will also need to consider which orbital ( s, p, d, f ) the outermost valence electrons are located in. Option A. Li and Na Incorrect. Li has a principal quantum number of 2, whereas Na has a principal quantum number of 3. When (n = 2), ( l = 0 to 1), (m l = -1 to 1), and (m s = -1/2 or +1/2). In comparison, when (n = 3), ( l = 0 to 2), (m l = -2 to 2), and (m s = -1/2 or +1/2). Option B. N and O Correct. N and O both have a principal quantum number of 2, so when (n = 2), ( l = 0 or 1), (m l = -1, to 1), and (m s = -1/2 or +1/2). In addition, their outermost valence electrons are both located in the 2 p orbital, so it is possible for N and O to have the same sets of quantum numbers. Option C. S and Se Incorrect. S has a principal quantum number of 3, whereas Se has a principal quantum number of 4.  When (n = 3), ( l = 0 to 2), (m l = -2 to 2), and (m s = -1/2 or +1/2). In comparison, when (n = 4), ( l = 0 to 3), (m l = -3 to 3), and (m s = -1/2 or +1/2). Option D. Cl and Br Incorrect. Cl has a principal quantum number of 3, whereas Br has a principal quantum number of 4. When (n = 3), ( l = 0 to 3), (m l = -2 to 2), and (m s = -1/2 or +1/2). In comparison, when (n = 4), ( l = 0 to 3), (m l = -3 to 3), and (m s = -1/2 or +1/2). Option E. Mg and Al Incorrect. Mg and Al both have a principal quantum number of 3, so when (n = 3), ( l = 0 to 2), (m l = -2 to 2), and (m s = -1/2 or +1/2). However, the valence electrons in Mg are in the 3 s orbital , resulting in ( l = 0), whereas the valence electrons in Al are located in the 3 p orbital , resulting in ( l = 1). This means that Al will have a larger possible set of quantum numbers compared to Mg. Therefore, the answer is B .",

STEP 1: We know that calcium has a principal quantum number (n) of 4, so the highest energy level an electron can be in calcium is at n = 4. STEP 2: We can also see based on the periodic table that calcium only has 2 valence electrons, so they would occupy the s orbital. We know that the s orbital corresponds to an azimuthal quantum number ( l ) of 0. STEP 3: When l = 0, the m l = 0. The m s can be -either 1/2 or +1/2. Only Option E (4, 0, 0, +1/2) matches these quantum numbers. Therefore, the answer is E .",
