      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving the properties of solids , let’s first review their general properties. Solids are incompressible with a definite shape and volume due to their strong intermolecular forces and close intermolecular distances. In this case, we can say that a characteristic of the solid state of matter is that solids have a definite volume . Option A. Solids are compressible Incorrect. Solids are incompressible because the particle distances inside the molecule are minimal in solids. Gases, conversely, can be compressed because they have large distances between particles. Option B. Solids contain weak intermolecular forces Incorrect. Solids have the highest intermolecular forces of attraction and smallest intermolecular spaces compared to liquids and gases. Option C. Solids have a definite volume Correct. Solids have a definite volume due to their strong intermolecular forces of attraction. This allows the particles in a solid to vibrate around the fixed locations. Option D. Solids expand to fill the container Incorrect. Solids are rigid and have a definite volume and shape because of their strong intermolecular forces of attraction. Thus, solids do not expand to fill the container. Option E. Solids are always conductive Incorrect. Although there are solids that are conductive, like metal and steel, there are also solids that are non-conductive, like paper and gla ss. Therefore, the answer is C .",

Covalent network solids are poor conductors because the electrons are tightly held between the atoms and lack free ions. Therefore, the answer is B .",

A molecule, for example, can be a covalent network solid and a crystalline solid, like a diamond. In this case, we can say that crystalline solids form a more orderly array of molecules. Option A. Amorphous solids have a more defined pattern Incorrect. Amorphous solids do not have a defined pattern and lack an ordered structure. Instead, crystalline solids have a more defined pattern. Option B. Amorphous solids form definite lattice structures Incorrect. Amorphous solids lack definite lattice structures. Instead, crystalline solids form a definite lattice structure. Option C. Amorphous solids can be further defined by the unit cell Incorrect. Unit cells are the smallest individual repeating unit cells that crystalline solids represent, not amorphous solids. Option D. Crystalline solids form a more orderly array of molecules Correct. Crystalline solids consist of a crystal lattice and strongly ordered arrangement, which is defined by the unit cell. Unit cells are the smallest individual repeating units of the crystal lattice. Option E. Crystalline solids are electrically non-conductive Incorrect. Crystalline solids can be both conductive and non-conductive. For example, metallic crystals are good conductors, while diamonds are poor conductors of electricity. Therefore, the answer is D .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving the types of unit cells , let’s first review what unit cells are. Unit cells are the smallest individual repeating units of the crystal that crystalline solids represent. Let’s then review the three types of unit cells: STEP 1 : First, we see that silver (Ag) in the eight corners of the cube each contribute 1/8 of an atom giving us one atom of silver : STEP 2 : Next, we see that lead (Pb) in the six faces of the cube each contribute 1/2 an atom giving us three atoms of lead : STEP 3 : Finally, because for every atom of silver (Ag) there are three atoms of lead (Pb), the molecular composition of the unit cell would be AgPb 3 , with a total of 4 atoms per unit cell. Therefore, the answer is C .",

Unit cells are the smallest individual repeating units of the crystal that crystalline solids represent. Let’s then review the three types of unit cells: In this case, in a body-centered cubic lattice , the eight corners of the cube each contribute 1/8 of an atom to give us a single atom, and the center atom gives us another atom. STEP 1: First, if the copper (Cu) atoms were to be at each corner of the cube, each corner will contribute to one-eight of the copper atom which would sum up to one copper atom: STEP 2: Next, if the iron (Fe) were to be at the center, one iron atom would take up the center. STEP 3: Thus, because there is 1 atom of iron (Fe) for 1 atom of copper (Cu), the molecular composition of the unit cell would be CuFe, with a total of 2 atoms per unit cell. Therefore, the answer is A .",
