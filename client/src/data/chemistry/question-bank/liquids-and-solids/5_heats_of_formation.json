The heat of vaporization is greater than the heat of fusion Correct. In vaporization, molecules go from a flowing liquid state into a freely moving gaseous state, which requires more energy than fusion, in which molecules go from a locked solid state to a flowing liquid state. Option B. The heat of vaporization is greater than the heat of sublimation Incorrect. In vaporization, molecules go from a flowing liquid state into a freely moving gaseous state, which requires less energy than sublimation, in which molecules go from a locked solid state to a freely moving gaseous state. Option C. The heat of fusion is greater than the heat of sublimation Incorrect. In fusion, molecules go from a locked solid state to a flowing liquid state, which requires less energy than sublimation, in which molecules go from a locked solid state to a freely moving gaseous state. Option D. The heat of fusion is greater than the heat of vaporization Incorrect. In fusion, molecules go from a locked solid state to a flowing liquid state, which requires less energy than vaporization, in which molecules go from a flowing liquid state into a freely moving gaseous state.

Since the formation equation must result in 1 mole of a substance produced, we cannot change the coefficient of CaCO 3( s ) .

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving heats of formation , we will need to use the enthalpy change for the reaction and the given standard heats of formation to calculate the unknown standard heat of formation. STEP 1 : The equation for calculating the enthalpy change is as follows: STEP 2 : In this case, we are given the enthalpy change of the reaction and the standard heats of formation for some of the substances. Since O 2( g ) is an element in its standard state, its ΔH o f is zero. We also need to keep in mind that standard heats of formation will differ for elements in different states, and we must use H 2 O ( g ) instead of H 2 O ( l ) . -906 = [(6 mol H 2 O ( g ) )(-241.8) + (4 mol NO ( g ) )(90.3)] – [(1 mol NH 3( g ) )(ΔH o f of NH 3( g ) )] STEP 3 : We can now rearrange to solve for ΔH o f of NH 3( g ) . -906 = [6(-241.8) + 4(90.3)] – (ΔH o f of NH 3( g ) ) ΔH o f of NH 3( g ) = 906 + [6(-241.8) + 4(90.3)] Therefore, the answer is A .",

      "concept_text": "Solution To solve this problem involving heats of formation , we will need to review Hess’ Law and how to apply it. To find the overall enthalpy change for reaction, we can sum up the enthalpy changes of its intermediate reactions. When we manipulate equations, we also change the ΔH o as follows: The provided heats of formations are: A → B + 3D ΔH o = ? kJ·mol -1 A + 2B → 3C ΔH o f = -200 kJ·mol -1 C → B + D ΔH o f = -150 kJ·mol -1 STEP 1 : Looking at the 1st equation for the overall enthalpy change, we see that there is 3 D on the product side. The only other place there is compound D is in the 3rd equation. Therefore, we multiply the 3rd equation by 3 to match the 3 D in the 1st equation. 3 C → 3 B + 3 D                              ΔH o f = -450 kJ•mol -1 STEP 2 : When we look at the 2nd equation, there is 1 A on the reactant side, which matches with the 1 A in the 1st equation. We can now add the 2nd and 3rd equations together to result in the 1st equation. We can cancel out molecules if they are on opposite (reactant and product) sides. A + 2 B → 3 C ΔH o f = -200 kJ•mol -1 3 C → 3 B + 3 D                               ΔH o f = -450 kJ•mol -1 STEP 3 : Both 3 C compounds cancel each other out, and there is 1 B remaining on the product side. The resulting equation and overall enthalpy change is as follows: A → B + 3 D                                      ΔH o = -650 kJ·mol -1 Therefore, the answer is A .",

To find the overall enthalpy change for reaction, we can sum up the enthalpy changes of its intermediate reactions. When we manipulate equations, we also change the ΔH o as follows: STEP 1 : Looking at the equation for the formation of glucose, we see that we need C 6 H 12 O 6( s ) to be on the product side. In equation 1, it is on the reactant side. We can reverse the equation to bring C 6 H 12 O 6( s ) to the opposite side, but according to Hess’ Law, we also need to multiply ΔH o 1 by -1. 6 CO 2( g ) + 6 H 2 O ( l ) → C 6 H 12 O 6( s ) + 6 O 2( g ) ΔH o 1 = -X STEP 2 : We also see that we need 6 C ( s ) on the reactant side. We can multiply equation 2 by 6 to obtain this: 6 C ( s ) + 6 O 2( g ) → 6 CO 2( g ) ΔH o 2 = 6Y STEP 3 :  Finally, we see that we need 6 H2 ( g ) on the reactant side.
