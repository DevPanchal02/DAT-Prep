      "concept_text": "Option A . An increase in entropy leads to increased order in the system Incorrect. Entropy is defined as the amount of disorder or randomness in a system. An increase in entropy leads to increased disorder in the system. Option B. A positive ΔS value indicates a decrease in disorder Incorrect. Entropy, denoted as ΔS, indicates the amount of disorder of a system. When the ΔS value is positive, it indicates there is an increase in disorder. Option C. An element in gas form has a lower ΔS value than its liquid form Incorrect. An element in gas form has a higher amount of disorder than its liquid form because the molecules in the gas spread out more, move faster, and collide with each other more often compared to a liquid. Since the gas form has a higher amount of entropy, this means that it has a higher ΔS value than its liquid form. Option D. An element in gas form has higher entropy than its solid form Correct. An element in gas form has a higher amount of disorder than its solid form because the molecules in the gas spread out more, move faster, and collide with each other more often compared to a solid, where the molecules are tightly packed. Since the gas form has a higher amount of disorder, it means that it has a higher entropy. Option E. An element in liquid form has lower entropy than its solid form Incorrect. An element in liquid form has a higher amount of disorder than its solid form because the molecules in the liquid spread out and move more freely compared to a solid, where the molecules are tightly packed. Since the liquid form has a higher amount of disorder, it means that it has a higher entropy. Therefore, the answer is D.",

      "concept_text": "Keep in mind we need to find the statement that is not correct about enthalpy (H). Option A . Enthalpy is a state function and is path-independent Incorrect. Enthalpy is a state function because it only depends on the initial and final state of the system, making it path independent. Option B. Enthalpy measures the total heat energy of a system Incorrect. Enthalpy is defined as a measure of the total heat energy in a thermodynamics system. Option C. Enthalpy change (ΔH) depends only on the final state of the system Correct. Enthalpy change ΔH depends on both the initial and final state of the system. Without the initial state of the system, we cannot determine how much enthalpy changed . Option D. When heat moves out of a system, the reaction is exothermic Incorrect. When heat moves out of a system, the heat is lost to the surroundings. This corresponds with a decrease in enthalpy of the system, or an exothermic process. Option E. A positive ΔH value indicates the reaction is endothermic Incorrect. A positive ΔH value indicates an increase in enthalpy, meaning that the heat from the surroundings has been absorbed into a system. This corresponds with an endothermic reaction.

In this case, the process that would result in a decrease in entropy is one in which the molecules become more ordered . Because deposition involves a phase change from a gas to a solid, the molecules become more ordered, and entropy is decreased (Option E). Option A . Electrolysis of water Incorrect. Electrolysis of water results in the splitting of a water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen. This results in an increase in entropy since there are more independent molecules moving around, and therefore more disorder. Option B. Vaporization Incorrect. Vaporization is the conversion from liquid to gas. This results in an increase in entropy since gas has more disorder than liquid. Option C. Decomposition reactions Incorrect. Decomposition results in a molecule decomposing into its elements. This results in an increase in entropy since there are more molecules present, and therefore more disorder. Option D. Fusion Incorrect. Fusion is the conversion from solid to liquid. This results in an increase in entropy since liquid has more disorder than solid. Option E. Deposition Correct. Deposition is the conversion from gas to solid. This results in a decrease in entropy since solid has less disorder than gas. Therefore, the answer is E.",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving entropy and enthalpy , we will need to review the conversions between physical states and their relationship to enthalpy: We also need to recall that entropy is defined as the amount of disorder or randomness in a system. Option A . Condensation is an endothermic process Incorrect. Condensation is the conversion from gas to liquid. This process is exothermic since the heat energy from the gas must be removed into the surroundings for it to condense into a liquid. Option B. Deposition causes a decrease in entropy Correct. Deposition is the conversion from gas to solid. The molecules in a gas can freely move within their contained space, whereas the molecules in a solid are packed tightly and is less disordered. Since entropy is the amount of disorder in a system, the conversion from gas to solid results in a decrease in entropy. Option C. Vaporization causes a decrease in entropy Incorrect. Vaporization is the conversion from liquid to gas. The molecules in a gas can move much more freely compared to the molecules in a liquid, which means the gas has more disorder compared to the liquid. Therefore, the conversion from liquid to gas results in an increase in entropy. Option D. Sublimation causes a decrease in entropy Incorrect. Sublimation is the conversion from solid to gas. The molecules in a solid are packed more tightly than in a gas, where the molecules can freely move within their contained space and is more disordered. Since entropy is the amount of disorder in a system, the conversion from solid results in a increase in entropy. Option E. Fusion is an exothermic process Incorrect. Fusion is the conversion from solid to liquid. This process is endothermic since the solid must absorb heat energy to melt into a liquid. Therefore, the answer is B.",

      "concept_text": "Option A . It is the phase change from gas to solid Incorrect. Sublimation is the conversion from solid to gas. The phase change from gas to solid is deposition. Option B. It is the phase change from gas to liquid Incorrect. Sublimation is the conversion from solid to gas. The phase change from gas to liquid is condensation. Option C. It is an exothermic reaction Incorrect. When a solid converts into a gas, it requires an input of heat energy. The system absorbs heat from the surroundings to obtain the energy required to break the tight packing between molecules in a solid into the freely moving molecules in a gas. This process is an endothermic reaction. Option D. It is an endothermic reaction Correct. When a solid converts into a gas, it requires an input of heat energy. An input of heat energy is an endothermic reaction. The system absorbs heat from the surroundings to obtain the energy required to break the tight packing between molecules in a solid into the freely moving molecules in a gas. Option E. It has a negative entropy (ΔS) value Incorrect. When a solid converts into a gas, there is an increase in disorder since the gas molecules move more freely compared to the molecules in a solid. An increase in disorder means there is an increase in entropy, and a positive ΔS value. Therefore, the answer is D.",
