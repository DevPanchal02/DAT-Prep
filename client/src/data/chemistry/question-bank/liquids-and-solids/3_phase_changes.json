      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving phase changes , we need to understand what happens during phase changes. Option A. All phase changes involve chemical reactions Incorrect. All phase changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. This is because phase changes involve transitions between the physical states of matter without changing the chemical composition of the substance. Option B. Endothermic reactions release heat Incorrect. Endothermic reactions absorb heat whereas exothermic reactions release heat. Option C. Substances cannot directly change from gas to solid state Incorrect. Substances can directly change from gas to solid state by undergoing deposition without passing through the liquid phase. Option D. Solid particles generally exhibit the least amount of molecular movement Correct. In comparison to the other two states of matter (liquid and gas), solid particles typically have the least amount of molecular movement. In a solid, the particles are tightly packed and held in fixed positions by strong intermolecular forces. Option E. Phase changes alter the chemical composition of the molecules involved Incorrect. Phase changes do not alter the chemical composition of the molecules involved. Phase changes refer to the transition of a substance between its different physical states, such as solid, liquid, and gas, without changing the chemical composition of the molecules. Therefore, the answer is D .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving phase changes , we need to know the relationship between heat and phase changes: In this case, we need to find a phase change process that is an exothermic process, where heat is released. Condensation releases heat because when a gas condenses into a liquid, the gas molecules are giving up their thermal energy to become part of a more ordered and stable liquid structure. Therefore, an exothermic process is condensation . A good way to think about this concept is to recall what happens when you place your hand above hot steam. You feel an intense burn because the steam condenses to water, releasing a lot of thermal energy onto your hand. The rest of the options are endothermic processes, where heat is absorbed.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving phase changes , we need to understand how phase changes work for water: As we can see, when molecules change from liquid to solid, an exothermic reaction occurs (ΔH < 0), which implies that H 2 O molecules release energy. When particles lose energy, the molecules move more slowly and arrange themselves into a more ordered, crystalline structure of ice. Particles in liquid are generally slightly further apart than in a solid, but water is an exception since H 2 O molecules are slightly farther apart in ice than water. When water freezes, its molecules form a hexagonal lattice structure held together by hydrogen bonds, resulting in open spaces within the ice. This arrangement causes ice to have lower density and expand as it freezes, making it less dense than the liquid water. Therefore, when the water molecules change from liquid to solid, density decreases. A good way to remember this concept is to recall that ice floats on top of water, because ice is less dense than water. Therefore, the answer is D .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving phase changes , we need to know the relationship between heat and phase changes: In this case, it's important to understand that steam burns involve condensation, where hot water vapor transforms into water upon contact with skin. This transition is driven by the exchange of energy between the vapor and the skin. As the water vapor transfers its heat energy to the skin, it loses energy and transforms into water. This condensation process plays a crucial role in the severity of steam burns. Therefore, steam burns can be explained by when water vapor condenses, heat is released. Therefore, the answer is B .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving phase changes , we need to know the relationship between heat and phase changes: In this scenario, it's crucial to recognize the sequence of events. Firstly, vaporization occurs as water molecules transition from a liquid to a gas state, requiring the absorption of heat energy. Following that, the second step involves condensation, during which water molecules shift from a gas to a liquid state, and heat energy is released. Therefore, the heat of water molecules changes as the following: heat is absorbed; heat is released. Therefore, the answer is C .",
