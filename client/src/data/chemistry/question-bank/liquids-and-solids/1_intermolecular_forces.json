      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving intermolecular forces , we will need to know that CH 3 F has a net dipole for the following reasons: In this case, we can say that the electronegativity difference between the carbon and fluorine creates a polar bond . Option A. The geometry results in an equal sharing of electrons amongst its atoms Incorrect. The geometry of CH 3 F results in unequal sharing of electrons amongst its atoms because fluorine has higher electronegativity and attracts more of the electron cloud in the molecule. Option B. The carbon atom donates electrons to the fluorine, making the carbon partially negative Incorrect. The carbon atom donates electrons to fluorine, making the carbon partially positive . This is because fluorine exerts a stronger pull on the shared electrons. Option C. The electronegativity difference between carbon and fluorine creates a polar bond Correct. The large electronegativity difference between the carbon and fluorine leads to polarity within the carbon-fluorine bond. Fluorine’s high electronegativity causes it to attract more of the electrons within its covalent bond with carbon, leading to a partially negative fluorine atom and partially positive carbon. Option D. The carbon-hydrogen bonds have higher electronegativity differences compared to carbon-fluorine Incorrect. The carbon-hydrogen bonds have lower electronegativity differences compared to the carbon-fluorine bond. This is because there is a greater electronegativity difference between carbon and fluorine, compared to carbon and hydrogen. Option E. The partially negative fluorine atom results in the molecule to have no net dipole. Incorrect. The partially negative fluorine atom results in the molecule to have a net dipole in the direction of the fluorine atom. Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving intermolecular forces , we will need to know that the strength of London dispersion forces increases with size. Since iodine is lower on the periodic table than fluorine, I 2 is much larger and has greater molecular weight than F 2 . Therefore, I 2 has a larger electron cloud, which allows for greater fluctuations and larger temporary dipole moments. This leads to stronger London dispersion forces which causes I 2 to have a higher boiling point. In this case, I 2 has a higher boiling point than F 2 because I 2 has a larger electron cloud than F 2 . It is also important to note that both F 2 and I 2 do not engage in dipole-dipole forces, nor hydrogen bonds, because they are nonpolar. Therefore, the answer is D .",

Similarly, CO 3 2- , SO 3 , BF 3 , and NO 3 - are all nonpolar because they have symmetrical trigonal planar structures which causes the dipoles to cancel out: In this case, NH 3 is the exception because its lone electron pair causes an asymmetrical tetrahedral structure leading to a polar molecule: Therefore, the answer is A .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving intermolecular forces , we need to know that a molecule that does not have a net dipole will be incapable of forming a dipole-dipole interaction. Option A. HCN Incorrect. HCN is capable of forming a dipole-dipole interaction because the compound is asymmetrical. The nitrogen is the most electronegative atom in the compound and therefore, has the strongest attraction of the shared electrons. As a result, nitrogen is partially negative in comparison to the rest of the compound and the molecule has a net dipole. Option B. CO 2 Correct. CO 2 is incapable of forming a dipole-dipole interaction because the compound is symmetrical. Both oxygen atoms are more electronegative than the carbon atom and attract more of the shared electrons, making the oxygen atoms partially negative. However, due to the symmetrical nature of the molecule, the dipole moments cancel out, resulting in no net dipole. Option C. NO Incorrect. NO is capable of forming a dipole-dipole interaction because the compound is asymmetrical. The oxygen is more electronegative than the nitrogen and has a stronger attraction of the shared electrons. As a result, oxygen is partially negative in comparison to the nitrogen atom and the molecule has a net dipole. Option D. CO Incorrect. CO is capable of forming a dipole-dipole interaction because the compound is asymmetrical. The oxygen is more electronegative than the carbon and has a stronger attraction of the shared electrons. As a result, oxygen is partially negative in comparison to the carbon atom and the molecule has a net dipole. Option E. HCl Incorrect. HCl is capable of forming a dipole-dipole interaction because the compound is asymmetrical. The chlorine is more electronegative than the hydrogen and has a stronger attraction of the shared electrons. As a result, chlorine is partially negative in comparison to the carbon atom and the molecule has a net dipole. Therefore, the answer is B .",

Larger and longer molecules allow for more points of contact between the temporary positive and negative dipoles found in London dispersion forces, which lead to higher boiling points. Out of the given molecules, C 2 H 6 has the smallest surface area since it has the least amount of carbon atoms. Next, between the two C 4 H 10 molecules, molecule 3 has a smaller surface area than molecule 2 and its structure allows for less points of contact between the London dispersion forces of two C 4 H 10 molecules. Molecule 2, however, has a linear shape, allowing for more points of contact with other C 4 H 10 molecules. This can be visualized in the diagram below: Finally, C 2 H 8 O has an alcohol group, which can perform hydrogen bonding. Therefore, molecule 1 has the highest boiling point.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving intermolecular forces , we need to recall that an increase in intermolecular forces results in an increase in the boiling point of a molecule. Comparing our given answer choices, we can see that we are given CH 4 , and a list of different halogens bonded to CH 3 . As the size of the halogen increases, the size of the electron cloud increases. This results in stronger London dispersion forces, which at this molecular weight, plays a stronger role than dipole-dipole interactions. In this case, CH 3 I contains the largest halogen, which implies that it has the strongest interactions, and subsequently the greatest intermolecular forces and highest boiling point. Therefore, the answer is E .",

      "concept_text": "Option A. CH 4 < H 2 O < HF < Ne Incorrect. Since neon is a noble gas and does not bond to other atoms, it only exhibits London dispersion forces and cannot have a dipole moment. As a result, it does not have a higher boiling point than H 2 O and HF which can both undergo hydrogen bonding. Option B. CCl 4 < CH 3 Cl < NH 3 < CH 4 Incorrect. Since CH 4 is nonpolar, it can only exhibit London dispersion forces. As a result, it does not have a higher boiling point than CH 3 Cl and NH 3 , which both have a net dipole and can form dipole-dipole interactions. Option C. I 2 < Cl 2 < NH 3 < HF Incorrect. Since I 2 is much larger than Cl 2 , it has a larger electron cloud which allows for stronger temporary dipoles and therefore, stronger London dispersion forces. As a result, it does not have a lower boiling point than Cl 2 . Option D. H 2 < O 2 < CHCl 3 < H 2 O Correct. Both O 2 and H 2­ are nonpolar. However, O 2 has a higher boiling point than H 2 because O 2 has a larger molecular size and its larger electron cloud allows for stronger temporary dipoles and therefore, stronger London dispersion forces. CHCl 3 has a higher boiling point than both H 2 and O 2 because it has a net dipole which allows it to form dipole-dipole interactions. Finally, H 2 O has the highest boiling point out of the given options because it can undergo hydrogen bonding, which is stronger. Option E. C 3 H 6 O < CF 4 < H 2 O < H 2 O 2 Incorrect. Since C 3 H 6 O is a polar molecule, it can form dipole-dipole interactions. As a result, it does not have a lower boiling point than CF 4 which is a nonpolar molecule and only exhibits London dispersion forces. Therefore, the answer is D .",
