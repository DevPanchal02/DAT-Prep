The solubility product constant, K sp , is the equilibrium constant for a solid substance dissolved in an aqueous solution.

To determine the least soluble compound, we can look for the compound that has the smallest K sp value. Looking at the answer choices, CaF 2 (K sp = 3.2 × 10 -11 ) , is the least soluble compound.

The solution cannot dissolve any more solute, but no precipitate has formed Incorrect. A solution cannot dissolve any more solute when it is saturated, which occurs when the Q sp = K sp . Option C. Adding F - to the solution would help to increase the solubility of LiF Incorrect. Due to the common ion affect, which occurs when the solubility of an ion (F - ) is decreased by the addition of the same ion, adding F- into the solution would decrease the solubility of LiF. Option D. The solution can still dissolve additional LiF Correct. A solution that can continue to dissolve more ionic products is an unsaturated solution, which occurs when the Q sp < K sp .

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving solubility , we will need to compare the ion product constant (Q sp ) to the solubility product constant (K sp ) to determine whether a precipitate will form. The solubility product constant, K sp , is the equilibrium constant for a solid substance dissolved in an aqueous solution. The K sp is a measure of solubility; the more soluble the substance is, the greater the K sp value. This is because a greater K sp value means that there is a higher concentration of ions dissolved at equilibrium. Let’s look at how to write a K sp expression. Notice that each concentration in the K sp expression is raised to the power of its coefficient in the balanced equation, and that there are no solids ( s ) or liquids ( l ) included: A a B b( s ) ⇢ aA + ( aq ) + bB - ( aq ) K sp = [A + ] a [B - ] b Using Mg(OH) 2 as an example, our K sp expression is: Mg(OH) 2( s ) ⇢ Mg 2+ ( aq ) + 2OH - ( aq ) K sp = [Mg 2+ ][OH - ] 2 In addition, recall that there are three possible states for a solution: Understand that the K sp and Q sp expression are the same; however, the K sp defines the equilibrium point in which the solution becomes saturated (i.e., tells us how much solid can be dissolved in the solution), while the Q sp is used to describe the current state of solubility in an aqueous solution. STEP 1: First, we need to write the equilibrium reaction of PbI 2 . To write K sp (and Q sp ) expressions, you must be able to recognize how different ionic substances dissociate in water: PbI 2( s ) ⇢ Pb 2+ ( aq ) + 2 l - ( aq ) STEP 2: Next, we can write the “bare-bones” K sp (and Q sp ) expression. Recall that solids ( s ) and liquids ( l ) are not included in an equilibrium expression. K sp = [Pb 2+ ][I - ] Q sp = [Pb 2+ ][I - ] STEP 3: Then, we need to add the coefficients. Each concentration in the K sp expression (and Q sp ) is raised to the power of its coefficient in the balanced equation: PbI 2( s ) ⇢ 1 Pb 2+ ( aq ) + 2 l - ( aq ) K sp = [Pb 2+ ] 1 [I - ] 2 Q sp = [Pb 2+ ] 1 [I - ] 2 STEP 4: Next, we need to convert the [Pb 2+ ] and [I - ] from mM to M: STEP 5: Then, we need to calculate the Q sp of the solution: Q sp = [Pb 2+ ][I - ] 2 Q sp = (5 × 10 -3 )(1 × 10 -2 ) 2 Q sp = 5 × 10 -7 STEP 6: Finally, we need to compare the Q sp to the K sp to determine whether a precipitate will form. In this case, the ion product constant (Q sp ) is 5 × 10 -7 , while the solubility product constant is 7.1 × 10 -9 (given in the question) Since the Q sp > K sp , this is a supersaturated solution, and so a precipitate will form (Option C). Therefore, the answer is C .",

K 2 SO 4 is an ionic compound which dissociates into its constituent K + and SO 4 2- ions: K 2 SO 4( s ) ⇢ 2 K + ( aq ) + SO 4 2+ ( aq ) KNO 3 is also an ionic compound, which dissociates into its constituent K + and NO 3 - ions: KNO 3( s ) ⇢ K + ( aq ) + NO 3 - ( aq ) Since K 2 SO 4 and KNO 3 are dissolved in the same solution, the K + ions are common to both salts. You can conceptualize the common ion effect as an application of Le Chatelier’s principle. Adding KNO 3 to the solution increases the [K + ]. By increasing [K + ] (i.e., the product concentration), the equilibrium shifts to favor the reactants and increase [K 2 SO 4 ] and [KNO 3 ] (i.e., the reactant concentration). This means that the solubility of both compounds would decrease (Option C). Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving solubility , we will need to determine the molar solubility of AgCl ( s ) from the K sp , which is dissolved in a solution containing HCl. The solubility product constant, K sp , is the equilibrium constant for a solid substance dissolved in an aqueous solution. The K sp is a measure of solubility; the more soluble the substance is, the greater the K sp value. This is because a greater K sp value means that there is a higher concentration of ions dissolved at equilibrium. Let’s look at how to write a K sp expression. Notice that each concentration in the K sp expression is raised to the power of its coefficient in the balanced equation, and that there are no solids ( s ) or liquids ( l ) included: A a B b( s ) ⇢ aA + ( aq ) + bB - ( aq ) K sp = [A + ] a [B - ] b Using Mg(OH) 2 as an example, our K sp expression is: Mg(OH) 2( s ) ⇢ Mg 2+ ( aq ) + 2OH - ( aq ) K sp = [Mg 2+ ][OH - ] 2 As well, to solve this problem we will also need to understand the common ion effect. The common ion effect is when the solubility of an ionic precipitate is decreased by adding more of an ion that is a product in the equilibrium. STEP 1 : First, we need to write the equilibrium reaction of HCl and calculate its molarity (M). Since HCl is a strong acid, we assume 100% ionization into its constituent ions H + and Cl - . Since AgCl and HCl are dissolved in the same solution, the Cl - ions are common to both compounds, and will affect the solubility of AgCl due to the common ion effect. HCl ( aq ) ⇢ H + ( aq ) + Cl - ( aq ) STEP 2 : Then, we can write the equilibrium reaction of AgCl. To write K sp expressions, you must be able to recognize how different ionic substances dissociate in water: AgCl ( s ) ⇢ Ag + ( aq ) + Cl - ( aq ) STEP 3 : Next, we can write the “bare-bones” K sp expression. Recall that solids ( s ) and liquids ( l ) are not included in an equilibrium expression: K sp = [Ag + ][Cl - ] STEP 4 : Then, we need to add the coefficients. Each concentration in the K sp expression is raised to the power of its coefficient in the balanced equation: AgCl ( s ) ⇢ 1 Ag + ( aq ) + 1 Cl - ( aq ) K sp = [Ag + ] 1 [Cl - ] 1 STEP 5 : Next, let’s create an ICE table, leaving the AgCl column empty as it is a solid, and does not contribute to the K sp . Notice that we have an initial concentration of 0.1 M for the [Cl - ], which is due to the dissolved HCl concentration already found in the solution. AgCl ( s ) Ag + ( aq ) Cl - ( aq ) Initial concentration (M) - 0 0.1 Change (M) - + x + x Equilibrium concentration (M) - 0 + x = x 0.1 + x = 0.1 + x STEP 6 : Finally, using the K sp formula, we know that at equilibrium: K sp = (x)(x + 0.1) In this case, we are going to omit the “+ x” from the [Cl - ]. This is because the value of “x” is so small, it is negligible compared to the “0.1 M” from the HCl. This also makes our calculation easier. K sp = (x)(0.1) Since our K sp = 1.6 × 10 -10 , we can calculate the molar solubility: 1.6 × 10 -10 = (x)(0.1) x = 1.6 × 10 -9 Therefore, the answer is B .",
