As a result, the reaction shifts towards the products. Therefore, when the products are removed, the forward reaction is favored (Option D). Option A.

Removing NO 2 - is equivalent to removing products from the reaction, which shifts the equilibrium towards the right . Option C. Removing some HNO 2 Incorrect. When the concentration of HNO 2 is decreased , the concentration of the reactants is decreased. To shift the reaction back to equilibrium, the reaction shifts towards reactants, or towards the left . Option D. A dding NaNO 2 Incorrect. NaNO 2 can dissociate into Na + and NO 2 - . We can see that NO 2 - is present on the product side, so adding NaNO 2 will result in an increase in concentration of NO 2 - . This increase in concentration of products shifts the equilibrium towards the left . Option E. Decreasing the pH Incorrect. pH is a measure of the concentration of H + , where a lower pH indicates higher concentration of H + . This results in an increase in the concentration of the products which shifts the equilibrium towards the left . Therefore, the answer is B .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving Le Chatelier’s Principle , we will need to recall that this principle states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed, the system shifts to restore the equilibrium. There are several changes that can disturb equilibrium: Concentration Changes: Pressure Changes: Temperature Changes: In this case, there is a total of 9/2, or 4 and 1/2 moles of gas on the reactant side, and 2 moles of gas on the product side. Increasing the pressure (Option C) is the only answer option that favors more production of CO 2( g ) , which is on the product side, since it favors the side with fewer moles of gas. C 2 H 6( g ) + 7/2 O 2( g ) ⇌ heat + 2 CO 2( g ) + 3 H 2 O ( l ) Option A. Increasing the temperature Incorrect. In an exothermic reaction, heat is released from the reaction and is considered a product. When the temperature is increased , it has the same effect as increasing the concentration of the products. To shift the reaction back to equilibrium, the reaction shifts towards the reactants , which does not favor more production of CO 2( g ) since CO 2( g ) is a product. Option B. Adding more H 2 O (l) Incorrect. Le Chatelier’s Principle does not apply to pure solid and liquid state molecules, because they do not affect equilibrium. As a result, adding more H 2 O ( l ) does not affect the equilibrium. Option C. Increasing the pressure Correct. When the pressure is increased , there is a compression of gases. In the reaction above, there are 9/2, or 4 and 1/2 moles of gas on the reactant side, and 2 moles of gas on the product side. To shift the reaction back to equilibrium, the reaction favors the side with fewer moles of gas, which is towards the products, and therefore favors more production of CO 2( g ) Option D. Removing some O 2(g) Incorrect. When the concentration of O 2( g ) is decreased , the concentration of the reactants is decreased. To shift the reaction back to equilibrium, the reaction shifts towards the reactants , which does not favor more production of CO 2( g ) since it is a product. Option E. Adding Ar (g) to the reaction Incorrect. Inert gases are the noble gases such as He, Ne and Ar. They are unreactive and as a result do not change the position of equilibrium in the reaction. Therefore, the answer is C .",

There are several changes that can disturb equilibrium: Concentration Changes: Pressure Changes: Temperature Changes: In this case, AgNO 3 can dissociate into Ag + and NO 3 - . We can see that Ag + is present on the reactant side, so adding AgNO 3 (Option E) will result in an increase in concentration of Ag + .

Ag+ ( aq ) + Cl- ( aq ) ⇌ AgCl ( s ) ΔH o rxn = +200 kJ•mol -1 Option A. Adding KOH Incorrect. KOH can dissociate into K + and OH - . We can see that neither K + or OH - are reactants or products in the reaction. As a result, adding KOH does not affect the equilibrium. Option B. Cooling the solution Incorrect. The above reaction is endothermic because the ΔH o rxn value is positive. In an endothermic reaction, heat is required for the reaction and is considered a reactant. When the temperature is decreased , it has the same effect as decreasing the concentration of the reactants. To shift the reaction back to equilibrium, the reaction shifts towards the reverse reaction, which does not cause more AgCl ( s ) precipitate to form. Option C. Adding AgCl (s) Incorrect. Le Chatelier’s Principle does not apply to pure solid and liquid state molecules, because they do not affect equilibrium. As a result, adding more AgCl ( s ) does not affect the equilibrium. Option D. Increasing the pH Incorrect. pH is a measure of the concentration of H + , where a higher pH indicates lower concentration of H + and vice versa.

Decreasing the volume (Option B) is the only answer option that does not shift the reaction towards the reverse reaction.

Option A. Increasing the CO 2(g) concentration Incorrect. When the concentration of CO 2( g ) is increased , the concentration of the products is increased. To shift the reaction back to equilibrium, the reaction shifts towards the reverse reaction. Option B. Decreasing the total volume Correct. When the volume is decreased , there is a compression of gases. In the reaction above, there are 6 moles of gas on either side of the reaction. Since the number of moles of gas are equal , the reaction remains in equilibrium, and does not shift the reaction towards the forward or reverse reaction. Option C. Adding heat into the system Incorrect. The reaction is exothermic because the ΔH o rxn value is negative. In an exothermic reaction, heat is released from the reaction and is considered a product. When heat is added, the equilibrium will shift towards the reverse reaction to consume the heat and lower it. Option D. Increasing the temperature Incorrect. The reaction is exothermic because the ΔH o rxn value is negative. In an exothermic reaction, heat is released from the reaction and is considered a product. When the temperature is increased , it has the same effect as increasing the concentration of the products.
