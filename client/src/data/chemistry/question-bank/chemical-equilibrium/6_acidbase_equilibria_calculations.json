      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving acid-base equilibria calculation s, we will need to know the formulas involving pK w for pure water: pH + pOH = pK w K w = 10 -pKw It is important to note that the autoionization of water is an endothermic process and at greater temperatures, the equilibrium will increase formation of the products, H 3 O + and OH - . As a result, the concentrations of H 3 O + and OH - in pure water will increase as temperature increases. This then corresponds to a decrease in the pH and pOH of pure water as well. STEP 1: First, we need to know that in pure water, the concentration of hydronium molecules is equal to the concentration of hydroxide molecules. If we find the -log of both the concentration of hydronium and hydroxide ions, we find that in pure water, pH is equal to pOH. This equality is a fundamental characteristic of neutral water, where pH and pOH values are in balance: [H 3 O+] = [OH - ] -log[H 3 O + ] = -log[OH - ] pH = pOH STEP 2: Next, based on our equation from Step 1, since pH is equal to 6.75, pOH will be equal to 6.75 as well. By calculating the sum of the pH and pOH values, we can solve for the value of pK w : pH + pOH = pK w 6.75 + 6.75 = 13.5 STEP 3: Finally, we can solve for K w by plugging in pK w = 13.5 into the K w formula: K w = 10 -pKw K w = 10 -13.5 Therefore, the answer is B .",

Since x = 10 -3 is less than 5% of 0.1 M, we can assume that x is negligible in 0.1 – x , which allows us to rewrite 0.1 – x as just 0.1: Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving acid-base equilibria calculations , we need to note that one molecule of AB 2 dissociates into one molecule of A 2+ and two molecules of B - : AB 2( s ) → A 2+ ( aq ) + 2 B - ( aq ) STEP 1: First, based on the dissociation equation for AB 2 , we can set up the K sp equation for AB 2 . The equilibrium concentration of B - will have an exponent of 2 in the K sp formula. In addition, in the calculation of K sp , the concentration of solids and liquids are not included. Only aqueous and gas molecules are included in the K sp formula: K sp = [A 2+ ][B - ] 2 STEP 2: Next, we will set up an ICE table for the reaction. We can use x to quantify the amount by which the concentration of the reactants and products change from their initial value as the reaction proceeds to equilibrium. Since the coefficient of B - is 2, the final equilibrium concentration of B - will be equal to 2 x : AB 2 A2 + 2 B - Initial concentration (M) - 0 0 Change (M) - + x + 2 x Equilibrium concentration (M) - x 2x STEP 2: Next, we can plug the equilibrium concentration values into the K sp formula: K sp = ( x )(2 x ) 2 = ( x )(4 x 2 ) K sp = 4 x 3 STEP 3: Finally, since we know that the concentration of A 2+ at equilibrium is 0.1 M, we can conclude that the value of x is equal to 0.1 M and plug this value into our K sp equation: K sp = 4 x 3 K sp = 4(0.1) 3 = 4(10 -3 ) = 4 × 10 -3 Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving acid-base equilibria calculations , we will need to know the base dissociation constant (K b ) formula, which tells us the extent at which a base (B) dissociates into component ions: We will also need to know the dissociation equation for NH 3 : STEP 1: First, using the dissociation equation of NH 3 , we can plug in the product and reactants to find the K b formula for NH 3 . It is important to note that in the calculation of K b , the concentrations of solids and liquids are not included. Only aqueous and gas molecules are included in the K b formula: STEP 2: Next, we will set up an ICE table for the reaction. We can use c to represent the original concentration of NH 3 . We can also use x to quantify the amount by which the concentration of the reactants and products change from their initial value as the reaction proceeds to equilibrium: NH 3 NH 4 + OH - Initial concentration (M) c 0 0 Change (M) – x + x + x Equilibrium concentration (M) c – x x x STEP 3: Next, since we know that the percent dissociation of NH 3 was 10%, we can represent x in the ICE table in terms of c . A 10% dissociation of NH 3 means that at equilibrium, the concentration of NH 3 has decreased by 10%, and the products, NH 4 + and OH - , have increased by 10%. Therefore, x = 0.10 c : NH 3 NH 4 + OH - Initial concentration (M) c 0 0 Change (M) – 0.10 c + 0.10 c + 0.10 c Equilibrium concentration (M) 0.90 c 0.10 c 0.10 c STEP 4: Finally, we can plug in the equilibrium concentrations from our ICE table into the K b formula we found in Step 1: Next, we can multiple both sides by 0.90 to evaluate for c : Therefore, the answer is E .",
