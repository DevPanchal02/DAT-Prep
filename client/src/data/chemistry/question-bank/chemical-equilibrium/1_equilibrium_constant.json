      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving dynamic equilibrium , we will need to go over the definition of dynamic equilibrium , which is defined as the state in which the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. Although the reaction does not stop , because the two rates are equal, there is no net change in the concentrations of the reactants and products when a system is at dynamic equilibrium. In this case, it is important to recognize that it is not the concentrations of the reactants and products that are equal , but the rate of the forward and reverse reaction that is equal in dynamic equilibrium. The concentrations of reactants or products can be equal in certain cases (K eq = 1), but they are not always equal to each other (K eq > 1 or K eq < 1) in dynamic equilibrium. Keep in mind we need to find the statement that is not true of dynamic equilibrium. Option A. The rate of the forward and reverse reaction is equal Incorrect. A system is said to be in dynamic equilibrium when the rate of the forward and reverse reaction is equal. Option B. The reaction continues to occur Incorrect. When a system reaches dynamic equilibrium, the reaction does not stop but continuously occurs with the rate of reactants formed equal to the rate of products formed. Option C. There are no net changes in the concentrations of reactants or products Incorrect. When a system reaches dynamic equilibrium, the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal. This means that the rate at which the reactants are formed equals the rate at which the products are formed, resulting in no net change in the concentrations of the reactants and products. Option D. The concentrations of the reactants and products are equal Correct. The concentrations of reactants or products are not always equal in dynamic equilibrium. Concentrations of reactants or products can be equal in certain cases (K eq = 1), but they are not always equal to each other (K eq > 1 or K eq < 1). Option E. Gases are included in the equilibrium constant expression Incorrect. Gases ( g ) and aqueous solutions ( aq ) are included, but pure liquids ( l ) and pure solids ( s ) are excluded in the equilibrium constant expression. Therefore, the answer is D .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving the equilibrium constant , let’s define the equilibrium constant (K eq ) as a ratio that expresses the relationship between products and reactants of a reaction at equilibrium: It is important to recognize that the equilibrium constant expression only includes aqueous solutions ( aq ) and gases ( g ) but excludes pure liquids ( l ) and pure solids ( s ). Let’s also review the three important rules for equilibrium constant (K eq ): Option A. the rate of the forward and reverse reaction is not equal. Incorrect. It is important to recognize that at equilibrium, the rate of the forward and reverse reaction is always equal. K eq < 1 means that the rate of the forward and reverse reaction is equal, but there is a greater concentration of reactants than products at equilibrium. Option B. the formation of reactants is favored. Correct. When K eq < 1, there is greater concentration of reactants than products at equilibrium, meaning the formation of reactants is favored. You can picture this from the equilibrium constant formula – when the denominator (reactants) is greater than the numerator (products), the K eq is less than 1. Option C. the concentration of products is greater than reactants. Incorrect. When K eq < 1, the concentration of reactants is greater than products at equilibrium. When the concentration of products (numerator) is greater than reactants (denominator) at equilibrium, the K eq is greater than 1. Option D. the concentration of reactants and products are equal. Incorrect. When K eq < 1, the concentration of reactants is greater than products at equilibrium. When the concentration of products (numerator) and reactants (denominator) are equal at equilibrium, the K eq equals to 1. Option E. the reaction stops since equilibrium has been reached. Incorrect. When a system reaches equilibrium, the reaction does not stop but continuously occurs with the rate of reactants formed equal to the rate of products formed. Therefore, the answer is B .",
