Amphoteric compounds can act as both an acid and base because they have: For example, water is an amphoteric compound. Water can act as an acid since it contains hydrogen atoms that can be donated as a proton. When reacting with a base such as NH 3 , it donates a proton to form OH - and NH 4 + . H 2 O + NH 3 ⇌ OH - + NH 4 + Water also contains lone pairs on the oxygen atom that can accept a proton. When reacting with an acid such as HCl, it can accept a proton to form H 3 O + and Cl - . H 2 O + HCl ⇌ H 3 O + + Cl - In this case, the key characteristic that makes a compound amphoteric is the presence of both acidic hydrogen and basic lone pairs . Therefore, the answer is D .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving acid-base equilibria , we will need to know that the dissociation of HNO 2 can be represented as: HNO 2 + H 2 O ⇌ H 3 O + + NO 2 - To increase the pH of the solution, we need to find the change that will decrease the number of H 3 O + molecules in the solution. To do so, the equilibrium will need to shift left and produce more HNO 2 . Option A. Increasing the pressure Incorrect. Changing the pressure is unlikely to affect the direction of the dissociation, since it occurs in a liquid, and both sides of the equation have the same amount of molecules. Option B. Increasing the number of HNO 2 molecules Incorrect. Increasing the number of HNO 2 molecules will cause the equilibrium to shift right and produce more products due to Le Chatelier’s Principle. Therefore, more H 3 O + will be produced, decreasing the pH of the solution. Option C. Increasing the number of NO 2 - molecules Correct. Increasing the number of NO 2 - molecules will cause the equilibrium to shift left and produce more reactants due to Le Chatelier’s Principle. Therefore, the number of H­ 3 O + molecules will decrease, increasing the pH of the solution. Option D. Decreasing the number of OH - molecules Incorrect. Decreasing the number of OH - molecules is not relevant to the dissociation of HNO 2 since no OH - ions are produced. Therefore, this change will not increase the pH of the solution. In addition, decreasing the number of OH - molecules would decrease pH in solution. Option E. Decreasing the number of H 2 O molecules Incorrect. Decreasing the number of H 2 O molecules will have a minimal effect on the pH of the solution. This is because water typically acts as a solvent and is in large excess compared to the other aqueous compounds. Therefore, the answer is C .",

The autoionization of water yields equal hydronium and hydroxide concentrations Incorrect. The autoionization of water yields equal hydronium and hydroxide concentrations since for every hydronium ion produced, an equal number of hydroxide ions are formed. Option B. The autoionization of water is readily reversible Incorrect. The autoionization of water is readily reversible since it is an equilibrium process. The forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate to maintain a dynamic equilibrium. Option C. Water can act as both a Bronsted-Lowry acid and base Incorrect. Water can act as both a Bronsted-Lowry acid and base as it is an amphoteric compound. Water can donate a proton to act as an acid, as well as accept a proton using its lone pairs. Option D. The amount of water that autoionizes changes based on temperature Incorrect. The amount of water that autoionizes changes based on the temperature since the degree of autoionization of water is temperature dependent. As temperature increases, the autoionization constant (K w ) of water increases, indicating a greater proportion of water molecules ionize. Option E. A significant portion of water molecules undergo autoionization Correct. The proportion of water molecules that undergo autoionization is extremely small. At room temperature, the concentration of H­ 3 O + and OH - in pure water is only about 10 -7 M, which is a tiny fraction of the total concentration of water molecules. Therefore, the answer is E .",

H 2 O + H 2 O ⇌ H­ 3 O + + OH - Since the autoionization of water is an endothermic process, at greater temperatures, the equilibrium will increase formation of the products, H­ 3 O + and OH - . As a result, the concentrations of H­ 3 O + and OH - in pure water will increase as temperature increases. Based on the water dissociation constant (K w ) equation, we know that the water dissociation constant is the product of the concentrations of H­ 3 O + and OH - . Therefore, when the concentrations of H­ 3 O + and OH - increase, the water dissociation constant increases as well. K w = [H­ 3 O + ][OH - ] In this case, as temperature increases, the water dissociation constant increases, because the autoionization equilibrium shifts to produce more H­ 3 O + and OH - .

Therefore NH 4 + is not an amphoteric compound. Option B. HSO 4 - Incorrect. HSO 4 - can act as an acid by donating a proton to form SO 4 - . It can also act as a base by accepting a proton to form H 2 SO 4 using the lone pairs on the oxygen. Therefore, HSO 4 - is an amphoteric compound. Option C. H 2 O Incorrect.

NH 4 Cl is added to the solution Incorrect. If NH 4 Cl is added to the solution, NH 4 Cl will dissociate into NH 4 + and Cl - . As a result, the concentration of NH 4 + will increase and cause the NH 3 equilibrium equation to shift left. Therefore, this would reduce the number of OH - ions which will decrease the pH of the solution. Option B. A strong acid is added to the solution Incorrect. If a strong acid is added to the solution, it will dissociate to form H­ 3 O + ions. The H­ 3 O + ions will neutralize some of the OH - ions produced by NH 3 , reducing the number of OH - ions which will decrease the pH of the solution. Either way, adding a strong acid is bound to decrease the pH of any solution. Option C. The temperature of the solution is decreased Incorrect. Since we know that the enthalpy of the reaction is positive ( DH rxn = 250 kJ•mol -1 ), we can rewrite the equation, making “heat” as a reactant: NH 3 + H 2 O + heat → NH 4 + + OH - . If the temperature is decreased, the reaction will try to compensate by producing more heat, which it can do by shifting the reaction to the left. As a result, this will decrease the number of OH - ions, decreasing the pH of the solution. Option D. NH 3 is removed from the solution Incorrect.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving acid-base equilibria , we will need to know that since HBr is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate to form hydronium (H­ 3 O + ) and bromine ions: HBr + H 2 O → H­ 3 O + + Br - As seen in the dissociation of HBr, the addition of HBr will increase the concentration of H­ 3 O + ions. As a result, the H­ 3 O + ions will react with the OH - ions formed in the equilibrium of NH 3 and produce water, effectively reducing the concentration of OH - ions. To counteract this change, according to Le Chatelier’s Principle, the equilibrium will shift to the right to produce more NH 4 + and OH - . NH 3 + H 2 O ⇌ NH 4 + + OH - In this case, if HBr is added to a solution containing NH 3 at equilibrium, the equilibrium of NH 3 will shift right, due to a decrease in OH - ions . Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving acid-base equilibria , we will need to know that as temperature increases, the dissociation constant of water (K w ) increases as well. This is because the autoionization of water is an endothermic process, so at higher temperatures, the equilibrium favors the formation of more H­ 3 O + and OH - ions. Consequently, as the concentrations of these ions increase with temperature, the water dissociation constant (K w ), which is the product of the concentrations of H­ 3 O + and OH - , also increases. K w = [H­ 3 O + ][OH - ] Since the internal body temperature of 37 o C is greater than room temperature, which is 25 o C, the dissociation constant of water (K w ) is greater in the human body compared to room temperature. K w is also the product of K a and K b . If K w is greater in the human body, the K a and K b values will be greater in the human body compared to room temperature. K w = (K a )(K b ) In this case, both K a and K b values of water is greater in the human body compared to room temperature. Since the values of K a and K b of water is greater in the human body, the sum of the pK a and pK b will no longer be 14, nor will the product of K a and K b be equal to 10 -14 (as it usually is at room temperature). Therefore, the answer is B .",

As a result, the pH of the solution will increase as more of the H­ 3 O + ions are neutralized. To restore the changes caused by the LiOH, we will need to shift the C 6 H 5 COOH equilibrium equation to the right to produce more H­ 3 O + ions and decrease the pH. Out of the given options, removing C 6 H 5 COO - will cause the equilibrium to shift to the right and produce more C 6 H 5 COO - H­ 3 O + ions. The increase in H­ 3 O + ions can help decrease the pH and restore the original pH of the solution. In this case, removing C 6 H 5 COO - from the solution will help restore the original pH of the solution. Therefore, the answer is D .",
