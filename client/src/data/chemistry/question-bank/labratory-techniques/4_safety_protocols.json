This is a safe laboratory practice, because broken glass should be disposed of in designated broken glass containers. Option B. Using the fire extinguisher on solvent fires. Incorrect. This is a safe laboratory practice, because fire extinguishers should be used to extinguish solvent or electrical fires. Option C. Pouring concentrated acid into water. Incorrect. This is a safe laboratory practice because concentrated acid should always be added to water. On the other hand, adding water to concentrated acid causes a highly exothermic reaction that results in violent boiling and splashing. Option D. Flushing water immiscible solutions down the drain. Correct. This is not a safe laboratory practice, because water immiscible solutions (ex: organic chemicals) should be disposed of in proper waste containers. Only water miscible solutions (ex: acids, alkalis) should be flushed down the drain with copious amounts of water. Option E. Using the fume hood to minimize vapor exposure. Incorrect. This is a safe laboratory practice, because the fume hood provides proper ventilation and minimizes one’s exposure to harmful vapors and fumes. Therefore, the answer is D .",

Water at the eyewash station is used to treat any splashes of chemicals (acids, bases, etc.) in or near the eyes by 20 minutes of rinsing. Option B. Weak acids to neutralize the solution Incorrect. Weak acids, or any other chemical, should not be used to neutralize strong bases in a student’s eyes. Option C. Alcohol to wash off the base Incorrect. Alcohol is not used to wash off strong bases in a student’s eyes. Option D. Wet towel to cover the eyes Incorrect. A wet towel to cover the eyes would likely trap the strong base in the student’s eyes, making the problem worse. Option E. Water at the safety shower Incorrect. Because the splash area is limited to the student’s eyes, using water at the eyewash station is preferred over the safety shower, which is for larger areas of exposure. However, if an eyewash station is not available, the safety shower is the next best option. Therefore, the answer is A .",
