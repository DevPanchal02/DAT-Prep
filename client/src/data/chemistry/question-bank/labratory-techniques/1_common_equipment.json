Although beakers have a spout that facilitates pouring, they are not designed to dispense fluids slowly and consistently. Option B. Erlenmeyer flask Incorrect. Although some Erlenmeyer flasks have a spout that facilitates pouring, they are not designed to dispense fluids slowly and consistently. Option C. Graduated cylinder Incorrect. Although graduated cylinders have a spout that facilitates pouring, they are not designed to dispense fluids slowly and consistently. Option D. Burette Correct. Burettes are designed with a valve that controls the flow of liquid, allowing the user to dispense fluids slowly and consistently during titrations. Option E. Test tube Incorrect. Test tubes are not designed to dispense fluids slowly and consistently. Therefore, the answer is D .",
