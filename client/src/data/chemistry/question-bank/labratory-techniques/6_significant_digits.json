      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving significant digits , which is the number of digits that contribute to the degree of accuracy of a measurement, let’s first review the rules of significant digits: In addition, we can review the operation rules of significant digits: To find the mass of 20 capsules, we multiply the mass in one capsule by 20. Since this involves multiplication , we need to pay attention to the number of significant digits for each number. STEP 1 : First, we identify the fact that 1.25 has 3 non-zero numbers that are significant ( 1 . 25 ), so 1.25 has 3 significant digits. STEP 2 : Next, we identify the fact that 20 is an exact number (it is not a measurement). This implies that it has an infinite number of significant digits, so it will never be the limiting term. STEP 3 : To calculate the grams of creatine found in 20 capsules, we multiply 20 × 1.25 = 25.0 and round this to the same number of significant digits as the limiting term. Since 1.25 has 3 significant digits, it is the limiting term. Our final answer, 25.0 already has 3 significant digits, so we do not need to change it. Therefore, the answer is B . Note : Option A is incorrect, because 25 implies that our answer only has 2 significant digits, when in fact, we need 3 significant digits since our limiting term has 3 significant digits.",

Since this involves division , we need to pay attention to the number of significant digits for each number. STEP 1 : First, we identify the fact that 3,600 has 2 non-zero numbers that are significant ( 3 , 6 00), so 3,600 has 2 significant digits. STEP 2 : Next, we identify the fact that 6 is an exact number (it is not a measurement). This implies that it has an infinite number of significant digits, so it will never be the limiting term. STEP 3 : To calculate the milliliters each student should receive, we divide 3,600 ÷ 6 = 600 and round this to the same number of significant digits as the limiting term. Since 3,600 has 2 significant digits, it is the limiting term. Of the answer choices, only Option C (6.0 × 10 2 ), correctly expresses 600 to 2 significant digits. Therefore, the answer is C. Note : Option A (600 mL) has 1 significant digit, Option B (600. mL) has 3 significant digits, Option D (6.00 × 10 2 mL) has 3 significant digits, and Option E (6.000 × 10 2 mL) has 4 significant digits.",
