      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving meniscuses , we will go over some properties that affect the shape of the meniscus. To begin, there are two shapes for the meniscus: Whether a liquid appears concave or convex depends on whether the liquid inside the container is more strongly attracted to the container or the other liquid molecules. Water, for example, appears concave because the adhesive forces of water molecules to the container are stronger than the cohesive forces between the water molecules themselves. The opposite is true for a convex meniscus. In a convex meniscus, the cohesive forces between the water molecules themselves are stronger than the adhesive forces of water molecules to the container. This is why intermolecular forces are most likely to affect the general shape of the meniscus. Therefore, the answer is B .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving reading volumes , we must remember that burettes use a reverse numbering system, which means that the volumetric markings begin with “0” at the top, and the numbers increase as we move down the burette. In this case, we know that the original volume inside the 100.0 mL burette before the titration was 90.0 mL. Since only 90.0 mL of the 100.0 mL burette was filled, the starting reading of the burette was 100.0 – 90.0 = 10.0 mL. This implies that 10.0 mL was absent from the burette. After titration, which is depicted in the diagram above, the lowest point of the concave meniscus reads 27.0 mL. Since there is a 27.0 – 10.0 = 17.0 mL difference between the two values, 17.0 mL was dispensed from the burette. Therefore, the answer is A .",
