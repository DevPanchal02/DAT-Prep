We can conclude that either x = 210 or x = 190. The experimenter either poured too much liquid (210 mL) or too little liquid (190 mL). Because the question does not specify which occurred, we select 190 mL (Option A), which is the only one of the two possible answers available. Therefore, the answer is A",

Random Errors are errors that are skewed in either direction – both above and below the true value, and to a different extent each time. They are usually caused by human error and inconsistent methods (ex: misreading glassware, reaction times when using a stopwatch). Option A. Using a stopwatch to measure time. Incorrect. This is an error that can vary measurements in either direction with different magnitudes (stopping too early or late), and is due to human limitations, so it is a random error . Option B. An improperly calibrated pH meter. Correct. A pH calibration adjusts a pH meter by measuring solutions of a known pH value. If the pH meter is improperly calibrated, it will consistently shift all readings either too high or low. We can say this is a systematic error . Option C. Solute stuck on the walls of a flask. Incorrect. This is an error that will result in a random amount of solute being left unused, and is due to human limitations. We can say this is a random error . Option D. Fluctuation of the power supply on a balance. Incorrect. This is an error that can vary measurements randomly in either direction with different magnitudes. We can say that this is a random error . Option E. Overshooting an acid-base titration. Incorrect. This is an error that will result in a random, excessive amount of titrant being used. We can say this is a random error .

Random Errors are errors that are skewed in either direction – both above and below the true value, and to a different extent each time. They are usually caused by human error and inconsistent methods (ex: misreading glassware, reaction times when using a stopwatch). In this case, the assumption is that we are only interested in the weight of the glucose samples. However, forgetting to tare the scale will result in the weight of the beaker being included towards the final measurement. Because the additional weight of the beaker consistently skews each measurement higher, forgetting to tare the scale is a systematic error . Therefore, the answer is A .",

Random Errors are errors that are skewed in either direction – both above and below the true value, and to a different extent each time. They are usually caused by human error and inconsistent methods (ex: misreading glassware, reaction times when using a stopwatch). An experimental protocol that involves timing with a stopwatch introduces random errors , because there are human limitations with reaction times (stopping the stopwatch too early or late). In this case, having multiple students take the measurement and then taking their average reduces the random effect of reaction times, which thereby reduces random error .

They are usually caused by human error and inconsistent methods (ex: misreading glassware, reaction times when using a stopwatch). In this case, pH Meter 1’s measurements are mostly consistent with the pH of 8.2 used to test the two pH meters. However, pH Meter 2’s measurements appear consistently lower than pH Meter 1’s measurements. This implies that pH Meter 2 has higher systematic error , likely due to improper calibration of the pH meter (the higher in this case refers to a higher level of systematic error, not the numerical difference between the two pH meters).
