In this case, we are told that the student forgot to tare the weigh scale. Taring the weigh scale (setting the initial balance to 0) is essential to ensuring that only the weight of the sample is taken. Because our student forgot to tare the scale, we can expect that the measurements are inaccurate . On the other hand, the measurements of the 6.50 g sample are within 0.02 g of one another, so we can say that the measurements are precise . Therefore, the answer is B .",

Option A. Correctly calculating the mass of aluminum to be 75 grams. Incorrect. Although this implies that the calculated mass is close to the true value, this indicates high accuracy , not high precision. To determine precision, we require multiple data points. Option B. Accidentally using sugar instead of salt for an experiment. Incorrect. Because the intention was to use salt, not sugar, this indicates a mistake, and has no implications on precision. Option C. Readings for a classroom thermometer showing 70 o F each day for the past month. Correct. Although we do not know the classroom’s true temperature, a consistent reading of 70 o F each day for an entire month indicates high precision . Option D. Reading the lowest point of the meniscus in a graduated cylinder with water. Incorrect. Although it is good practice to read the lowest point of the meniscus in a graduated cylinder with water, this indicates high accuracy , not high precision. To determine precision, we require multiple data points. Option E. Taring the weigh scale for only half of the experiment’s measurements. Incorrect.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving accuracy vs. precision , let’s first define the two properties: Accuracy describes the overall closeness of experimental values to the true literature value. If a set of data is accurate, that means the experimental values are grouped around the true value. Precision describes the overall consistency of experimental values. If a set of data is precise, that means the experimental values are grouped closely to each other, but not necessarily around the true value. Accuracy and precision are independent of one another. In this case, we are told that the measured weight is 65 g, while the true weight is 80 g. This allows us to conclude that the scale is not accurate , since there is a significant difference between the experimental and true value. Only one measurement was taken, so we cannot make any conclusions about the scale’s precision. This is because precision measures how close multiple measurements are to each other. Therefore, the answer is C .",

In this case, the enthalpy measurements of –24.2, –24.4, and –24.3 kJ are grouped closely together, which implies that the readings are precise .
