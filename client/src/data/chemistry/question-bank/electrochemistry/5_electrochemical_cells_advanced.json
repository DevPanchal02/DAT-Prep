      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving electrochemical cells , we need to understand the importance of a salt bridge/porous barrier. A salt bridge is used in voltaic cells, whereas a porous barrier is used in electrolytic cells. A salt bridge is a tube filled with nonreactive electrolytes, including examples such as NaNO 3 and KNO 3 . Because atoms are oxidized in the anode, resulting in the loss of electrons, positive ions build up within the aqueous solution. The anions in the salt bridge will flow towards the anode to balance this. Meanwhile, atoms are reduced at the cathode, resulting in the gain of electrons and loss of positive ions in the aqueous solution. The cations in the salt bridge will flow towards the cathode to balance this. As electrons move from the anode to the cathode, we can see that charges build up on both sides of the cell. The salt bridge maintains the movement of ions between the two half-cells, ensuring a balance in these charges. The porous barrier in electrolytic cells serve a very similar purpose, selectively allowing the movement of ions between the two-half cells to balance charges. In this case, the importance of having a salt bridge/porous barrier in an electrochemical cell is to maintain electrical neutrality in the half-cells via the migration of ions . Therefore, the answer is A .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving electrochemical cells , we need to know the types of ions used in a salt bridge. A salt bridge is used to maintain electrical neutrality within the half-cells. The bridge is filled with non-reaction electrolytes, including examples such as NaNO 3 and KNO 3 . The reason these molecules are helpful in the salt bridge is because they dissociate into a pair of anions and cations, which can flow to maintain a balance of charges: NaNO 3( s ) → Na + ( aq ) + NO 3 - ( aq ) KNO 3( s ) → K + ( aq ) + NO 3 - ( aq ) Therefore, the pair of molecules that can be used to facilitate ion flow between the two half-cells in a galvanic cell is Na + and NO 3 - . The other options do not offer a pair of anions and cations. Therefore, the answer is B .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving electrochemical cell s, we need to know the electroplating process. Electroplating is the process of plating a metal onto another, covering it with a thin layer. The anode (containing the metal needed for plating) and cathode (containing the item to be plated) are both submerged in a solution containing a dissolved metal salt. At the anode, the oxidation of ions occurs, causing solid atoms to lose electrons and become aqueous ions in the shared solution. At the cathode, the reduction of ions occurs, causing the aforementioned aqueous ions to gain electrons and become solid. These solid atoms then deposit onto the cathode, resulting in a gain in mass and the electroplating of the cathode. There is an overall loss of mass at the anode and a gain of mass at the cathode. In this case, at the cathode, metal ions are reduced, forming a plated layer . Therefore, the answer is B .",
