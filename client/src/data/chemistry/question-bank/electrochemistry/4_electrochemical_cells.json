Anions in the salt bridge flow towards the anode because at the anode, oxidation occurs, which results in an increase of positive charge. The flow of anions helps neutralize this extra positive charge. Therefore, all the statements are true regarding voltaic (galvanic) cells except for “ anions in the salt bridge flow towards the cathode ” – anions in the salt bridge flow towards the anode instead. Keep in mind that we are looking for an incorrect statement about voltaic cells. Option A. Redox reactions are spontaneous Incorrect. Voltaic cells involve spontaneous redox reactions that generate electrical energy. Option B. The anode is oxidized Incorrect. In a voltaic cell, the anode undergoes oxidation, releasing electrons. This increases the amount of positive charge without the solution. Option C. Current is produced by the transfer of electrons Incorrect. In a voltaic cell, electrons flow from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit, producing an electric current. Option D. Anions in the salt bridge flow towards the cathode Correct. In a voltaic cell, the salt bridge contains ions that flow to balance the charges in the half-cells. Anions in the salt bridge flow towards the anode because at the anode, oxidation occurs, which results in an increase of positive charge in the solution that the anode is immersed in. The flow of anions helps neutralize this positive charge. Meanwhile, in the cathode, positive charge is lost in the solution as the cathode undergoes reduction. This means that cations in the salt bridge flows towards the cathode, in order to balance out the lost positive charge. It is easier to logically reason out which ions flow towards which direction, instead of memorizing by heart! Option E. Voltaic cells are composed of two separated half-cells Incorrect. Voltaic cells consist of two half-cells, each containing an electrolyte and an electrode. The half-cells are separated physically but connected via a salt bridge. Therefore, the answer is D .",

For both voltaic and electrolytic cells, the electrons flow from the anode to the cathode. Keep in mind that we are looking for an incorrect statement about electrolytic cells. Option A. The anode is positive Incorrect. In an electrolytic cell, the anode is positively charged. Meanwhile, the anode is negatively charged for a galvanic cell. Option B. The cell is nonspontaneous Incorrect. The cell is nonspontaneous, meaning that it requires an external source of electrical energy to drive the nonspontaneous redox reaction. Meanwhile, galvanic cells are spontaneous. Option C. The cathode is the site of reduction Incorrect. In an electrolytic cell, the cathode is the electrode where reduction occurs. In fact, the cathode is always the site of reduction, whether it is a galvanic cell or electrolytic cell. Option D. The cathode gains mass Incorrect. During the electroplating process, the metal being plated by the other metal is made into the cathode. At the cathode, the reduction of ions occurs, causing aqueous ions to transform into solid atoms. These solid atoms then deposit onto the cathode, resulting in a gain in mass and electroplating. At the anode, the opposite happens. Solid atoms on the anode oxidize and enter the solution, leading to the dissolution of the anode. This results in a loss of mass for the anode. Option E.

Electroplating is the process of plating a metal onto another, covering it with a thin layer. The anode (containing the metal needed for plating) and cathode (containing the item to be plated) are both submerged in a solution containing a dissolved metal salt. At the anode, the oxidation of ions occurs, causing solid atoms to lose electrons and become aqueous ions in the shared solution. At the cathode, the reduction of ions occurs, causing the aforementioned aqueous ions to gain electrons and become solid. These solid atoms then deposit onto the cathode, resulting in a gain in mass and the electroplating of the cathode. There is an overall loss of mass at the anode and a gain of mass at the cathode. In this case, the cathode is typically plated in an electrolytic cell. Therefore, the answer is D .",

It requires an external force to drive the reaction against its natural tendency. In this case, the role of the power source in an electrolytic cell is that it forces electrons to flow non-spontaneously . Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving electrochemical cells , we need to know what happens at both the anode and the cathode of electrolytic cells: Galvanic (voltaic) cells (E° cell > 0) Electrolytic cells (E° cell < 0) Spontaneous redox reactions (ΔG < 0) Nonspontaneous redox reactions (ΔG > 0) Electrons flows from negatively-charged anode to positively-charged cathode Electrons flow from positively-charged anode to negatively-charged cathode Converts chemical to electrical energy Converts electrical to chemistry energy Does not require an external power source Requires an external power source Recall that oxidation always occurs at the anode and reduction always occurs at the cathode, regardless of the cell type. Because we are told that we are interested in a reduction , this allows us to narrow our answer choice to only answer choices A and C. Recall that in an electrolytic cell, the cathode is negatively charged. Therefore, we can say that, in an electrolytic cell, reduction takes place at the negatively charged cathode . Therefore, the answer is A .",
