This allows us to formulate this equation for Zn(OH) 4 2- : x + (-2 + 1)4 = -2 STEP 2: Next, we solve for x , which is the oxidation number of Zn: x + (-1)4 = -2 x – 4 = -2 x = -2 + 4 = +2 As we can see, Zn has an oxidation number of +2 .

STEP 2: Next, we determine the oxidation number of both monatomic Cu and Mg as 0 (Rule 1). STEP 3: Next, we determine the oxidation numbers for each atom in CuSO 4 . We can assign O an oxidation number of -2 (Rule 3). To determine the oxidation number of S, recall that SO 4 usually appears as an ion SO 4 2- . According to Rule 5, S would have an oxidation number of +6 in this case, so that the final charge of the molecule is -2. Consequently, Cu must have an oxidation number of +2 in CuSO 4 . STEP 4: Finally, we can identify the oxidizing agent. Remember that the oxidizing agent is the molecule that is reduced , and the reducing agent is the molecule that is oxidized . This means we need to identify the molecule that is reduced, which is MgSO 4 , because the oxidation state of Mg changes from +2 to 0. MgSO 4 is an oxidizing agent because it oxidizes Cu .

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving oxidation numbers , we will go over the 5 rules to determine the oxidation state and number: STEP 1: First, we assign K an oxidation number of +1 because it is an alkali metal (Rule 4). STEP 2: Next, we can determine that if K has an oxidation number of +1, Cr 2 O 7 has an oxidation number of -2. It can be re-written as Cr 2 O 7 2- . STEP 3: Next, we can assign O an oxidation number of -2 (Rule 3). Since it has an oxidation number of -2, O 7 has a collective oxidation of 7(-2) = -14. This means that Cr 2 must have a collective oxidation of +12, so that Cr 2 O 7 2- has a collective charge of -2. This means that each Cr has an oxidation number of +6. We can conclude that the oxidation numbers are K = +1, Cr = +6, O = -2 . Therefore, the answer is E .",

STEP 2: Next, we determine that in H 2 O 2 , O has an oxidation number of -1, and H has an oxidation number of +1. STEP 3: Next, we determine that in NaOH, Na has an oxidation number of +1 (Rule 4), O has an oxidation number of -2 (Rule 3), and H has an oxidation number of +1 (Rule 3). STEP 4: Finally, we determine that Cl in Cl 2 has an oxidation number of 0 (Rule 1). Keep in mind that we need to look for the incorrect statement. Option A. H is reduced Correct. The oxidation number of H remains unchanged, so this is not true. Option B. Na has a +1 oxidation state Incorrect. The oxidation number of Na is +1. Option C. NaCl is a reducing agent Incorrect. Reducing agents are oxidized themselves. The oxidation number of Cl changes from -1 to 0, which shows that it is oxidized, making NaCl a reducing agent. Option D. H 2 O 2 is an oxidizing agent Incorrect. Oxidizing agents are reduced themselves. The oxidation number of O changes from -1 to -2, which shows that it is reduced, making H 2 O 2 an oxidizing agent. Option E. Cl 2 has an oxidation state of 0 Incorrect. Cl 2 has an oxidation number of 0. Therefore, the answer is A .",

In NaClO 2 , Na has an oxidation number of +1 (Rule 4), O has an oxidation number of -2 (Rule 3), so Cl must have an oxidation number of +3 (Rule 5). Option C. Mg(ClO 4 ) 2 Correct.
