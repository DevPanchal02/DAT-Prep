      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving balancing basic redox reactions , we will follow the steps below: STEP 1: First, we write down the half-reactions: (1) Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ (2) ClO 4 - →  Cl - STEP 2: Next, we balance all the atoms in the equation other than O and H. We can skip this step since Fe and Cl are already balanced in both half-reactions. STEP 3: Next, we balance the oxygen atoms by adding the same number of H 2 O molecules to the opposite side of the reaction. In (2), we have 4 O on the left side, so we add 4 H 2 O on the right: (1) Fe 2+ →  Fe 3+ (2) ClO 4 - → Cl - + 4 H 2 O STEP 4: Next, we balance the hydrogen atoms by adding H + ions to the opposite side of the reaction. In (2), we have 8 H on the right side, and none on the left, so we add 8 H + on the left: (1) Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H + →  Cl - + 4 H 2 O STEP 5: Next, because this is a basic solution, we will add an OH - on both sides of the equation for each H + added. In (2), because we previously added 8 H + , we add 8 OH - on both sides: (1) Fe 2+ →  Fe 3+ (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H + + 8 OH - →  Cl - + 4 H 2 O + 8 OH - STEP 6: Next, we will combine the H + and OH - to create H 2 O (only possible on the left side): (1) Fe 2+ →  Fe 3+ (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H 2 O →  Cl - + 4 H 2 O + 8 OH - STEP 7: Next, we determine if the charges on both sides are the same. If not, we add e - to the more positive side to balance the charges on both sides. In (1), there is a +2 charge on the left and +3 on the right, so we add 1 e - on the right side so both sides have a charge of +2. In (2), there is a -1 charge on the left and a -1 – 8 = -9 charge on the right, so we will add 8 e - on the left so both sides have a charge of -9: (1) Fe 2+ →  Fe 3+ + e - (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H 2 O + 8 e - →  Cl - + 4 H 2 O + 8 OH - STEP 8: Next, we must ensure that the number of e - in both half reactions must be the same. If not, we multiply the whole equation by appropriate integers. In (2), there are 8 e - transferred, but in (1), there is only 1 e - transferred, so we multiply (1) by 8 so both sides involve the transfer of 8 e - : (1) 8 Fe 2+ → 8 Fe 3+ + 8 e - (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H 2 O + 8 e - →  Cl - + 4 H 2 O + 8 OH - STEP 9: Finally, the half reactions are added together. Electrons and common terms should be cancelled out to form the balanced equation: 8 Fe 2+ + ClO 4 - + 8 H 2 O + 8 e - →  8 Fe 3+ + 8 e - + Cl - + 4 H 2 O + 8 OH - 8 Fe 2+ + ClO 4 - + 4 H 2 O  →  8 Fe 3+ + Cl - + 8 OH - As we can see, 8 iron atoms can be found on each side after balancing our redox reaction in basic conditions. Therefore, the answer is C .",

To make the e - balanced, we multiply (1) by 2 and (2) by 5 so both reactions involve the transfer of 10 e - : (1) 2  MnO 4 - + 16 H 2 O+ 10 e - → 2 Mn 2+ + 8 H 2 O + 16 OH - (2) 5 H 2 O 2 + 10 OH - → 5 O 2 + 10 H 2 O + 10 e - As we can see, 10 electrons are transferred in our redox reaction in basic conditions. At this point, we can select Option B. For demonstration purposes, we will finish balancing the redox reaction in basic conditions. STEP 9: Finally, the half reactions are added together. Electrons and common terms should be cancelled out to form the balanced equation: 2  MnO 4 - + 16 H 2 O + 10 e - + 5 H 2 O 2 + 10 OH - → 2 Mn 2+ + 8 H 2 O + 16 OH - + 5 O 2 + 10 H 2 O + 10 e - 2  MnO 4 - + 5 H 2 O 2 → 2 Mn 2+ + 2 H 2 O + 5 O 2 + 6 OH - Therefore, the answer is B .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving balancing basic redox reactions , we will follow the steps below: STEP 1: First, we write down the half-reactions: (1) Cr(OH) 3 → CrO 4 2- (2) ClO 4 - →Cl - STEP 2: Next, we balance all the atoms in the equation other than O and H. We can skip this step since both Cr and Cl are already balanced in both half-reactions. STEP 3: Next, we balance the oxygen atoms by adding the same number of H 2 O molecules to the opposite side of the reaction. In (1), we have 3 O on the left side, and 4 O on the right side, so we add 1 H 2 O on the left side. In (2), we have 4 O on the left side, and none on the right, so we add 4 H 2 O on the right: (1) Cr(OH) 3 + H 2 O → CrO 4 2- (2) ClO 4 - → Cl - + 4 H 2 O STEP 4: Next, we balance the hydrogen atoms by adding H + ions to the opposite side of the reaction. In (1), we have 5 H on the left, and none on the right, so we add 5 H + on the right. In (2), we have 8 H on the right, and none on the left so we add 8 H + on the left: (1) Cr(OH) 3 + H 2 O → CrO 4 2- + 5 H + (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H + → Cl - + 4 H 2 O STEP 5: Next, because this is a basic solution, we will add an OH - on both sides of the equation for each H + added. In (1), we previously added 5 H + , so now we add 5 OH - on both sides. In (2), we previously added 8 H + , so now we add 8 OH - on both sides: (1) Cr(OH) 3 + H 2 O + 5 OH - → CrO 4 2- + 5 H + + 5 OH - (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H + + 8 OH - → Cl - + 4 H 2 O + 8 OH - STEP 6: Next, we will combine the H + and OH - to create H 2 O: (1) Cr(OH) 3 + H 2 O + 5 OH - → CrO 4 2- + 5 H 2 O (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H 2 O → Cl - + 4 H 2 O + 8 OH - STEP 7: Next, we determine if the charges on both sides are the same. If not, we add e - to the more positive side to balance the charges on both sides. N (1), there is a -5 charge on the left, and a -2 charge on the right, so we add 3 e - on the right so that both sides have a charge of -5: In (2), there is a -1 charge on the left, and a -1 – 8 = -9 charge on the right, so we add 8 e - on the left so that both sides have a charge of -9: (1) Cr(OH) 3 + H 2 O + 5 OH - → CrO 4 2- + 5 H 2 O + 3 e - (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H 2 O + 8 e - → Cl - + 4 H 2 O + 8 OH - STEP 8: Next, we must ensure that the number of e - in both half reactions must be the same.

At this point, we can select Option E. For demonstration purposes, we will finish balancing the redox reaction in basic conditions. STEP 9: Finally, the half reactions are added together.

Since there are 2 Cr on the left but only 1 Cr on the right, we multiply Cr 3+ by 2: (1) Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ (2) Cr 2 O 7 2- → 2 Cr 3+ STEP 3: Next, we balance the oxygen atoms by adding the same number of H 2 O molecules to the opposite side of the reaction. In (2), we have 7 O on the left side, and none on the right, so we add 7 H 2 O on the left: (1) Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ (2) Cr 2 O 7 2- → 2 Cr 3+ + 7 H 2 O STEP 4: Next, we balance the hydrogen atoms by adding H + ions to the opposite side of the reaction. In (2), we have no H on the left, and 14 on the right, so we add 14 H + on the left: (1) Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ (2) Cr 2 O 7 2- + 14 H + → 2 Cr 3+ + 7 H 2 O STEP 5: Next, because this is a basic solution, we will add an OH - on both sides of the equation for each H + added. In (2), since we previously added 14 H + , we must add 14 OH - on both sides: (1) Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ (2) Cr 2 O 7 2- + 14 H + + 14 OH - → 2 Cr 3+ + 7 H 2 O + 14 OH - STEP 6: Next, we will combine the H + and OH - to create H 2 O (only possible on the left): (1) Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ (2) Cr 2 O 7 2- + 14 H 2 O → 2 Cr 3+ + 7 H 2 O + 14 OH - STEP 7: Next, we determine if the charges on both sides are the same. If not, we add e - to the more positive side to balance the charges on both sides. In (1), there is a +2 charge on the left, and a +3 charge on the right, so we add 1 e - on the right so that there is a charge of +2 on both sides. In (2), there is a -2 charge on the left, and a 2(+3) – 14 = -8 charge on the right, so we add 6 e - on the left so that both sides have a charge of -8: (1) Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ + e - (2) Cr 2 O 7 2- + 14 H 2 O + 6 e - → 2 Cr 3+ + 7 H 2 O + 14 OH - STEP 8: Next, we must ensure that the number of e - in both half reactions must be the same. If not, we multiply the whole equation by appropriate integers. In (2), there are 6 e - transferred, but in (1), there is only 1 e - transferred. To make the e - balanced, we multiply (1) by 6 so both reactions involve the transfer of 6 e - : (1) 6 Fe 2+ → 6 Fe 3+ + 6 e - (2) Cr 2 O 7 2- + 14 H 2 O + 6 e - → 2 Cr 3+ + 7 H 2 O + 14 OH - STEP 9: Finally, the half reactions are added together. Electrons and common terms should be cancelled out to form the balanced equation: 6 Fe 2+ + Cr 2 O 7 2- + 14 H 2 O + 6 e - → 6 Fe 3+ + 6 e - + 2 Cr 3+ + 7 H 2 O + 14 OH - 6 Fe 2+ + Cr 2 O 7 2- + 7 H 2 O → 6 Fe 3+ + 2 Cr 3+ + 14 OH - As we can see, the sum of all the coefficients is 6 + 1 + 7 + 6 + 2 + 14 = 36 after balancing our redox reaction in basic conditions. Therefore, the answer is D .",
