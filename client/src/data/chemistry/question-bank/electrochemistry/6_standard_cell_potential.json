STEP 2: Then, we can examine the half-reactions that are provided to us for aluminum and manganese to determine which element is oxidized and which element is reduced. For our electrolytic cell, we know that the E° cell < 0. As a result, manganese must be oxidized since it has a less negative reduction potential. Since our E° reduction = -1.18 V, we can calculate the E° oxidation : E° oxidation = -E° reduction E° oxidation = - (-1.18 V) E° oxidation = +1.18 V STEP 3: F inally, we can use the formula to determine E° cell : E° cell = E° reduction + E° oxidation E° cell = -1.66 V + 1.18 V E° cell = -0.48 V As we can see, our final result is a negative value for E° cell , which means that this is indeed an electrolytic cell. If our final result was a positive value, this would mean that we calculated the standard cell potential for a galvanic cell instead. This is a good way to verify our calculations.

E° cell = E° reduction + E° oxidation In this case, recall that in cell notation, a vertical line, |, represents a physical boundary, while a double line, ‖, a porous barrier. The anode electrode ( s ) is written to the left, followed by the anode solution ( aq ) .

Recall that an oxidizing agent is reduced, so to find the strongest oxidizing agent, you must find the molecule with the highest reduction potential. An oxidizing agent increases in strength as the reduction potential (E° reduction ) becomes more positive. The more positive the reduction potential, the greater the species’ affinity for electrons and tendency to be reduced. In contrast, a reducing agent increases in strength as the reduction potential (E° reduction ) becomes more negative. The more negative the reduction potential, the greater the species’ willingness to donate its electrons to be oxidized. In this case, we are looking for the strongest oxidizing agent.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving electrochemical cells , we will need to determine which of the statements is false. The standard cell potential (E° cell ) is the sum of the reduction potential and oxidation potential in their standard states, measured in volts (V). E° cell = E° reduction + E° oxidation Understand that the questions specifies that the scientist is working with a cell that does not require an external power source. This indicates that the scientist is working with a voltaic (galvanic) cell, since the electrons flow spontaneously. In this case, since the electrons flow spontaneously, this cell has a negative Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG < 0). This means that each statement is correct, except “This cell has a positive Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG)” . Keep in mind we need to find the incorrect statement regarding this electrochemical cell. Option A. The standard cell potential of this cell is +1.1 V Incorrect. The E° cell = 0.76 V + 0.34 V = +1.1 V (recall that E° oxidation = -E° reduction , so the E° oxidation of Zn is +0.76 V). Since this cell does not require an external power source (i.e., is a galvanic cell), the E° cell must be positive. Option B. The reaction that takes place at the cathode is Cu 2+ + 2e - → Cu Incorrect. Since this cell does not require an external power source (i.e., is a galvanic cell), the E° cell must be positive. This means that copper (Cu) is reduced, while zinc (Zn) is oxidized. Recall that for all cells, oxidation always occurs at the anode, while reduction always occurs at the cathode. If it were the opposite, and copper was oxidized and zinc was reduced, our E° cell value would be negative, which would then require an external power source. Option C. This cell has a positive Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) Correct. Since this cell does not require an external power source (i.e., is a galvanic cell), the E° cell must be positive. This means that the electrons flow spontaneously, and the cell has a Gibbs Free Energy ΔG < 0. Option D. The reaction that takes place at the anode is Zn → Zn 2+ + 2e - Incorrect. Since this cell does not require an external power source (i.e., is a galvanic cell), the E° cell must be positive. This means that copper (Cu) is reduced, while zinc (Zn) is oxidized. Recall that for all cells, oxidation always occurs at the anode, while reduction always occurs at the cathode. Option E. This is a spontaneous reaction Incorrect. Since this cell does not require an external power source (i.e., is a galvanic cell), the E° cell must be positive. This means that the electrons flow spontaneously, and the cell has a Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) < 0. Therefore, the answer is C .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving electrochemical cells , we will need to determine which of the statements is false. The standard cell potential (E° cell ) is the sum of the reduction potential and oxidation potential in their standard states, measured in volts (V). E° cell = E° reduction + E° oxidation In this case, recall that oxidation always occurs at the anode, while reduction always occurs at the cathode for both galvanic (voltaic) and electrolytic cells. We can remember this using the mnemonic a RED CAT and AN OX ( red uction = cat hode, an ode = ox idation). In this case, each statement is correct except for “A cell with Cu 2+ (E° reduction = +0.34 V) at the cathode and Ag + (E° reduction = +0.80 V) at the anode is spontaneous.” STEP 1: First, we need to determine which element is reduced, and which element is oxidized: STEP 2: Next, since we are given the reduction potential of silver, we can calculate its oxidation potential. Since our E° reduction = +0.80 V, we can calculate the E° oxidation : E° oxidation = -E° reduction E° oxidation = - (+0.80 V) E° oxidation = -0.80 V STEP 3: Then, we can use the formula to determine E° cell E° cell = E° reduction + E° oxidation E° cell = +0.34 V – 0.80 V E° cell = -0.46 V STEP 4: Finally, we need to determine whether this cell is a galvanic (voltaic) cell or an electrolytic cell. Since E° cell < 0, this is an electrolytic cell. Electrolytic cells are nonspontaneous and require an external power source. Keep in mind we need to find the incorrect statement regarding electrochemical reactions. Option A. K + (E° reduction = -2.93 V) is a weaker oxidizing agent than Mn 2+ (E° reduction = -1.18 V) Incorrect. K + is a stronger reducing agent (and therefore, weaker oxidizing agent) than Mn 2+ . A reducing agent is stronger when it has a more negative reduction potential, and the E° reduction of K + (-2.93 V) is more negative than the E° reduction of Mn 2+ (-1.18 V). Another way to think of this is to realize that oxidizing agents themselves are reduced. Since K + has a lower reduction potential, it is less likely to be reduced than Mn 2+ , which implies that it is also a weaker oxidizing agent. Option B. A cell with Al 3+ (E° reduction = -1.66 V) at the cathode and I 2 (E° reduction = +0.54 V) at the anode requires an external power source. Incorrect. Oxidation always occurs at the anode, while reduction always occurs at the cathode. In this case, the E° cell = -0.54 V – 1.66 V = -2.2 V (recall that E° oxidation = -E° reduction , so the E° oxidation of I 2 is -0.54 V). Since the E° cell < 0, this is an electrolytic cell. Electrolytic cells are nonspontaneous, and therefore require an external power source. Option C. A cell with Cu 2+ (E° reduction = +0.34 V) at the cathode and Ag + (E° reduction = +0.80 V) at the anode is spontaneous. Correct. Oxidation always occurs at the anode, while reduction always occurs at the cathode. In this case, the E° cell = -0.80 + 0.34 V = -0.46 V (recall that E° oxidation = -E° reduction , so the E° oxidation of Ag + is -0.80 V). Since the E° cell < 0, this is an electrolytic cell, which are nonspontaneous . Option D. Cu 2+ (E° reduction = +0.34 V) is a stronger oxidizing agent than Al 3+ (E° reduction = -1.66 V) Incorrect. Cu 2+ is a weaker reducing agent (and therefore, stronger oxidizing agent) than Al 3+ . An oxidizing agent is stronger when it has a more positive reduction potential, and the E° reduction of Cu 2+ (+0.34 V) is more positive than the E° reduction of Al 3+ (-1.66 V). Option E. A cell with Ni 2+ (E° reduction = -0.25 V) at the cathode and Mn 2+ (E° reduction = -1.18 V) at the anode has a ΔG < 0. Incorrect. Oxidation always occurs at the anode, while reduction always occurs at the cathode. In this case, the E° cell = -0.25 V + 1.18 V = +0.93 V (recall that E° oxidation = -E° reduction , so the E° oxidation of Mn +2 is +1.18 V). Since the E° cell > 0, this is a galvanic (voltaic) cell. Galvanic cells are spontaneous, and therefore have a ΔG < 0. Therefore, the answer is C .",

Since we are not explicitly provided this value in the question, we need to calculate it. Since the E° cell = -0.51 V and the E° reduction of zinc is -0.76 V, E° cell = E° reduction + E° oxidation -0.51 V = -0.76 V + E° oxidation E° oxidation = -0.51 V + 0.76 V E° oxidation = +0.25 V STEP 3: Next, we need to determine which element in our cell is oxidized and which element is reduced.
