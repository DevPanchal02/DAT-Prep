STEP 1: First, we write a balanced equation for the conversion of Cr 3+ to Cr: Cr 3+ + 3 e - à Cr STEP 2: As we can see, 3 electrons are needed to convert each Cr 3+ ion to Cr atom. Therefore, to find out how many electrons are needed to convert one mole of Cr 3+ to Cr, we simply multiply this by Avogadro’s number (6.02 × 10 23 ): (3)(6.02 × 10 23 ) STEP 3: Because we are interested in converting 5 moles, we can multiply our answer by 5 to find out the number of electrons needed to convert 5 moles of Cr 3+ to Cr: (5)(3)(6.02 × 10 23 ) = (15)(6.02 × 10 23 ) Therefore, the answer is E .",

Therefore, it takes (9)(96,500) coulombs to convert 3 moles of Al 3+ to Al. Option B. 5 moles of Ag + to Ag Incorrect. To convert Ag + + e - à Ag, we need 1 electron.

We also know that Faraday’s constant F = 96,500. Finally, we can use the equation to relate the standard cell potential to Gibb’s Free energy, ΔG = -nFE ΔG = -(2)(96,500)(1.10) Therefore, the answer is B .",
