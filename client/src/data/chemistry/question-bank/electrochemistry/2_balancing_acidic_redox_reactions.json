      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving balancing acidic redox reaction s, we will follow the steps below: STEP 1: First, we write down the half-reactions: (1) Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ (2) ClO 4 - → Cl - STEP 2: Next, we balance all the atoms in the equation other than O and H. We can skip this step since Fe and Cl are already balanced in both half-reactions. STEP 3: Next, we balance the oxygen atoms by adding the same number of H 2 O molecules to the opposite side of the reaction. In (2), we have 4 O on the left side, and none on the right, so we add 4 H 2 O on the right: (1) Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ (2) ClO 4 - → Cl - + 4 H 2 O STEP 4: Next, we balance the hydrogen atoms by adding H + ions to the opposite side of the reaction. In (2), we have 8 H on the right side, and none on the left, so we add 8 H + on the left: (1) Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H + → Cl - + 4 H 2 O STEP 5: Next, we determine if the charges on both sides are the same. If not, we add e - to the more positive side to balance the charges on both sides. In (1), there is a +2 charge on the left and +3 on the right, so we add 1 e - on the right side. In (2), there is a -1 + 8 = +7 charge on the left and -1 on the right, so we add 8 e - on the left so both sides have a charge of -1: (1) Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ + e - (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H + + 8 e - → Cl - + 4 H 2 O STEP 6: Next, we must ensure that the number of e - in both half reactions must be the same. If not, we multiply the whole equation by appropriate integers. In (2), there are 8 e - involved, but in (1), there is only 1 e - involved, so we multiply (1) by 8: (1) 8 Fe 2+ → 8 Fe 3+ + 8 e - (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H + + 8 e - → Cl - + 4 H 2 O STEP 7: Finally, the half reactions are added together. Electrons and common terms should be cancelled out to form the balanced equation: 8 Fe 2+ + ClO 4 - + 8 H + + 8 e - → 8 Fe 3+ + 8 e - + Cl _ + 4 H 2 O 8 Fe 2+ + ClO 4 - + 8 H + → 8 Fe 3+ + Cl _ + 4 H 2 O As we can see, 8 iron atoms can be found on each side after balancing our redox reaction in acidic conditions.

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving balancing acidic redox reaction s, we will follow the steps below: STEP 1: First, we write down the half-reactions: (1) Cr(OH) 3 → CrO 4 2- (2) ClO 4 - → Cl - STEP 2: Next, we balance all the atoms in the equation other than O and H. We can skip this step since both Cr and Cl are already balanced in both half-reactions. STEP 3: Next, we balance the oxygen atoms by adding the same number of H 2 O molecules to the opposite side of the reaction. In (1), we have 3 O on the left side, and 4 O on the right side, so we add 1 H 2 O on the left side. In (2), we have 4 O on the left side, and none on the right, so we add 4 H 2 O on the right: (1) Cr(OH) 3 + H 2 O → CrO 4 2- (2) ClO 4 - → Cl - + 4 H 2 O STEP 4: Next, we balance the hydrogen atoms by adding H + ions to the opposite side of the reaction. In (1), we have 5 H on the left, and none on the right, so we add 5 H + on the right. In (2), we have 8 H on the right, and none on the left, so we add 8 H + on the left: (1) Cr(OH) 3 + H 2 O → CrO 4 2- + 5 H + (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H + → Cl - + 4 H 2 O STEP 5: Next, we determine if the charges on both sides are the same. If not, we add e - to the more positive side to balance the charges on both sides. In (1), there is a -2 + 5 = +3 charge on the right, and none on the left, so we add 3 e - on the right so both sides have a charge of 0: In (2), there is a -1 + 8 = +7 charge on the left, and -1 on the right, so we add 8 e - on the left so both sides have a charge of -1: (1) Cr(OH) 3 + H 2 O → CrO 4 2- + 5 H + + 3 e - (2) ClO 4 - + 8 H + + 8 e - → Cl - + 4 H 2 O STEP 6: Next, we must ensure that the number of e - in both half reactions must be the same. If not, we multiply the whole equation by appropriate integers. In (1), there are 3 e - involved, and in (2), there are 8 e - involved. To make the e - balanced, we multiply (1) by 8 and (2) by 3 so both sides have 24 e - involved: (1) 8 Cr(OH) 3 + 8 H 2 O → 8 CrO 4 2- + 40 H + + 24 e - (2) 3 ClO 4 - + 24 H + + 24 e - → 3 Cl - + 12 H 2 O As we can see, 24 electrons are transferred in our redox reaction in acidic conditions. At this point, we can select Option E. For demonstration purposes, we will finish balancing the redox reaction in acidic conditions. STEP 7: Finally, the half reactions are added together. Electrons and common terms should be cancelled out to form the balanced equation: 8 Cr(OH) 3 + 8 H 2 O + 3 ClO 4 - + 24 H + + 24 e - → 8 CrO 4 2- + 40 H + + 24 e - + 3 Cl - + 12 H 2 O 8 Cr(OH) 3 + 3 ClO 4 - → 8 CrO 4 2- + 16 H + + 3 Cl - + 4 H 2 O Therefore, the answer is E .",
