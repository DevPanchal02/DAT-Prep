A polar bond occurs due to the difference in electronegativity between the atoms. When one atom is significantly more electronegative, it will pull the bonding electrons more towards it, which causes the molecule to have a dipole moment where one end is slightly positive and the other end is negative. Note : Electronegativity increases as we move from left to right and from bottom to top of the periodic table, with F being the most electronegative. Given this trend, we can determine the most polar bond by inferring the largest electronegativity difference. When we do this, we determine that the O-H bond has the biggest electronegativity difference since Oxygen is much more electronegative than Hydrogen. Therefore, this results in a dipole moment, and thus a polar bond. CC By 4.0",

O-F - This bond is non-polar because the electronegativity of O is close to that of F, so there will not be a significant imbalance in electron distribution. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option C. C-C - This bond is non-polar because it is a bond between the two same atoms, which means there is no difference in electronegativity. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option D.

The rate of radioactive decay is an intrinsic property of each radioactive isotope that is independent of temperature and the chemical and physical form of the radioactive isotope. Radioactive decay is a first-order reaction because the time required for half of the nuclei in any sample of a radioactive isotope to decay is a constant, called the half-life of the isotope. Remember, the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration in first order kinetics, as shown in the image below. In radioactive decay the number of radioactive atoms decaying per unit time is proportional to the total number of radioactive atoms present at that time. Therefore, the answer is Option B .

      "concept_text": "Electron Affinity is defined as the amount of energy released or spent when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule in the gaseous state to form a negative ion. Electron affinity increases UPWARD for the groups and from LEFT to RIGHT across periods of the periodic table. The electron affinity trend is because as electrons are added to energy levels, they become closer to the nucleus resulting in a stronger attraction between the nucleus and its electrons. Remember that greater the distance, the less of an attraction; and therefore less energy is released when an electron is added to the outside orbital. In addition, the more valence electrons an element has, the more likely it is to gain electrons to form a stable octet. The less valence electrons an atom has, the least likely it will gain electrons. Exception: Group VIII of the periodic table (Noble gases) is quite special because they already have eight valence electrons, which fill their outer energy level. They can't accept any more electrons, therefore, the electron affinity of nobles gases is practically zero. Option E. Neon has the lowest affinity because its outermost shell is completely filled with electrons. CC By 4.0 *The trends are increasing in the direction the arrows are pointing towards.",

This provides useful information about the reaction’s spontaneity, such as whether the reaction will proceed or not without added energy: Going back to the question, when a reaction has a small and negative △G value, it means that the reactant has slightly more free energy than the product as shown in the image below.

      "concept_text": "In a titration experiment, a measured amount of an acid or a base solution of a known concentration is slowly added to another solution containing a base or an acid of an unknown concentration. During this experiment, the acid or base being titrated is fully neutralized at the equivalence point. At half-equivalence point , the moles of the base added are only half the moles of acid originally present. Therefore, the concentration of the conjugate base and the remaining weak acid are the same. To further explain this, recall the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pK a + log [Conjugate Base]/[Acid] pH = pK a + log [A - ]/[HA] In order for pH to equal pK a , the concentrations of the conjugate base and acid would have to be the same, as shown below: pH = pK a + log [1]/[1] pH = pK Refer to the image below for a visualization of this concept: CC By 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Equivalence point - At the equivalence point, moles of base = moles of acid. However, the pH will not equal the pKa. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option C. Triple point - The triple point describes the temperature and pressure at which solid, liquid, and gas phases of a substance coexist in equilibrium. In this case, it is not relevant to pH and titration. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option D. Second equivalence point - This usually occurs with diprotic acids or bases (can donate or accept more than one proton). E.g. at the second equivalence point, 1 mole of diprotic acid will have reacted with 2 moles of base. pH will not equal pKa at this point. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option E. Critical point - The critical point describes the endpoint of a phase equilibrium curve. At this point, the two phases become indistinguishable. E.g. liquid-gas critical point. In this case, it is not relevant to pH and titration. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "Osmotic pressure is the pressure that must be applied to a prevent osmosis of a solution. It is a colligative property , meaning it depends on the concentration of solute, and not identity of the solute. The diffusion of a solvent during osmosis produces an osmotic pressure against the membrane, which is calculated for an ideal solution by the osmosis equation: π = iMRT Where, π = osmotic pressure, i = van ‘t Hoff factor, M = solute molar concentration (mol/L), R = ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K), and T = solution temperature (in Kelvin) When MgSO 4 is dissolved in water, it dissociates into two ions, making the van 't Hoff factor equal to 2. A solution that has 0.40 M MgSO 4 gives a solution with an osmotic pressure expressed generally by: π = iMRT π = 2(0.40 mol • L -1 )(R)(T) = 0.80RT atm The other solutions involve compounds for which the product of the van 't Hoff factor and the molar solute concentration produce a higher osmotic pressure; therefore, the correct answer is that Option B. 0.40 M MgSO 4 exhibits the lowest osmotic pressure.

Since calculators are NOT allowed for the Canadian DAT, it is best not to fully solve equations and keep certain variables abbreviated as shown above.",

      "concept_text": "Avogadro’s law provides the relationship between volume and amount of gas in moles when pressure and temperature are held constant, as shown in the image below. If the amount of gas in a container is increased, the volume increases. If the amount of gas in a container is decreased, the volume decreases. This is assuming of course that the container has expandable walls. Since the relationship is directly proportional. the equation for calculations is: CC By 4.0 Therefore, the answer is Option E. Avogadro’s law since two gases of equal volumes will also have equal number of moles (number of molecules) based on this law. We can confirm this because if V 1 is equal to V 2 , then n 1 must also equal n 2 for the left side of the equation to equal the right side.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Boyle’s Law - This is incorrect because Boyle’s law states that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure when temperature is held constant and is represented by the equation P 1 V 1 = P 2 V 2 . The graph below shows the relationship between pressure and volume. CC By 4.0 Option B. Dalton’s Law - This is incorrect because Dalton’s law states that the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the individual gases’ partial pressures. The equation for Dalton’s law is P T = P 1 + P 2 + P 3 ... , as shown by the graph below. CC By 4.0 Option C. Gay-Lussac’s Law - This is incorrect because Gay-Lussac’s law states that the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to the temperature (in Kelvins) when volume is held constant. The graph below shows the relationship between pressure and temperature. CC By 4.0 Option D.

      "concept_text": "To determine the equivalent resonance structures , we must first determine the number of valence electrons. By looking at the periodic table, we can see that nitrogen belongs to Group 5, while oxygen belongs to Group 6A. Since the group number represents the number of outermost electrons, we know that nitrogen has 5 valence electrons while oxygen has 6 valence electrons. Now that we know the number of valence electrons per element, we need to compute the total number of valence electrons: 5 + (3 × 6) = 23 electrons Note : Since the whole molecule has a -1 charge, we need to keep this into consideration as well. Therefore, the total number of valence electrons is: 23 + 1 = 24 electrons Now that we have the total valence electrons, we can draw out all the possible resonance structures of NO 3 - without violating the octet rule. By doing this, we determine that there are THREE possible resonance structures can be drawn for nitrate, NO 3 - as shown below: CC BY 4.0",
