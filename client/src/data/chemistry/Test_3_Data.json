The volume of the molecules themselves at this point cannot be considered as insignificant compared to the volume of the container which they occupy. In addition, the proximity of gas molecules increase and intermolecular attractive and repulsive forces become significant, Therefore, the ideal assumptions 3 and 4 no longer hold, and the gas will behave non-ideally. Similarly, at LOW temperatures, gas molecules will start moving at slower speeds and therefore allow for attractive forces to come into play. This again contradicts the ideal assumptions and the gas will have a non-ideal behavior. This is why gases are said to exhibit ideal behavior only at HIGH temperatures and LOW pressures.",

Keep in mind that in an atom, the atomic number is equal to the number protons. Additionally, in a neutral atom, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons. If an atom is an ion, we would have to add or subtract accordingly based on its charge. For example, we can look at K + and S 2- while referring to the periodic table in the image below: For K + , the atomic number is 19 and thus number of protons it has is 19. However, it has a +1 charge , which means it has 1 less electron than protons. Therefore, we have to subtract 1 to the number of protons, as shown below: # electrons in K + = # protons – 1 # electrons in K + = 19 – 1 = 18 For S 2- , the atomic number is 16 and thus number of protons it has is 16. However, it has a -2 charge , which means it has 2 more electrons than protons. Therefore, we have to add 2 to the number of protons, as shown below: # electrons in S 2- = # protons + 2 # electrons in S 2- = 16 + 2 = 18 Based on this, only the atoms listed in Option B.

      "concept_text": "This question is a bit tricky, so let's solve this question step-by-step. STEP 1: Since there is no heat lost to the surrounding, the heat loss by the warm water is equal to the heat gain by the cold water. Therefore: H loss by warm water = H gained by cold water M 1 (T 1 – T f )C p1 = M 2 (T f – T 2 )C p2 Where, M 1 = mass of hot water (90°C), M 2 = mass of cold water (10°C) C p1 = heat capacity of hot water (90°C), C p2 = heat capacity of cold water (10°C) T 1 = initial temperature of the hot water (90°C), T 2 = initial temperature of the cold water (10°C) T f = final temperature of the mixture of the hot and cold water combined Since C p1 = C p2 , they are eliminated from the equation. Thus, the equation becomes: M 1 (T 1 – T f ) = M 2 (T f – T 2 ) STEP 2: So now that we have this equation, we need to solve for T f . To do this, we need to make sure we have all the given values: T 1 = 90 ° C, T 2 = 10 ° C M 1 = ? M 2 = ? To solve for M 1 and M 2 , we need to use the density of water: 1.0 g • /mL -1 . Hence: M 1 = (density of water) × (volume) = (1.0 g • mL -1 ) × (100 mL) = 100 g M 2 = (density of water) × (volume) = (1.0 g • mL -1 ) × (200 mL) = 200 g Therefore, the equation becomes: 100(90 – T f ) = 200(T f – 10) STEP 3: Now, we can solve the equation: Therefore, the final temperature is 36.67 which is about ~35 ° C.

Canadian DAT Pro Tip : When a strong acid reacts with a weak base, the reaction goes forward until the limiting reagent is used up. Thus, in certain conditions, if we have half the effective concentration of strong acid relative to weak base, then we can make a 1:1 preparation. The buffer is effective when the pK a is ±1.

The empirical formula describes only the ratios of each unique atom in a compound, whereas the molecular formula describes the actual number of each type of atom. The structural formula describes how the atoms are bonded to one another. STEP 1 : The first step to calculate the empirical formula is to determine the number of moles of each type of atom in a compound sample using their individual masses. Dividing each individual mass given in the question by the atomic mass of the atom yields the number of moles: Carbon : 36 g/ (12 g • mol -1 ) = 3 mol Hydrogen : 3 g/ (1 g • mol -1 ) = 3 mol Nitrogen : 21 g/ (14 g • mol -1 ) = 1.5 mol Oxygen : 24 g/ (16 g • mol -1 ) = 1.5 mol STEP 2 : Next, by dividing each molar amount by the smallest molar amount (1.5 mol) yields the relative ratios of each type of atom: C:H:N:O = 2:2:1:1. Therefore, the empirical formula of the compound is: C 2 H 2 NO STEP 3 : Lastly, from the question we know that the compound has a molecular weight of 112 g • mol -1 . A compound with a molecular formula of C 2 H 2 NO would only have a molecular weight of 56 g • mol -1 . Therefore, doubling the number of each atom yields the correct molecular formula that is consistent with the compound: C 4 H 4 N 2 O 2",

Not all proposed single-replacement reactions will occur between two given reactants. Whether or not the reaction occurs depends on the reactivity of the reactants, and this is most commonly seen in halogens (ie. Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine). Halogens that are higher up on the periodic table are more reactive. This means that the reactivity in order from highest to lowest is: fluorine > chlorine > bromine > iodine Based on this reactivity order, fluorine is more reactive than bromine, so the following reaction from Option D will not occur : CaF 2( s ) + Br 2( ℓ ) → CaBr 2( s ) + F 2( g ) Therefore, the answer is D .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving accuracy vs. precision , let’s first define the two properties: CC By 4.0 Accuracy describes the overall closeness of experimental values to the true literature value. If a set of data is accurate, that means the experimental values are grouped around the true value. Precision describes the overall consistency of experimental values. If a set of data is precise, that means the experimental values are grouped closely to each other, but not necessarily around the true value. Accuracy and precision are independent of one another. In this case, we can say that in accuracy, the average value of measurements clusters around the expected value . So Option B is correct . Therefore, the answer is B .",

The stronger these bonds are and the greater the forces of attraction between the molecules, the more energy it will require to break them and the higher the boiling point will be. An important feature of water is that its molecules can form hydrogen bonds with each other, as shown in the image below. These are intermolecular dipole-dipole forces that occur between an H-atom of one molecule and an electronegative O, N, or F atom of another molecule. Hydrogen bonds are one of the strongest intermolecular forces and breaking these interactions requires a large amount of energy, which gives water its high boiling point relative to its small size.

Van der waals forces - Even though van der waals forces between water molecules are indeed being broken as we raise the water's temperature, these forces are relatively weak and are not what causes the high boiling point observed for water.

These are not the forces that are being broken when transitioning from liquid to gas. It is the intermolecular forces, the ones between molecules, that are into play. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option C. London dispersion forces - These are the weakest intermolecular forces, and thus do not require a lot of energy to break. They do not account for the high boiling point of water. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option D.

This causes the bond length in HI to be longer than the bond length in HCl as shown in the image below; therefore, it is more likely for H + to dissociate from HI.

The type of solute itself does not affect colligative properties. All of the option choices ( Boiling point, Freezing point, Osmotic pressure, and Vapor pressure ) are colligative properties. Therefore, Option C. Heating point is the only non-colligative property listed, and thus it is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Boiling point elevation - Boiling point elevation is a colligative property. Adding solutes typically raises the boiling point regardless of the type of solute used. If you add sugar or salt to water, both solutions will have a higher boiling point than just water, with the solution with more dissolved particles having the highest boiling point. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option B. Freezing point depression - Freezing point depression is a colligative property. Adding solutes typically depresses the freezing point depending on the number of dissolved particles regardless of the type of solute. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option D. Osmotic pressure - Osmotic pressure is proportional to the concentration of solute particle, hence it is a colligative property. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option E. Vapor pressure depression - vapor pressure depression is also dependent on the concentration of solute. Adding solute usually lowers the vapor pressure of the solution. It is a colligative property.

In contrast, a reducing agent is a substance that loses an electron to an electron recipient in a redox chemical reaction — in other words it loses electrons and is oxidized in a chemical reaction. Going back to the question, we must begin by assigning oxidation numbers. Remember, hydrogen is +1 when bound to a non-metal, oxygen is usually -2 (unless in a peroxide), an element in elemental form (i.e. Cd) is 0, and any remaining oxidation numbers must be such that the total sum of the numbers equal the charge on the molecule: Cd + NiO 2 + 2 H 2 O Cd(OH) 2 + Ni(OH) 2 0    +4 -2     +1  -2         +2 -2 +1      +2 -2 +1 In the above schematic, we can see that the oxidation numbers for Cadmium and Nickel undergo a change. Between Cd and Cd(OH) 2 , the oxidation number on Cd increases from 0 to +2 which represents a loss of electrons (oxidation). Between NiO 2 and Ni(OH) 2 , the oxidation number is reduced from +4 to +2 which represents a gain of electrons (reduction). Since NiO 2 contains the atom that was reduced in the reaction, NiO 2 is the oxidizing agent.",

      "concept_text": "STEP 1: To determine the number of hydrogen atoms in 3 moles of CH 4 , we must first understand that one mole of a substance contains 6.02 × 10 23 units (can be rounded to 6 × 10 23 ), which is known as Avogadro’s number. Therefore, regardless of the molar mass of the element or the compound, one mole of the compound must contain 6.02 × 10 23 molecules. Returning back to this question, one molecule of CH 4 contains one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. The between CH 4 and H is 1:4 since there are 4 hydrogen atoms for every molecule of CH 4 . Therefore, 3 moles of CH 4 will contain 3 × 4 = 12 moles of H. STEP 2: Based on this, the number of molecules in 12 moles of H can now be calculated: # of hydrogen atoms = 12 moles × 6 x 10 23 # of hydrogen atoms = 72 moles × 10 23 atoms # of hydrogen atoms = 7.2 moles × 10 24 atoms Therefore, there are 7.2 moles × 10 24 hydrogen atoms in 3 moles of CH 4 . We can also solve this using an alternative method involving ratios, called dimensional analysis. The ratios should be arranged such that the unit present in the numerator of the first ratio is cancelled with the unit present in the denominator of the next ratio. Conversions continue until all units are cancelled out and only the desired unit remains. Therefore, the answer is E .",

      "poe_text": "Option A. The energy needed to hold electrons and protons together - The protons and electrons are not technically held together. In the simple atomic model, protons occupy the nucleus while electrons occupy the orbitals around the nucleus. The positive charge of the nucleus due to the protons (neutrons do not have a charge and therefore do not contribute to the charge of the nucleus) interacts with the negative charge of the electrons, and this is helps stabilize and keep the atom together. This is electrostatic force, NOT nuclear binding energy. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option C. The energy needed to remove an electron from an atom - This is known as ionization energy, NOT nuclear binding energy. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option D. The energy needed to raise the temperature of a compound - This is known as specific heat capacity, NOT nuclear binding energy. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option E. The energy released due to nuclear fusion - Nuclear fusion is when two atomic nuclei fuse together to form a new nucleus. This process can either release or absorb energy depending on the new nucleus that is formed. However, neither energy released nor absorbed is called nuclear binding energy.
