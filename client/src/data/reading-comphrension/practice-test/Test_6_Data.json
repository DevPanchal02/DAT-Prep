      "text": "(1). The human genome is composed of hereditary material known as DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid. The chemical structure of DNA was established in 1953, making the discovery of DNA a relatively recent development in the scientific community. It was not long after the mapping of the human genome in 2003 that genome editing became of great interest to scientists around the world. Genome editing aims to modify an organism’s DNA; with the use of advanced technologies, genetic material can be added or removed at specific locations in the genome to alter the organism’s DNA sequence. Various approaches to genetic modification have been explored: for instance, homologous recombination has been commonly used in mouse embryonic stem cells to produce germline knockout or knock-in mice, and zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) have also been used to cleave specific sites in an organism’s genome. Recently, developments in genome-editing technology have led to the discovery of bacterial adaptive immune systems, known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR).\n\n(2). The CRISPR approach is based on a naturally occurring immune response in bacteria. When viruses attack bacteria, the bacterial immune system secures portions of the viral DNA and stores them as DNA segments called CRISPR arrays; these viral DNA segments can help the bacteria identify and fight off new viral infections. If a viral infection occurs, bacteria use the CRISPR arrays to develop RNA segments that match parts of the viral genetic code – these RNA segments are called guide RNAs (gRNA). gRNAs bind to the viral DNA and guide Cas9 enzymes, or other nuclease enzymes, to cleave the DNA. The cleaving of viral DNA segments causes the virus to be inactivated and allows the bacteria to attack the virus. In recent years, researchers have discovered that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be modified to cut not just viral DNA but essentially any DNA sequence in a test tube, as well as in the nucleus of a living cell.\n\n(3). Due to rapidly growing populations, severe weather, and diminished agricultural land, scientists have turned towards genome editing techniques to establish food security. One such example is the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, the discovery of which has opened possibilities for altering genetic sequences in both plant and animal systems. The CRISPR-Cas9 system allows researchers to modify the genome of crops to increase crop production, quality, and crop diversity. In recent years, Joyce Van Eck and Zach Lippman, collaborators at the Boyce Thompson Institute in Ithaca, New York, have applied the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to try and control the size of the ground cherry plant (unlike its relative, the tomato, the ground cherry is prone to produce small fruits that fall to the ground before ripening). Van Eck and Lippman used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to modify the ground cherry’s genome so that it may reproduce some of the tomato’s genetic traits. Due to the characterization of many genome sequences, it is now possible to perform gene editing on crops such as cotton, soybeans, tomatoes, potatoes, and even grapes. Although the use of CRISPR-Cas9 has become increasingly popular in the agricultural industry, very few crop species have been thoroughly researched. Most gene editing is currently being tested on model species such as the Arabidopsis, rice, and tobacco plants. Scientists aim to continue research into altering crop genomes in the future.\n\n(4). Researchers are also exploring the application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in human gene therapy, gene therapy being an experimental technique that introduces or replaces genetic material to treat genetic disorders. Many disorders are caused by single-gene mutations and can, in theory, be treated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. In 2014, scientists implemented CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing to treat the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Although there are alternate antiviral treatments available for patients with HBV, these treatments are not entirely successful in removing the virus. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was able to significantly reduce the production of hepatitis B virus surface proteins, indicating its ability to eliminate the virus. The use of genome editing technology is also being considered for the treatment of other viruses, such as HIV and herpes.\n\n(5). Beyond genome editing, CRISPR-Cas9 has shown promising results in controlling gene expression. Scientists remodelled the technology by creating a catalytically inactive Cas-9 enzyme known as dCas9. In this remodel, the dCas9 enzyme continues to identify and bind to target DNA just as a regular Cas-9 enzyme does. However, instead of cleaving the DNA at the target site, dCas9 remains bound to the DNA sequence, disturbing the RNA polymerase and any transcription factors that intend to bind to the sequence. This system, referred to as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can therefore inhibit the expression of various genes without changing the genome itself.\n\n(6). Although the CRISPR-Cas9 system is regarded as one of the most versatile methods in genome editing technology, there are some challenges researchers are facing with the system. One major disadvantage of the CRISPR-Cas9 method is off-target mutations. In a large genome, it is likely that the DNA will contain several sequences that are homologous to the target sequence, and the challenge with the CRISPR-Cas9 system is that it may result in the cleaving of those homologous sequences, causing unwanted mutations and cell death. To avoid such an outcome, researchers are selecting target sequences that have a minimal number of off-target sites. As such, in 2014, scientists developed a searching tool known as CasOT, which locates possible off-target sites throughout the genome, and this has helped to reduce the number of off-target mutations.\n\n(7). Another challenge researchers have come across with the CRISPR-Cas9 model is its PAM dependence. With the presence of gRNA, CRISPR-Cas9 can theoretically be used for any DNA sequence but for CRISPR-Cas9 to maintain specificity, there must be a 2- 5 nucleotide PAM sequence present downstream from the target sequence itself. This PAM dependence limits the number of sites that may be considered target sequences within the CRISPR-Cas9 model, though it does benefit the gene-editing technology as it promotes increased specificity of CRISPR-Cas9. As a result, the model that requires a longer PAM sequence will have a reduced occurrence of off-target mutations.\n\n(8). Scientists are attempting to improve the CRISPR-Cas9 model to move forward in the field of gene editing, but given the nature of the field, there are many ethical concerns that need to be taken into consideration. For instance, the implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 in agriculture raises the same issues that were brought forth during the rise of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Many individuals feel troubled by the idea of consuming genetically modified and processed foods, though scientists argue that while GMOs were dominated by corporations, the CRISPR-Cas9 technology will be used for academic purposes. Unlike the GMO industry, scientists claim that CRISPR-Cas9 will be transparent and accessible, giving academic researchers and non-profit institutions the opportunity to study the technology as well.\n\n(9). Another ethical concern that may be raised is the use of genome editing technology on humans. While there are several cases of human trials, some researchers in China have gone so far as to implement CRISPR-Cas9 on embryos to select for protection against HIV. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health worry that germline genome editing is not well-researched and, as a result, may pose a safety concern for testing on embryos; others have moral or religious objections against human embryo testing, and, as a result, federal funds are currently not being used for any gene-editing research on embryos. However, many countries are continuing to fund CRISPR research on viable and non-viable embryos to try and gain a better understanding of how germline editing affects future generations. In general, bioethicists and researchers currently agree that studies testing human genome editing for reproductive purposes should be avoided.\n\n(10). Although there remains a lot of research to be done, the CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing technology is a promising tool that has the potential to increase crop diversity, control gene expression, and even treat genetic disorders. Due to its increased specificity and versatility, CRISPR-Cas9 is quickly becoming a popular system among researchers. It is hoped that advances in technology may lead to a future where scientists can successfully treat genetic diseases and eliminate life-threatening viruses altogether."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should search the passage for a preliminary mention of the term “Cas9.” It can be presumed that a description of Cas9 will follow the initial appearance of the term in the passage. Cas9 is first mentioned in paragraph 2: “If a viral infection occurs, bacteria use the CRISPR arrays to develop RNA segments that match parts of the viral genetic code – these RNA segments are called guide RNAs (gRNA). gRNAs bind to the viral DNA and guide Cas9 enzymes , or other nuclease enzymes, to cleave the DNA.” This tells us that a Cas9 enzyme is a nuclease enzyme. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. A CRISPR array – is incorrect because a CRISPR array is a DNA segment, not an enzyme. Option C. A viral protein – is incorrect because the Cas9 enzyme is a part of the bacterial immune system and thus cannot be classified as a viral protein. Option D. A DNA sequence – is incorrect because the Cas9 enzyme is not a DNA sequence.",

      "text": "(1). The human genome is composed of hereditary material known as DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid. The chemical structure of DNA was established in 1953, making the discovery of DNA a relatively recent development in the scientific community. It was not long after the mapping of the human genome in 2003 that genome editing became of great interest to scientists around the world. Genome editing aims to modify an organism’s DNA; with the use of advanced technologies, genetic material can be added or removed at specific locations in the genome to alter the organism’s DNA sequence. Various approaches to genetic modification have been explored: for instance, homologous recombination has been commonly used in mouse embryonic stem cells to produce germline knockout or knock-in mice, and zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) have also been used to cleave specific sites in an organism’s genome. Recently, developments in genome-editing technology have led to the discovery of bacterial adaptive immune systems, known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR).\n\n(2). The CRISPR approach is based on a naturally occurring immune response in bacteria. When viruses attack bacteria, the bacterial immune system secures portions of the viral DNA and stores them as DNA segments called CRISPR arrays; these viral DNA segments can help the bacteria identify and fight off new viral infections. If a viral infection occurs, bacteria use the CRISPR arrays to develop RNA segments that match parts of the viral genetic code – these RNA segments are called guide RNAs (gRNA). gRNAs bind to the viral DNA and guide Cas9 enzymes, or other nuclease enzymes, to cleave the DNA. The cleaving of viral DNA segments causes the virus to be inactivated and allows the bacteria to attack the virus. In recent years, researchers have discovered that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be modified to cut not just viral DNA but essentially any DNA sequence in a test tube, as well as in the nucleus of a living cell.\n\n(3). Due to rapidly growing populations, severe weather, and diminished agricultural land, scientists have turned towards genome editing techniques to establish food security. One such example is the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, the discovery of which has opened possibilities for altering genetic sequences in both plant and animal systems. The CRISPR-Cas9 system allows researchers to modify the genome of crops to increase crop production, quality, and crop diversity. In recent years, Joyce Van Eck and Zach Lippman, collaborators at the Boyce Thompson Institute in Ithaca, New York, have applied the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to try and control the size of the ground cherry plant (unlike its relative, the tomato, the ground cherry is prone to produce small fruits that fall to the ground before ripening). Van Eck and Lippman used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to modify the ground cherry’s genome so that it may reproduce some of the tomato’s genetic traits. Due to the characterization of many genome sequences, it is now possible to perform gene editing on crops such as cotton, soybeans, tomatoes, potatoes, and even grapes. Although the use of CRISPR-Cas9 has become increasingly popular in the agricultural industry, very few crop species have been thoroughly researched. Most gene editing is currently being tested on model species such as the Arabidopsis, rice, and tobacco plants. Scientists aim to continue research into altering crop genomes in the future.\n\n(4). Researchers are also exploring the application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in human gene therapy, gene therapy being an experimental technique that introduces or replaces genetic material to treat genetic disorders. Many disorders are caused by single-gene mutations and can, in theory, be treated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. In 2014, scientists implemented CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing to treat the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Although there are alternate antiviral treatments available for patients with HBV, these treatments are not entirely successful in removing the virus. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was able to significantly reduce the production of hepatitis B virus surface proteins, indicating its ability to eliminate the virus. The use of genome editing technology is also being considered for the treatment of other viruses, such as HIV and herpes.\n\n(5). Beyond genome editing, CRISPR-Cas9 has shown promising results in controlling gene expression. Scientists remodelled the technology by creating a catalytically inactive Cas-9 enzyme known as dCas9. In this remodel, the dCas9 enzyme continues to identify and bind to target DNA just as a regular Cas-9 enzyme does. However, instead of cleaving the DNA at the target site, dCas9 remains bound to the DNA sequence, disturbing the RNA polymerase and any transcription factors that intend to bind to the sequence. This system, referred to as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can therefore inhibit the expression of various genes without changing the genome itself.\n\n(6). Although the CRISPR-Cas9 system is regarded as one of the most versatile methods in genome editing technology, there are some challenges researchers are facing with the system. One major disadvantage of the CRISPR-Cas9 method is off-target mutations. In a large genome, it is likely that the DNA will contain several sequences that are homologous to the target sequence, and the challenge with the CRISPR-Cas9 system is that it may result in the cleaving of those homologous sequences, causing unwanted mutations and cell death. To avoid such an outcome, researchers are selecting target sequences that have a minimal number of off-target sites. As such, in 2014, scientists developed a searching tool known as CasOT, which locates possible off-target sites throughout the genome, and this has helped to reduce the number of off-target mutations.\n\n(7). Another challenge researchers have come across with the CRISPR-Cas9 model is its PAM dependence. With the presence of gRNA, CRISPR-Cas9 can theoretically be used for any DNA sequence but for CRISPR-Cas9 to maintain specificity, there must be a 2- 5 nucleotide PAM sequence present downstream from the target sequence itself. This PAM dependence limits the number of sites that may be considered target sequences within the CRISPR-Cas9 model, though it does benefit the gene-editing technology as it promotes increased specificity of CRISPR-Cas9. As a result, the model that requires a longer PAM sequence will have a reduced occurrence of off-target mutations.\n\n(8). Scientists are attempting to improve the CRISPR-Cas9 model to move forward in the field of gene editing, but given the nature of the field, there are many ethical concerns that need to be taken into consideration. For instance, the implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 in agriculture raises the same issues that were brought forth during the rise of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Many individuals feel troubled by the idea of consuming genetically modified and processed foods, though scientists argue that while GMOs were dominated by corporations, the CRISPR-Cas9 technology will be used for academic purposes. Unlike the GMO industry, scientists claim that CRISPR-Cas9 will be transparent and accessible, giving academic researchers and non-profit institutions the opportunity to study the technology as well.\n\n(9). Another ethical concern that may be raised is the use of genome editing technology on humans. While there are several cases of human trials, some researchers in China have gone so far as to implement CRISPR-Cas9 on embryos to select for protection against HIV. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health worry that germline genome editing is not well-researched and, as a result, may pose a safety concern for testing on embryos; others have moral or religious objections against human embryo testing, and, as a result, federal funds are currently not being used for any gene-editing research on embryos. However, many countries are continuing to fund CRISPR research on viable and non-viable embryos to try and gain a better understanding of how germline editing affects future generations. In general, bioethicists and researchers currently agree that studies testing human genome editing for reproductive purposes should be avoided.\n\n(10). Although there remains a lot of research to be done, the CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing technology is a promising tool that has the potential to increase crop diversity, control gene expression, and even treat genetic disorders. Due to its increased specificity and versatility, CRISPR-Cas9 is quickly becoming a popular system among researchers. It is hoped that advances in technology may lead to a future where scientists can successfully treat genetic diseases and eliminate life-threatening viruses altogether."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should first read paragraph 8 carefully before attempting to ascertain the main points made in this section of the text; by combining these main points, we can then deduce the message that the author is trying to convey. Paragraph 8 reads: “Scientists are attempting to improve the CRISPR-Cas9 model to move forward in the field of gene editing, but given the nature of the field, there are many ethical concerns that need to be taken into consideration. For instance, the implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 in agriculture raises the same issues that were brought forth during the rise of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Many individuals feel troubled by the idea of consuming genetically modified and processed foods, though scientists argue that while GMOs were dominated by corporations, the CRISPR-Cas9 technology will be used for academic purposes. Unlike the GMO industry, scientists claim that CRISPR-Cas9 will be transparent and accessible, giving academic researchers and non-profit institutions the opportunity to study the technology as well.” The main points of this paragraph are as follows: If we combine these points, we can say that the author is attempting to convey the fact that, although people are concerned about the CRISPR-Cas9 model, scientists argue that it will be more transparent and less worrisome than GMOs. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. CRISPR-Cas9 technology and GMOs are equally harmful – is incorrect because this is not implied in the passage. The author states, “while GMOs were dominated by corporations, the CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used for academic purposes,” which does not imply that one technology is as harmful as the other. Option C. CRISPR-Cas9 is set to become the leading technique in genetic modification – is incorrect because this is not implied in the passage. The author states, “Unlike the GMO industry, scientists claim that CRISPR-Cas9 will be transparent and accessible,” which doesn’t imply that CRISPR–Cas9 will necessarily become the leading genetic modification technique, only that it would be more transparent than GMOs. Option D. CRISPR-Cas9 is more morally questionable than GMOs – is incorrect because in paragraph 8, the author argues that GMOs are dominated by corporations while CRISPR-Cas9 is used for academics and that it is transparent and accessible. This doesn’t imply that CRISPR-Cas9 is more morally questionable but that GMOs are more concerning.",

      "text": "(1). The human genome is composed of hereditary material known as DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid. The chemical structure of DNA was established in 1953, making the discovery of DNA a relatively recent development in the scientific community. It was not long after the mapping of the human genome in 2003 that genome editing became of great interest to scientists around the world. Genome editing aims to modify an organism’s DNA; with the use of advanced technologies, genetic material can be added or removed at specific locations in the genome to alter the organism’s DNA sequence. Various approaches to genetic modification have been explored: for instance, homologous recombination has been commonly used in mouse embryonic stem cells to produce germline knockout or knock-in mice, and zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) have also been used to cleave specific sites in an organism’s genome. Recently, developments in genome-editing technology have led to the discovery of bacterial adaptive immune systems, known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR).\n\n(2). The CRISPR approach is based on a naturally occurring immune response in bacteria. When viruses attack bacteria, the bacterial immune system secures portions of the viral DNA and stores them as DNA segments called CRISPR arrays; these viral DNA segments can help the bacteria identify and fight off new viral infections. If a viral infection occurs, bacteria use the CRISPR arrays to develop RNA segments that match parts of the viral genetic code – these RNA segments are called guide RNAs (gRNA). gRNAs bind to the viral DNA and guide Cas9 enzymes, or other nuclease enzymes, to cleave the DNA. The cleaving of viral DNA segments causes the virus to be inactivated and allows the bacteria to attack the virus. In recent years, researchers have discovered that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be modified to cut not just viral DNA but essentially any DNA sequence in a test tube, as well as in the nucleus of a living cell.\n\n(3). Due to rapidly growing populations, severe weather, and diminished agricultural land, scientists have turned towards genome editing techniques to establish food security. One such example is the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, the discovery of which has opened possibilities for altering genetic sequences in both plant and animal systems. The CRISPR-Cas9 system allows researchers to modify the genome of crops to increase crop production, quality, and crop diversity. In recent years, Joyce Van Eck and Zach Lippman, collaborators at the Boyce Thompson Institute in Ithaca, New York, have applied the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to try and control the size of the ground cherry plant (unlike its relative, the tomato, the ground cherry is prone to produce small fruits that fall to the ground before ripening). Van Eck and Lippman used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to modify the ground cherry’s genome so that it may reproduce some of the tomato’s genetic traits. Due to the characterization of many genome sequences, it is now possible to perform gene editing on crops such as cotton, soybeans, tomatoes, potatoes, and even grapes. Although the use of CRISPR-Cas9 has become increasingly popular in the agricultural industry, very few crop species have been thoroughly researched. Most gene editing is currently being tested on model species such as the Arabidopsis, rice, and tobacco plants. Scientists aim to continue research into altering crop genomes in the future.\n\n(4). Researchers are also exploring the application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in human gene therapy, gene therapy being an experimental technique that introduces or replaces genetic material to treat genetic disorders. Many disorders are caused by single-gene mutations and can, in theory, be treated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. In 2014, scientists implemented CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing to treat the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Although there are alternate antiviral treatments available for patients with HBV, these treatments are not entirely successful in removing the virus. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was able to significantly reduce the production of hepatitis B virus surface proteins, indicating its ability to eliminate the virus. The use of genome editing technology is also being considered for the treatment of other viruses, such as HIV and herpes.\n\n(5). Beyond genome editing, CRISPR-Cas9 has shown promising results in controlling gene expression. Scientists remodelled the technology by creating a catalytically inactive Cas-9 enzyme known as dCas9. In this remodel, the dCas9 enzyme continues to identify and bind to target DNA just as a regular Cas-9 enzyme does. However, instead of cleaving the DNA at the target site, dCas9 remains bound to the DNA sequence, disturbing the RNA polymerase and any transcription factors that intend to bind to the sequence. This system, referred to as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can therefore inhibit the expression of various genes without changing the genome itself.\n\n(6). Although the CRISPR-Cas9 system is regarded as one of the most versatile methods in genome editing technology, there are some challenges researchers are facing with the system. One major disadvantage of the CRISPR-Cas9 method is off-target mutations. In a large genome, it is likely that the DNA will contain several sequences that are homologous to the target sequence, and the challenge with the CRISPR-Cas9 system is that it may result in the cleaving of those homologous sequences, causing unwanted mutations and cell death. To avoid such an outcome, researchers are selecting target sequences that have a minimal number of off-target sites. As such, in 2014, scientists developed a searching tool known as CasOT, which locates possible off-target sites throughout the genome, and this has helped to reduce the number of off-target mutations.\n\n(7). Another challenge researchers have come across with the CRISPR-Cas9 model is its PAM dependence. With the presence of gRNA, CRISPR-Cas9 can theoretically be used for any DNA sequence but for CRISPR-Cas9 to maintain specificity, there must be a 2- 5 nucleotide PAM sequence present downstream from the target sequence itself. This PAM dependence limits the number of sites that may be considered target sequences within the CRISPR-Cas9 model, though it does benefit the gene-editing technology as it promotes increased specificity of CRISPR-Cas9. As a result, the model that requires a longer PAM sequence will have a reduced occurrence of off-target mutations.\n\n(8). Scientists are attempting to improve the CRISPR-Cas9 model to move forward in the field of gene editing, but given the nature of the field, there are many ethical concerns that need to be taken into consideration. For instance, the implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 in agriculture raises the same issues that were brought forth during the rise of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Many individuals feel troubled by the idea of consuming genetically modified and processed foods, though scientists argue that while GMOs were dominated by corporations, the CRISPR-Cas9 technology will be used for academic purposes. Unlike the GMO industry, scientists claim that CRISPR-Cas9 will be transparent and accessible, giving academic researchers and non-profit institutions the opportunity to study the technology as well.\n\n(9). Another ethical concern that may be raised is the use of genome editing technology on humans. While there are several cases of human trials, some researchers in China have gone so far as to implement CRISPR-Cas9 on embryos to select for protection against HIV. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health worry that germline genome editing is not well-researched and, as a result, may pose a safety concern for testing on embryos; others have moral or religious objections against human embryo testing, and, as a result, federal funds are currently not being used for any gene-editing research on embryos. However, many countries are continuing to fund CRISPR research on viable and non-viable embryos to try and gain a better understanding of how germline editing affects future generations. In general, bioethicists and researchers currently agree that studies testing human genome editing for reproductive purposes should be avoided.\n\n(10). Although there remains a lot of research to be done, the CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing technology is a promising tool that has the potential to increase crop diversity, control gene expression, and even treat genetic disorders. Due to its increased specificity and versatility, CRISPR-Cas9 is quickly becoming a popular system among researchers. It is hoped that advances in technology may lead to a future where scientists can successfully treat genetic diseases and eliminate life-threatening viruses altogether."

With the presence of gRNA, CRISPR-Cas9 can theoretically be used for any DNA sequence but for CRISPR-Cas9 to maintain specificity, there must be a 2- 5 nucleotide PAM sequence present downstream from the target sequence itself. This PAM dependence limits the number of sites that may be considered target sequences within the CRISPR-Cas9 model, though it does benefit the gene-editing technology as it promotes increased specificity of CRISPR-Cas9. As a result, the model that requires a longer PAM sequence will have a reduced occurrence of off-target mutations.\n\n(8). Scientists are attempting to improve the CRISPR-Cas9 model to move forward in the field of gene editing, but given the nature of the field, there are many ethical concerns that need to be taken into consideration. For instance, the implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 in agriculture raises the same issues that were brought forth during the rise of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Many individuals feel troubled by the idea of consuming genetically modified and processed foods, though scientists argue that while GMOs were dominated by corporations, the CRISPR-Cas9 technology will be used for academic purposes. Unlike the GMO industry, scientists claim that CRISPR-Cas9 will be transparent and accessible, giving academic researchers and non-profit institutions the opportunity to study the technology as well.\n\n(9). Another ethical concern that may be raised is the use of genome editing technology on humans. While there are several cases of human trials, some researchers in China have gone so far as to implement CRISPR-Cas9 on embryos to select for protection against HIV. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health worry that germline genome editing is not well-researched and, as a result, may pose a safety concern for testing on embryos; others have moral or religious objections against human embryo testing, and, as a result, federal funds are currently not being used for any gene-editing research on embryos. However, many countries are continuing to fund CRISPR research on viable and non-viable embryos to try and gain a better understanding of how germline editing affects future generations. In general, bioethicists and researchers currently agree that studies testing human genome editing for reproductive purposes should be avoided.\n\n(10). Although there remains a lot of research to be done, the CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing technology is a promising tool that has the potential to increase crop diversity, control gene expression, and even treat genetic disorders. Due to its increased specificity and versatility, CRISPR-Cas9 is quickly becoming a popular system among researchers. It is hoped that advances in technology may lead to a future where scientists can successfully treat genetic diseases and eliminate life-threatening viruses altogether."

      "text": "(1). The human genome is composed of hereditary material known as DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid. The chemical structure of DNA was established in 1953, making the discovery of DNA a relatively recent development in the scientific community. It was not long after the mapping of the human genome in 2003 that genome editing became of great interest to scientists around the world. Genome editing aims to modify an organism’s DNA; with the use of advanced technologies, genetic material can be added or removed at specific locations in the genome to alter the organism’s DNA sequence. Various approaches to genetic modification have been explored: for instance, homologous recombination has been commonly used in mouse embryonic stem cells to produce germline knockout or knock-in mice, and zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) have also been used to cleave specific sites in an organism’s genome. Recently, developments in genome-editing technology have led to the discovery of bacterial adaptive immune systems, known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR).\n\n(2). The CRISPR approach is based on a naturally occurring immune response in bacteria. When viruses attack bacteria, the bacterial immune system secures portions of the viral DNA and stores them as DNA segments called CRISPR arrays; these viral DNA segments can help the bacteria identify and fight off new viral infections. If a viral infection occurs, bacteria use the CRISPR arrays to develop RNA segments that match parts of the viral genetic code – these RNA segments are called guide RNAs (gRNA). gRNAs bind to the viral DNA and guide Cas9 enzymes, or other nuclease enzymes, to cleave the DNA. The cleaving of viral DNA segments causes the virus to be inactivated and allows the bacteria to attack the virus. In recent years, researchers have discovered that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be modified to cut not just viral DNA but essentially any DNA sequence in a test tube, as well as in the nucleus of a living cell.\n\n(3). Due to rapidly growing populations, severe weather, and diminished agricultural land, scientists have turned towards genome editing techniques to establish food security. One such example is the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, the discovery of which has opened possibilities for altering genetic sequences in both plant and animal systems. The CRISPR-Cas9 system allows researchers to modify the genome of crops to increase crop production, quality, and crop diversity. In recent years, Joyce Van Eck and Zach Lippman, collaborators at the Boyce Thompson Institute in Ithaca, New York, have applied the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to try and control the size of the ground cherry plant (unlike its relative, the tomato, the ground cherry is prone to produce small fruits that fall to the ground before ripening). Van Eck and Lippman used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to modify the ground cherry’s genome so that it may reproduce some of the tomato’s genetic traits. Due to the characterization of many genome sequences, it is now possible to perform gene editing on crops such as cotton, soybeans, tomatoes, potatoes, and even grapes. Although the use of CRISPR-Cas9 has become increasingly popular in the agricultural industry, very few crop species have been thoroughly researched. Most gene editing is currently being tested on model species such as the Arabidopsis, rice, and tobacco plants. Scientists aim to continue research into altering crop genomes in the future.\n\n(4). Researchers are also exploring the application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in human gene therapy, gene therapy being an experimental technique that introduces or replaces genetic material to treat genetic disorders. Many disorders are caused by single-gene mutations and can, in theory, be treated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. In 2014, scientists implemented CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing to treat the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Although there are alternate antiviral treatments available for patients with HBV, these treatments are not entirely successful in removing the virus. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was able to significantly reduce the production of hepatitis B virus surface proteins, indicating its ability to eliminate the virus. The use of genome editing technology is also being considered for the treatment of other viruses, such as HIV and herpes.\n\n(5). Beyond genome editing, CRISPR-Cas9 has shown promising results in controlling gene expression. Scientists remodelled the technology by creating a catalytically inactive Cas-9 enzyme known as dCas9. In this remodel, the dCas9 enzyme continues to identify and bind to target DNA just as a regular Cas-9 enzyme does. However, instead of cleaving the DNA at the target site, dCas9 remains bound to the DNA sequence, disturbing the RNA polymerase and any transcription factors that intend to bind to the sequence. This system, referred to as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can therefore inhibit the expression of various genes without changing the genome itself.\n\n(6). Although the CRISPR-Cas9 system is regarded as one of the most versatile methods in genome editing technology, there are some challenges researchers are facing with the system. One major disadvantage of the CRISPR-Cas9 method is off-target mutations. In a large genome, it is likely that the DNA will contain several sequences that are homologous to the target sequence, and the challenge with the CRISPR-Cas9 system is that it may result in the cleaving of those homologous sequences, causing unwanted mutations and cell death. To avoid such an outcome, researchers are selecting target sequences that have a minimal number of off-target sites. As such, in 2014, scientists developed a searching tool known as CasOT, which locates possible off-target sites throughout the genome, and this has helped to reduce the number of off-target mutations.\n\n(7). Another challenge researchers have come across with the CRISPR-Cas9 model is its PAM dependence.

Beyond genome editing, CRISPR-Cas9 has shown promising results in controlling gene expression. Scientists remodelled the technology by creating a catalytically inactive Cas-9 enzyme known as dCas9. In this remodel, the dCas9 enzyme continues to identify and bind to target DNA just as a regular Cas-9 enzyme does. However, instead of cleaving the DNA at the target site, dCas9 remains bound to the DNA sequence, disturbing the RNA polymerase and any transcription factors that intend to bind to the sequence. This system, referred to as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can therefore inhibit the expression of various genes without changing the genome itself.\n\n(6). Although the CRISPR-Cas9 system is regarded as one of the most versatile methods in genome editing technology, there are some challenges researchers are facing with the system. One major disadvantage of the CRISPR-Cas9 method is off-target mutations. In a large genome, it is likely that the DNA will contain several sequences that are homologous to the target sequence, and the challenge with the CRISPR-Cas9 system is that it may result in the cleaving of those homologous sequences, causing unwanted mutations and cell death. To avoid such an outcome, researchers are selecting target sequences that have a minimal number of off-target sites. As such, in 2014, scientists developed a searching tool known as CasOT, which locates possible off-target sites throughout the genome, and this has helped to reduce the number of off-target mutations.\n\n(7). Another challenge researchers have come across with the CRISPR-Cas9 model is its PAM dependence. With the presence of gRNA, CRISPR-Cas9 can theoretically be used for any DNA sequence but for CRISPR-Cas9 to maintain specificity, there must be a 2- 5 nucleotide PAM sequence present downstream from the target sequence itself. This PAM dependence limits the number of sites that may be considered target sequences within the CRISPR-Cas9 model, though it does benefit the gene-editing technology as it promotes increased specificity of CRISPR-Cas9. As a result, the model that requires a longer PAM sequence will have a reduced occurrence of off-target mutations.\n\n(8). Scientists are attempting to improve the CRISPR-Cas9 model to move forward in the field of gene editing, but given the nature of the field, there are many ethical concerns that need to be taken into consideration. For instance, the implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 in agriculture raises the same issues that were brought forth during the rise of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Many individuals feel troubled by the idea of consuming genetically modified and processed foods, though scientists argue that while GMOs were dominated by corporations, the CRISPR-Cas9 technology will be used for academic purposes. Unlike the GMO industry, scientists claim that CRISPR-Cas9 will be transparent and accessible, giving academic researchers and non-profit institutions the opportunity to study the technology as well.\n\n(9). Another ethical concern that may be raised is the use of genome editing technology on humans. While there are several cases of human trials, some researchers in China have gone so far as to implement CRISPR-Cas9 on embryos to select for protection against HIV. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health worry that germline genome editing is not well-researched and, as a result, may pose a safety concern for testing on embryos; others have moral or religious objections against human embryo testing, and, as a result, federal funds are currently not being used for any gene-editing research on embryos. However, many countries are continuing to fund CRISPR research on viable and non-viable embryos to try and gain a better understanding of how germline editing affects future generations. In general, bioethicists and researchers currently agree that studies testing human genome editing for reproductive purposes should be avoided.\n\n(10). Although there remains a lot of research to be done, the CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing technology is a promising tool that has the potential to increase crop diversity, control gene expression, and even treat genetic disorders. Due to its increased specificity and versatility, CRISPR-Cas9 is quickly becoming a popular system among researchers. It is hoped that advances in technology may lead to a future where scientists can successfully treat genetic diseases and eliminate life-threatening viruses altogether."

      "text": "(1). The human genome is composed of hereditary material known as DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid. The chemical structure of DNA was established in 1953, making the discovery of DNA a relatively recent development in the scientific community. It was not long after the mapping of the human genome in 2003 that genome editing became of great interest to scientists around the world. Genome editing aims to modify an organism’s DNA; with the use of advanced technologies, genetic material can be added or removed at specific locations in the genome to alter the organism’s DNA sequence. Various approaches to genetic modification have been explored: for instance, homologous recombination has been commonly used in mouse embryonic stem cells to produce germline knockout or knock-in mice, and zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) have also been used to cleave specific sites in an organism’s genome. Recently, developments in genome-editing technology have led to the discovery of bacterial adaptive immune systems, known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR).\n\n(2). The CRISPR approach is based on a naturally occurring immune response in bacteria. When viruses attack bacteria, the bacterial immune system secures portions of the viral DNA and stores them as DNA segments called CRISPR arrays; these viral DNA segments can help the bacteria identify and fight off new viral infections. If a viral infection occurs, bacteria use the CRISPR arrays to develop RNA segments that match parts of the viral genetic code – these RNA segments are called guide RNAs (gRNA). gRNAs bind to the viral DNA and guide Cas9 enzymes, or other nuclease enzymes, to cleave the DNA. The cleaving of viral DNA segments causes the virus to be inactivated and allows the bacteria to attack the virus. In recent years, researchers have discovered that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be modified to cut not just viral DNA but essentially any DNA sequence in a test tube, as well as in the nucleus of a living cell.\n\n(3). Due to rapidly growing populations, severe weather, and diminished agricultural land, scientists have turned towards genome editing techniques to establish food security. One such example is the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, the discovery of which has opened possibilities for altering genetic sequences in both plant and animal systems. The CRISPR-Cas9 system allows researchers to modify the genome of crops to increase crop production, quality, and crop diversity. In recent years, Joyce Van Eck and Zach Lippman, collaborators at the Boyce Thompson Institute in Ithaca, New York, have applied the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to try and control the size of the ground cherry plant (unlike its relative, the tomato, the ground cherry is prone to produce small fruits that fall to the ground before ripening). Van Eck and Lippman used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to modify the ground cherry’s genome so that it may reproduce some of the tomato’s genetic traits. Due to the characterization of many genome sequences, it is now possible to perform gene editing on crops such as cotton, soybeans, tomatoes, potatoes, and even grapes. Although the use of CRISPR-Cas9 has become increasingly popular in the agricultural industry, very few crop species have been thoroughly researched. Most gene editing is currently being tested on model species such as the Arabidopsis, rice, and tobacco plants. Scientists aim to continue research into altering crop genomes in the future.\n\n(4). Researchers are also exploring the application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in human gene therapy, gene therapy being an experimental technique that introduces or replaces genetic material to treat genetic disorders. Many disorders are caused by single-gene mutations and can, in theory, be treated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. In 2014, scientists implemented CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing to treat the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Although there are alternate antiviral treatments available for patients with HBV, these treatments are not entirely successful in removing the virus. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was able to significantly reduce the production of hepatitis B virus surface proteins, indicating its ability to eliminate the virus. The use of genome editing technology is also being considered for the treatment of other viruses, such as HIV and herpes.\n\n(5).

When viruses attack bacteria, the bacterial immune system secures portions of the viral DNA and stores them as DNA segments called CRISPR arrays; these viral DNA segments can help the bacteria identify and fight off new viral infections. If a viral infection occurs, bacteria use the CRISPR arrays to develop RNA segments that match parts of the viral genetic code – these RNA segments are called guide RNAs (gRNA). gRNAs bind to the viral DNA and guide Cas9 enzymes, or other nuclease enzymes, to cleave the DNA. The cleaving of viral DNA segments causes the virus to be inactivated and allows the bacteria to attack the virus. In recent years, researchers have discovered that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be modified to cut not just viral DNA but essentially any DNA sequence in a test tube, as well as in the nucleus of a living cell.\n\n(3). Due to rapidly growing populations, severe weather, and diminished agricultural land, scientists have turned towards genome editing techniques to establish food security. One such example is the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, the discovery of which has opened possibilities for altering genetic sequences in both plant and animal systems. The CRISPR-Cas9 system allows researchers to modify the genome of crops to increase crop production, quality, and crop diversity. In recent years, Joyce Van Eck and Zach Lippman, collaborators at the Boyce Thompson Institute in Ithaca, New York, have applied the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to try and control the size of the ground cherry plant (unlike its relative, the tomato, the ground cherry is prone to produce small fruits that fall to the ground before ripening). Van Eck and Lippman used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to modify the ground cherry’s genome so that it may reproduce some of the tomato’s genetic traits. Due to the characterization of many genome sequences, it is now possible to perform gene editing on crops such as cotton, soybeans, tomatoes, potatoes, and even grapes. Although the use of CRISPR-Cas9 has become increasingly popular in the agricultural industry, very few crop species have been thoroughly researched. Most gene editing is currently being tested on model species such as the Arabidopsis, rice, and tobacco plants. Scientists aim to continue research into altering crop genomes in the future.\n\n(4). Researchers are also exploring the application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in human gene therapy, gene therapy being an experimental technique that introduces or replaces genetic material to treat genetic disorders. Many disorders are caused by single-gene mutations and can, in theory, be treated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. In 2014, scientists implemented CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing to treat the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Although there are alternate antiviral treatments available for patients with HBV, these treatments are not entirely successful in removing the virus. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was able to significantly reduce the production of hepatitis B virus surface proteins, indicating its ability to eliminate the virus. The use of genome editing technology is also being considered for the treatment of other viruses, such as HIV and herpes.\n\n(5). Beyond genome editing, CRISPR-Cas9 has shown promising results in controlling gene expression. Scientists remodelled the technology by creating a catalytically inactive Cas-9 enzyme known as dCas9. In this remodel, the dCas9 enzyme continues to identify and bind to target DNA just as a regular Cas-9 enzyme does. However, instead of cleaving the DNA at the target site, dCas9 remains bound to the DNA sequence, disturbing the RNA polymerase and any transcription factors that intend to bind to the sequence. This system, referred to as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can therefore inhibit the expression of various genes without changing the genome itself.\n\n(6). Although the CRISPR-Cas9 system is regarded as one of the most versatile methods in genome editing technology, there are some challenges researchers are facing with the system. One major disadvantage of the CRISPR-Cas9 method is off-target mutations. In a large genome, it is likely that the DNA will contain several sequences that are homologous to the target sequence, and the challenge with the CRISPR-Cas9 system is that it may result in the cleaving of those homologous sequences, causing unwanted mutations and cell death. To avoid such an outcome, researchers are selecting target sequences that have a minimal number of off-target sites. As such, in 2014, scientists developed a searching tool known as CasOT, which locates possible off-target sites throughout the genome, and this has helped to reduce the number of off-target mutations.\n\n(7). Another challenge researchers have come across with the CRISPR-Cas9 model is its PAM dependence. With the presence of gRNA, CRISPR-Cas9 can theoretically be used for any DNA sequence but for CRISPR-Cas9 to maintain specificity, there must be a 2- 5 nucleotide PAM sequence present downstream from the target sequence itself. This PAM dependence limits the number of sites that may be considered target sequences within the CRISPR-Cas9 model, though it does benefit the gene-editing technology as it promotes increased specificity of CRISPR-Cas9. As a result, the model that requires a longer PAM sequence will have a reduced occurrence of off-target mutations.\n\n(8). Scientists are attempting to improve the CRISPR-Cas9 model to move forward in the field of gene editing, but given the nature of the field, there are many ethical concerns that need to be taken into consideration. For instance, the implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 in agriculture raises the same issues that were brought forth during the rise of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Many individuals feel troubled by the idea of consuming genetically modified and processed foods, though scientists argue that while GMOs were dominated by corporations, the CRISPR-Cas9 technology will be used for academic purposes. Unlike the GMO industry, scientists claim that CRISPR-Cas9 will be transparent and accessible, giving academic researchers and non-profit institutions the opportunity to study the technology as well.\n\n(9). Another ethical concern that may be raised is the use of genome editing technology on humans. While there are several cases of human trials, some researchers in China have gone so far as to implement CRISPR-Cas9 on embryos to select for protection against HIV. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health worry that germline genome editing is not well-researched and, as a result, may pose a safety concern for testing on embryos; others have moral or religious objections against human embryo testing, and, as a result, federal funds are currently not being used for any gene-editing research on embryos. However, many countries are continuing to fund CRISPR research on viable and non-viable embryos to try and gain a better understanding of how germline editing affects future generations. In general, bioethicists and researchers currently agree that studies testing human genome editing for reproductive purposes should be avoided.\n\n(10). Although there remains a lot of research to be done, the CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing technology is a promising tool that has the potential to increase crop diversity, control gene expression, and even treat genetic disorders. Due to its increased specificity and versatility, CRISPR-Cas9 is quickly becoming a popular system among researchers. It is hoped that advances in technology may lead to a future where scientists can successfully treat genetic diseases and eliminate life-threatening viruses altogether."

It was not long after the mapping of the human genome in 2003 that genome editing became of great interest to scientists around the world.

CasOT is only brought up in paragraph 6: “…in 2014, scientists developed a searching tool known as CasOT, which locates possible off-target sites throughout the genome, and this has helped to reduce the number of off-target mutations.” This tells us that the purpose of CasOT is to locate potential off-target sites in the genome. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",

It cleaves parts of target DNA sequences – is incorrect because in paragraph 6, the author says that CasOT “locates possible off-target sites throughout the genome,” not cleaves parts of the target DNA sequences. This is done by the Cas9 enzyme. Option B. It remains bound to the DNA sequence – is incorrect because in paragraph 6, the author says that CasOT “locates possible off-target sites throughout the genome,” not that it remains bound to the DNA sequence. This better describes dCas9. Option D. It locates potential PAM sequences – is incorrect because in paragraph 6, the author says that CasOT “locates possible off-target sites throughout the genome,” not that it locates potential PAM sequences.",

      "text": "(1). The plastic pollution crisis has escalated to the point where it has now become a global issue. It is estimated that by 2030, the amount of plastic pollution on the planet will double; if this epidemic continues, by 2050, there will be far more plastic than fish in the sea. But how did this crisis begin?\n\n(2). Plastic is synthesized by assembling long-chain molecules from single repetitive units known as monomers; with the addition of heat, pressure, and catalysts, chemical reactions are performed to link such monomers together. Typically, the monomers used in plastic synthesis are derived from fossil fuels (crude oil and natural gas). Polyethylene terephthalate (or PET) is a commonly used polymer that is found in the manufacturing of bottles and clothing, while Bakelite, or polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, was the first synthetic plastic produced in 1907.\n\n(3). Global plastic production started to take off rapidly in the 1950s. While production was estimated to have been only 2 million tonnes annually in 1950, by 2015, plastic production was recorded to be 381 million tonnes per year, an increase of approximately 200-fold. By now, the world has already produced 78 billion tonnes of plastic.\n\n(4). After the end of the Second World War, materials developed for use during combat such as polyethylene (a product originally used to insulate radar cables), were adapted for post-war applications, and became widely used as consumer plastics. Prior to the mid-20th century, consumer goods were made from traditional materials like wood, glass, and metal. However, techniques such as injection molding allowed plastic to be produced more efficiently than these materials and in greater quantities, lowering their overall cost and making them more accessible to the growing middle class of the post-war era. The economic boom that followed the war further led to the growth of consumer culture and plastics rapidly became the material of choice for a wide range of goods, from kitchen utensils to children’s toys. Thus, plastics transformed everyday life, becoming integral to society as we know it today.\n\n(5). The appetite for plastic seems to stem from its irresistibly attractive qualities, such as its lightweight nature, flexibility, versatility, strength, water-resistant capacity, and most of all, its relatively cheap cost; however, people’s insatiable desire for the material has resulted in the over-consumption of plastic goods. Although its durability and slow-to-degrade nature allowed plastics to be utilized in mass production, the large-scale use of plastic has come at a high cost. Over time, plastic has lingered as waste, waste that has slowly suffocated wildlife, adversely impacted human health, and polluted the environment.\n\n(6). Improperly discarded plastic can impact our wildlife via three crucial routes, the first being “entanglement,” which is the entrapping, encircling, or constricting of marine animals by plastic debris. In most cases, wildlife becomes entangled in plastic ropes and netting and/or discarded fishing gear, while entanglement due to plastic packaging has also been documented.\n\n(7). The second route is via the “ingestion” of plastic, which can occur intentionally due to an animal mistaking plastic for food, or unintentionally and indirectly, for instance, via the ingestion of prey species that contain plastic. Additionally, tiny pieces of plastic such as plastic fibers may accidentally be taken up by filter-feeding oysters or mussels. As we travel upwards on the food chain, ingesting such toxic material becomes increasingly deadly due to bioaccumulation and thus, would pose a huge risk to iconic creatures such as sharks and other predators at the top of our ocean’s food chains. In larger fish, scientists have recorded the presence of cigarette packets, food packaging, and plastic films; in some extreme cases, a rope, hose, flowerpots, and plastic sheeting have been found in sperm whales. Consumption of large volumes of plastic can have varied biological effects, such as decreased stomach capacity, poor appetite, and a misleading sense of satiation. The specific impact of reduced food intake in certain organisms has been carefully investigated and documented by researchers. For instance, it results in a slower metabolic rate and survival in Asian green mussels, reduced reproducibility in copepods, reduced growth and development of langoustine, and decreased energy stores in shore crabs. Other effects include obstruction or perforation of the gut, gastric rupture, ulcerative lesions, and even death. Some of the biochemical responses to plastic ingestion are metabolic disruption, decreased enzyme activity, cellular necrosis, and oxidative stress.\n\n(8). The third crucial route by which plastic debris affects wildlife is through “interaction.” This includes contact with plastic waste through collisions, obstructions, and abrasions. One simple example is fishing gear, which can cause damage to coral reef ecosystems and other marine wildlife upon collision. Plastic debris can also interfere with substrate availability and disrupt light penetration and oxygen exchange.\n\n(9). Research on the exposure and impact of microplastics (plastic particles >4.75 mm in diameter) on human health is ongoing. The smaller the particle size (micro-and nano-range), the greater the concern for human health. Possible routes of exposure to these minuscule particles include consumption through water and marine products, exposure to the skin via cosmetics, or inhalation of particles in the air. Research suggests that, for humans, the danger due to uptake of microplastics through diet is limited; microplastics appear to concentrate within the gut and the digestive tracts of fish, parts not typically consumed by humans. However, plastic fibers have also been detected in honey, beer, and table salt. To date, research only indicates negligible health risks from such exposure, though the mechanisms of microplastic interaction within the body are yet to be discovered, if at all. A study of North Sea fish suggested that plastic does not persist for a long duration within the organism; thus, one hypothesis is that plastic particles may directly exit through the GI tract without any negative impact, which would indeed bring about a wave of relief. However, such results may be met with skepticism and can perhaps only begin to be accepted once such studies are replicated, and findings are deemed reliable. It is hoped that future studies will better characterize the potential risks of microplastics and their impact on human health.\n\n(10). Although the long-term effects of microplastics on human health have not been proven, the consumption of these particles could potentially lead to a host of troubling issues. For instance, microplastics may irritate the lining of the digestive tract and, if able to enter vital organs such as the brain or liver, could disrupt the body’s normal functions. In the long term, the ingestion of microplastics may cause developmental, reproductive, and metabolic disorders. If microplastics were to carry with them dangerous microorganisms from the environment, this could also cause infections within the body. Microplastics may impact the human immune system, resulting in chronic inflammation or immune-related diseases. Additionally, it has been suggested that microplastics can cause cancer because certain additives in plastic are known to be carcinogenic, including a compound known as “styrene.” Repeated exposure to carcinogenic materials, such as through the repeated consumption of microplastics containing these particles, could feasibly increase one’s risk of the disease.\n\n(11). Plastic waste is commonly handled in one of three ways: through recycling, incineration (the burning of any given material), or disposal in landfills. A meta-study analyzed the impact of each method across factors, such as its global warming potential (GWP) and its total energy use (TEU). Across nearly all studies examined, recycling appears to be the most suitable option. Still, a few caveats must be noted. For instance, plastics can usually only be recycled once or twice; following this, they either end up in a landfill or must be incinerated. As such, recycling seems only to delay, rather than prevent, incineration and disposal. Also, recycling may not be the most economically favorable choice because recycled material is not necessarily a one-for-one displacement of primary plastic production. In other words, each tonne of recycled material does not prevent one tonne of primary material from being produced. This is due to the nature of the recycling process, which often results in products of lower economic value termed as “downcycling.”\n\n(12). In the 1980s and prior, plastic was largely discarded, while recycling and incineration were negligible. Incineration and recycling rates began to increase from 1980 and 1990, respectively, by approximately 0.7% per year; by 2015, about half of the global plastic waste was discarded, a quarter incinerated, and another quarter recycled. Extrapolating historical trends to 2050, incineration rates are predicted to increase to 50%, recycling to 44%, and discarded waste is estimated to decline to a mere 6%.\n\n(13). Although the potential increase in the recycling trend is to our advantage, the same cannot be said for the predicted incline in incineration rates. The burning of plastic can release toxic chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, heavy metals, and other carcinogens that can have adverse effects on the human body, but the horror does not stop there. Incineration of plastic has several environmental impacts as well – these include the production of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), which contributes to climate change, the incomplete combustion of Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), and Polystyrene (PS), which can release toxic gases such as carbon monoxide (CO). Additionally, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can produce dioxins, which are persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Therefore, to avoid such detrimental effects, it is necessary to prevent the open or uncontrolled incineration of plastics.\n\n(14). High-income countries have invested in the regulation of waste management and incinerator sites by monitoring the emissions and potential leakages to the environment. Modern incinerators have been designed to combat the issue of dioxins and other toxic emissions by ensuring efficient combustion, selective catalytic reduction, end-of-pipe treatment, and the addition of appropriate inhibitors. A testament to the success of such technologies has been evidenced by a study conducted in Belgium where no increase was recorded in the dioxin-serum levels of those working in municipal incinerator facilities compared to the high exposure rates they would have experienced if such methods were not in place. However, in low-to-middle income countries where such incinerator technologies are vastly absent and environmental regulations are laxer, the open burning of municipal waste is a continual occurrence. The adoption of modern, efficient, low-risk technologies is required on the global scale to convert incineration into a universally safe solution for plastic waste management.\n\n(15). Once plastic enters our oceans via coastlines, tides, rivers, and marine waters, its accumulation and dispersion patterns are determined by oceanic surface currents and winds. The buoyant nature of plastic allows it to float on oceanic surfaces, and because of being carried by the wind, plastics tend to agglomerate in oceanic gyres, with the greatest concentration at the center of ocean basins. Basins located in the Northern Hemisphere were recorded to have the greatest concentration of plastics, a predictable outcome because most of the world’s population resides within the Northern Hemisphere. Although the quantity of plastic clustered in Southern oceans was relatively lesser than in the Northern oceans, the amount was of the same order of magnitude as the Northern; this was surprising as there is a lack of coastal populations and plastic inputs in the Southern Hemisphere. This unexpected finding suggests that plastic pollution can be transported between oceanic gyres and basins to a significantly greater degree than once hypothesized.\n\n(16). So, what is the solution? A plethora of ideas has been suggested, with many underways. But, the question remains, will all, or any, of them, be successful? As Tom Downdall, the owner of Transformative Change Consulting, very aptly stated in response to the popular focus on recyclability and recycling: “Solving the plastic pollution crisis requires focus on another ‘R’—Responsibility.” If everyone, from multi-million-dollar companies to singular individuals, were to assume the responsibility and become intentional in their efforts to combat the plastic pollution crisis, then perhaps there might still be hope."

Polyethylene terephthalate (or PET) is a commonly used polymer that is found in the manufacturing of bottles and clothing, while Bakelite, or polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, was the first synthetic plastic produced in 1907.\n\n(3). Global plastic production started to take off rapidly in the 1950s. While production was estimated to have been only 2 million tonnes annually in 1950, by 2015, plastic production was recorded to be 381 million tonnes per year, an increase of approximately 200-fold. By now, the world has already produced 78 billion tonnes of plastic.\n\n(4). After the end of the Second World War, materials developed for use during combat such as polyethylene (a product originally used to insulate radar cables), were adapted for post-war applications, and became widely used as consumer plastics. Prior to the mid-20th century, consumer goods were made from traditional materials like wood, glass, and metal. However, techniques such as injection molding allowed plastic to be produced more efficiently than these materials and in greater quantities, lowering their overall cost and making them more accessible to the growing middle class of the post-war era. The economic boom that followed the war further led to the growth of consumer culture and plastics rapidly became the material of choice for a wide range of goods, from kitchen utensils to children’s toys. Thus, plastics transformed everyday life, becoming integral to society as we know it today.\n\n(5). The appetite for plastic seems to stem from its irresistibly attractive qualities, such as its lightweight nature, flexibility, versatility, strength, water-resistant capacity, and most of all, its relatively cheap cost; however, people’s insatiable desire for the material has resulted in the over-consumption of plastic goods. Although its durability and slow-to-degrade nature allowed plastics to be utilized in mass production, the large-scale use of plastic has come at a high cost. Over time, plastic has lingered as waste, waste that has slowly suffocated wildlife, adversely impacted human health, and polluted the environment.\n\n(6). Improperly discarded plastic can impact our wildlife via three crucial routes, the first being “entanglement,” which is the entrapping, encircling, or constricting of marine animals by plastic debris. In most cases, wildlife becomes entangled in plastic ropes and netting and/or discarded fishing gear, while entanglement due to plastic packaging has also been documented.\n\n(7). The second route is via the “ingestion” of plastic, which can occur intentionally due to an animal mistaking plastic for food, or unintentionally and indirectly, for instance, via the ingestion of prey species that contain plastic. Additionally, tiny pieces of plastic such as plastic fibers may accidentally be taken up by filter-feeding oysters or mussels. As we travel upwards on the food chain, ingesting such toxic material becomes increasingly deadly due to bioaccumulation and thus, would pose a huge risk to iconic creatures such as sharks and other predators at the top of our ocean’s food chains. In larger fish, scientists have recorded the presence of cigarette packets, food packaging, and plastic films; in some extreme cases, a rope, hose, flowerpots, and plastic sheeting have been found in sperm whales. Consumption of large volumes of plastic can have varied biological effects, such as decreased stomach capacity, poor appetite, and a misleading sense of satiation. The specific impact of reduced food intake in certain organisms has been carefully investigated and documented by researchers. For instance, it results in a slower metabolic rate and survival in Asian green mussels, reduced reproducibility in copepods, reduced growth and development of langoustine, and decreased energy stores in shore crabs. Other effects include obstruction or perforation of the gut, gastric rupture, ulcerative lesions, and even death. Some of the biochemical responses to plastic ingestion are metabolic disruption, decreased enzyme activity, cellular necrosis, and oxidative stress.\n\n(8). The third crucial route by which plastic debris affects wildlife is through “interaction.” This includes contact with plastic waste through collisions, obstructions, and abrasions. One simple example is fishing gear, which can cause damage to coral reef ecosystems and other marine wildlife upon collision. Plastic debris can also interfere with substrate availability and disrupt light penetration and oxygen exchange.\n\n(9). Research on the exposure and impact of microplastics (plastic particles >4.75 mm in diameter) on human health is ongoing. The smaller the particle size (micro-and nano-range), the greater the concern for human health. Possible routes of exposure to these minuscule particles include consumption through water and marine products, exposure to the skin via cosmetics, or inhalation of particles in the air. Research suggests that, for humans, the danger due to uptake of microplastics through diet is limited; microplastics appear to concentrate within the gut and the digestive tracts of fish, parts not typically consumed by humans. However, plastic fibers have also been detected in honey, beer, and table salt. To date, research only indicates negligible health risks from such exposure, though the mechanisms of microplastic interaction within the body are yet to be discovered, if at all. A study of North Sea fish suggested that plastic does not persist for a long duration within the organism; thus, one hypothesis is that plastic particles may directly exit through the GI tract without any negative impact, which would indeed bring about a wave of relief. However, such results may be met with skepticism and can perhaps only begin to be accepted once such studies are replicated, and findings are deemed reliable. It is hoped that future studies will better characterize the potential risks of microplastics and their impact on human health.\n\n(10). Although the long-term effects of microplastics on human health have not been proven, the consumption of these particles could potentially lead to a host of troubling issues. For instance, microplastics may irritate the lining of the digestive tract and, if able to enter vital organs such as the brain or liver, could disrupt the body’s normal functions. In the long term, the ingestion of microplastics may cause developmental, reproductive, and metabolic disorders. If microplastics were to carry with them dangerous microorganisms from the environment, this could also cause infections within the body. Microplastics may impact the human immune system, resulting in chronic inflammation or immune-related diseases. Additionally, it has been suggested that microplastics can cause cancer because certain additives in plastic are known to be carcinogenic, including a compound known as “styrene.” Repeated exposure to carcinogenic materials, such as through the repeated consumption of microplastics containing these particles, could feasibly increase one’s risk of the disease.\n\n(11). Plastic waste is commonly handled in one of three ways: through recycling, incineration (the burning of any given material), or disposal in landfills. A meta-study analyzed the impact of each method across factors, such as its global warming potential (GWP) and its total energy use (TEU). Across nearly all studies examined, recycling appears to be the most suitable option. Still, a few caveats must be noted. For instance, plastics can usually only be recycled once or twice; following this, they either end up in a landfill or must be incinerated. As such, recycling seems only to delay, rather than prevent, incineration and disposal. Also, recycling may not be the most economically favorable choice because recycled material is not necessarily a one-for-one displacement of primary plastic production. In other words, each tonne of recycled material does not prevent one tonne of primary material from being produced. This is due to the nature of the recycling process, which often results in products of lower economic value termed as “downcycling.”\n\n(12). In the 1980s and prior, plastic was largely discarded, while recycling and incineration were negligible. Incineration and recycling rates began to increase from 1980 and 1990, respectively, by approximately 0.7% per year; by 2015, about half of the global plastic waste was discarded, a quarter incinerated, and another quarter recycled. Extrapolating historical trends to 2050, incineration rates are predicted to increase to 50%, recycling to 44%, and discarded waste is estimated to decline to a mere 6%.\n\n(13). Although the potential increase in the recycling trend is to our advantage, the same cannot be said for the predicted incline in incineration rates. The burning of plastic can release toxic chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, heavy metals, and other carcinogens that can have adverse effects on the human body, but the horror does not stop there. Incineration of plastic has several environmental impacts as well – these include the production of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), which contributes to climate change, the incomplete combustion of Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), and Polystyrene (PS), which can release toxic gases such as carbon monoxide (CO). Additionally, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can produce dioxins, which are persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Therefore, to avoid such detrimental effects, it is necessary to prevent the open or uncontrolled incineration of plastics.\n\n(14). High-income countries have invested in the regulation of waste management and incinerator sites by monitoring the emissions and potential leakages to the environment. Modern incinerators have been designed to combat the issue of dioxins and other toxic emissions by ensuring efficient combustion, selective catalytic reduction, end-of-pipe treatment, and the addition of appropriate inhibitors. A testament to the success of such technologies has been evidenced by a study conducted in Belgium where no increase was recorded in the dioxin-serum levels of those working in municipal incinerator facilities compared to the high exposure rates they would have experienced if such methods were not in place. However, in low-to-middle income countries where such incinerator technologies are vastly absent and environmental regulations are laxer, the open burning of municipal waste is a continual occurrence. The adoption of modern, efficient, low-risk technologies is required on the global scale to convert incineration into a universally safe solution for plastic waste management.\n\n(15). Once plastic enters our oceans via coastlines, tides, rivers, and marine waters, its accumulation and dispersion patterns are determined by oceanic surface currents and winds. The buoyant nature of plastic allows it to float on oceanic surfaces, and because of being carried by the wind, plastics tend to agglomerate in oceanic gyres, with the greatest concentration at the center of ocean basins. Basins located in the Northern Hemisphere were recorded to have the greatest concentration of plastics, a predictable outcome because most of the world’s population resides within the Northern Hemisphere. Although the quantity of plastic clustered in Southern oceans was relatively lesser than in the Northern oceans, the amount was of the same order of magnitude as the Northern; this was surprising as there is a lack of coastal populations and plastic inputs in the Southern Hemisphere. This unexpected finding suggests that plastic pollution can be transported between oceanic gyres and basins to a significantly greater degree than once hypothesized.\n\n(16). So, what is the solution? A plethora of ideas has been suggested, with many underways. But, the question remains, will all, or any, of them, be successful? As Tom Downdall, the owner of Transformative Change Consulting, very aptly stated in response to the popular focus on recyclability and recycling: “Solving the plastic pollution crisis requires focus on another ‘R’—Responsibility.” If everyone, from multi-million-dollar companies to singular individuals, were to assume the responsibility and become intentional in their efforts to combat the plastic pollution crisis, then perhaps there might still be hope."

The appetite for plastic seems to stem from its irresistibly attractive qualities, such as its lightweight nature, flexibility, versatility, strength, water-resistant capacity, and most of all, its relatively cheap cost; however, people’s insatiable desire for the material has resulted in the over-consumption of plastic goods. Although its durability and slow-to-degrade nature allowed plastics to be utilized in mass production, the large-scale use of plastic has come at a high cost. Over time, plastic has lingered as waste, waste that has slowly suffocated wildlife, adversely impacted human health, and polluted the environment.\n\n(6). Improperly discarded plastic can impact our wildlife via three crucial routes, the first being “entanglement,” which is the entrapping, encircling, or constricting of marine animals by plastic debris. In most cases, wildlife becomes entangled in plastic ropes and netting and/or discarded fishing gear, while entanglement due to plastic packaging has also been documented.\n\n(7). The second route is via the “ingestion” of plastic, which can occur intentionally due to an animal mistaking plastic for food, or unintentionally and indirectly, for instance, via the ingestion of prey species that contain plastic. Additionally, tiny pieces of plastic such as plastic fibers may accidentally be taken up by filter-feeding oysters or mussels. As we travel upwards on the food chain, ingesting such toxic material becomes increasingly deadly due to bioaccumulation and thus, would pose a huge risk to iconic creatures such as sharks and other predators at the top of our ocean’s food chains. In larger fish, scientists have recorded the presence of cigarette packets, food packaging, and plastic films; in some extreme cases, a rope, hose, flowerpots, and plastic sheeting have been found in sperm whales. Consumption of large volumes of plastic can have varied biological effects, such as decreased stomach capacity, poor appetite, and a misleading sense of satiation. The specific impact of reduced food intake in certain organisms has been carefully investigated and documented by researchers. For instance, it results in a slower metabolic rate and survival in Asian green mussels, reduced reproducibility in copepods, reduced growth and development of langoustine, and decreased energy stores in shore crabs. Other effects include obstruction or perforation of the gut, gastric rupture, ulcerative lesions, and even death. Some of the biochemical responses to plastic ingestion are metabolic disruption, decreased enzyme activity, cellular necrosis, and oxidative stress.\n\n(8). The third crucial route by which plastic debris affects wildlife is through “interaction.” This includes contact with plastic waste through collisions, obstructions, and abrasions. One simple example is fishing gear, which can cause damage to coral reef ecosystems and other marine wildlife upon collision. Plastic debris can also interfere with substrate availability and disrupt light penetration and oxygen exchange.\n\n(9). Research on the exposure and impact of microplastics (plastic particles >4.75 mm in diameter) on human health is ongoing. The smaller the particle size (micro-and nano-range), the greater the concern for human health. Possible routes of exposure to these minuscule particles include consumption through water and marine products, exposure to the skin via cosmetics, or inhalation of particles in the air. Research suggests that, for humans, the danger due to uptake of microplastics through diet is limited; microplastics appear to concentrate within the gut and the digestive tracts of fish, parts not typically consumed by humans. However, plastic fibers have also been detected in honey, beer, and table salt. To date, research only indicates negligible health risks from such exposure, though the mechanisms of microplastic interaction within the body are yet to be discovered, if at all. A study of North Sea fish suggested that plastic does not persist for a long duration within the organism; thus, one hypothesis is that plastic particles may directly exit through the GI tract without any negative impact, which would indeed bring about a wave of relief. However, such results may be met with skepticism and can perhaps only begin to be accepted once such studies are replicated, and findings are deemed reliable. It is hoped that future studies will better characterize the potential risks of microplastics and their impact on human health.\n\n(10). Although the long-term effects of microplastics on human health have not been proven, the consumption of these particles could potentially lead to a host of troubling issues. For instance, microplastics may irritate the lining of the digestive tract and, if able to enter vital organs such as the brain or liver, could disrupt the body’s normal functions. In the long term, the ingestion of microplastics may cause developmental, reproductive, and metabolic disorders. If microplastics were to carry with them dangerous microorganisms from the environment, this could also cause infections within the body. Microplastics may impact the human immune system, resulting in chronic inflammation or immune-related diseases. Additionally, it has been suggested that microplastics can cause cancer because certain additives in plastic are known to be carcinogenic, including a compound known as “styrene.” Repeated exposure to carcinogenic materials, such as through the repeated consumption of microplastics containing these particles, could feasibly increase one’s risk of the disease.\n\n(11). Plastic waste is commonly handled in one of three ways: through recycling, incineration (the burning of any given material), or disposal in landfills. A meta-study analyzed the impact of each method across factors, such as its global warming potential (GWP) and its total energy use (TEU). Across nearly all studies examined, recycling appears to be the most suitable option. Still, a few caveats must be noted. For instance, plastics can usually only be recycled once or twice; following this, they either end up in a landfill or must be incinerated. As such, recycling seems only to delay, rather than prevent, incineration and disposal. Also, recycling may not be the most economically favorable choice because recycled material is not necessarily a one-for-one displacement of primary plastic production. In other words, each tonne of recycled material does not prevent one tonne of primary material from being produced. This is due to the nature of the recycling process, which often results in products of lower economic value termed as “downcycling.”\n\n(12). In the 1980s and prior, plastic was largely discarded, while recycling and incineration were negligible. Incineration and recycling rates began to increase from 1980 and 1990, respectively, by approximately 0.7% per year; by 2015, about half of the global plastic waste was discarded, a quarter incinerated, and another quarter recycled. Extrapolating historical trends to 2050, incineration rates are predicted to increase to 50%, recycling to 44%, and discarded waste is estimated to decline to a mere 6%.\n\n(13). Although the potential increase in the recycling trend is to our advantage, the same cannot be said for the predicted incline in incineration rates. The burning of plastic can release toxic chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, heavy metals, and other carcinogens that can have adverse effects on the human body, but the horror does not stop there. Incineration of plastic has several environmental impacts as well – these include the production of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), which contributes to climate change, the incomplete combustion of Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), and Polystyrene (PS), which can release toxic gases such as carbon monoxide (CO). Additionally, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can produce dioxins, which are persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Therefore, to avoid such detrimental effects, it is necessary to prevent the open or uncontrolled incineration of plastics.\n\n(14). High-income countries have invested in the regulation of waste management and incinerator sites by monitoring the emissions and potential leakages to the environment. Modern incinerators have been designed to combat the issue of dioxins and other toxic emissions by ensuring efficient combustion, selective catalytic reduction, end-of-pipe treatment, and the addition of appropriate inhibitors. A testament to the success of such technologies has been evidenced by a study conducted in Belgium where no increase was recorded in the dioxin-serum levels of those working in municipal incinerator facilities compared to the high exposure rates they would have experienced if such methods were not in place. However, in low-to-middle income countries where such incinerator technologies are vastly absent and environmental regulations are laxer, the open burning of municipal waste is a continual occurrence. The adoption of modern, efficient, low-risk technologies is required on the global scale to convert incineration into a universally safe solution for plastic waste management.\n\n(15). Once plastic enters our oceans via coastlines, tides, rivers, and marine waters, its accumulation and dispersion patterns are determined by oceanic surface currents and winds. The buoyant nature of plastic allows it to float on oceanic surfaces, and because of being carried by the wind, plastics tend to agglomerate in oceanic gyres, with the greatest concentration at the center of ocean basins. Basins located in the Northern Hemisphere were recorded to have the greatest concentration of plastics, a predictable outcome because most of the world’s population resides within the Northern Hemisphere. Although the quantity of plastic clustered in Southern oceans was relatively lesser than in the Northern oceans, the amount was of the same order of magnitude as the Northern; this was surprising as there is a lack of coastal populations and plastic inputs in the Southern Hemisphere. This unexpected finding suggests that plastic pollution can be transported between oceanic gyres and basins to a significantly greater degree than once hypothesized.\n\n(16). So, what is the solution? A plethora of ideas has been suggested, with many underways. But, the question remains, will all, or any, of them, be successful? As Tom Downdall, the owner of Transformative Change Consulting, very aptly stated in response to the popular focus on recyclability and recycling: “Solving the plastic pollution crisis requires focus on another ‘R’—Responsibility.” If everyone, from multi-million-dollar companies to singular individuals, were to assume the responsibility and become intentional in their efforts to combat the plastic pollution crisis, then perhaps there might still be hope."

      "text": "(1). The plastic pollution crisis has escalated to the point where it has now become a global issue. It is estimated that by 2030, the amount of plastic pollution on the planet will double; if this epidemic continues, by 2050, there will be far more plastic than fish in the sea. But how did this crisis begin?\n\n(2). Plastic is synthesized by assembling long-chain molecules from single repetitive units known as monomers; with the addition of heat, pressure, and catalysts, chemical reactions are performed to link such monomers together. Typically, the monomers used in plastic synthesis are derived from fossil fuels (crude oil and natural gas). Polyethylene terephthalate (or PET) is a commonly used polymer that is found in the manufacturing of bottles and clothing, while Bakelite, or polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, was the first synthetic plastic produced in 1907.\n\n(3). Global plastic production started to take off rapidly in the 1950s.

By now, the world has already produced 78 billion tonnes of plastic.\n\n(4). After the end of the Second World War, materials developed for use during combat such as polyethylene (a product originally used to insulate radar cables), were adapted for post-war applications, and became widely used as consumer plastics. Prior to the mid-20th century, consumer goods were made from traditional materials like wood, glass, and metal. However, techniques such as injection molding allowed plastic to be produced more efficiently than these materials and in greater quantities, lowering their overall cost and making them more accessible to the growing middle class of the post-war era. The economic boom that followed the war further led to the growth of consumer culture and plastics rapidly became the material of choice for a wide range of goods, from kitchen utensils to children’s toys.

One simple example is fishing gear, which can cause damage to coral reef ecosystems and other marine wildlife upon collision. Plastic debris can also interfere with substrate availability and disrupt light penetration and oxygen exchange.\n\n(9). Research on the exposure and impact of microplastics (plastic particles >4.75 mm in diameter) on human health is ongoing. The smaller the particle size (micro-and nano-range), the greater the concern for human health. Possible routes of exposure to these minuscule particles include consumption through water and marine products, exposure to the skin via cosmetics, or inhalation of particles in the air. Research suggests that, for humans, the danger due to uptake of microplastics through diet is limited; microplastics appear to concentrate within the gut and the digestive tracts of fish, parts not typically consumed by humans. However, plastic fibers have also been detected in honey, beer, and table salt. To date, research only indicates negligible health risks from such exposure, though the mechanisms of microplastic interaction within the body are yet to be discovered, if at all. A study of North Sea fish suggested that plastic does not persist for a long duration within the organism; thus, one hypothesis is that plastic particles may directly exit through the GI tract without any negative impact, which would indeed bring about a wave of relief. However, such results may be met with skepticism and can perhaps only begin to be accepted once such studies are replicated, and findings are deemed reliable. It is hoped that future studies will better characterize the potential risks of microplastics and their impact on human health.\n\n(10). Although the long-term effects of microplastics on human health have not been proven, the consumption of these particles could potentially lead to a host of troubling issues. For instance, microplastics may irritate the lining of the digestive tract and, if able to enter vital organs such as the brain or liver, could disrupt the body’s normal functions. In the long term, the ingestion of microplastics may cause developmental, reproductive, and metabolic disorders. If microplastics were to carry with them dangerous microorganisms from the environment, this could also cause infections within the body. Microplastics may impact the human immune system, resulting in chronic inflammation or immune-related diseases. Additionally, it has been suggested that microplastics can cause cancer because certain additives in plastic are known to be carcinogenic, including a compound known as “styrene.” Repeated exposure to carcinogenic materials, such as through the repeated consumption of microplastics containing these particles, could feasibly increase one’s risk of the disease.\n\n(11). Plastic waste is commonly handled in one of three ways: through recycling, incineration (the burning of any given material), or disposal in landfills. A meta-study analyzed the impact of each method across factors, such as its global warming potential (GWP) and its total energy use (TEU). Across nearly all studies examined, recycling appears to be the most suitable option. Still, a few caveats must be noted. For instance, plastics can usually only be recycled once or twice; following this, they either end up in a landfill or must be incinerated. As such, recycling seems only to delay, rather than prevent, incineration and disposal. Also, recycling may not be the most economically favorable choice because recycled material is not necessarily a one-for-one displacement of primary plastic production. In other words, each tonne of recycled material does not prevent one tonne of primary material from being produced. This is due to the nature of the recycling process, which often results in products of lower economic value termed as “downcycling.”\n\n(12). In the 1980s and prior, plastic was largely discarded, while recycling and incineration were negligible. Incineration and recycling rates began to increase from 1980 and 1990, respectively, by approximately 0.7% per year; by 2015, about half of the global plastic waste was discarded, a quarter incinerated, and another quarter recycled. Extrapolating historical trends to 2050, incineration rates are predicted to increase to 50%, recycling to 44%, and discarded waste is estimated to decline to a mere 6%.\n\n(13). Although the potential increase in the recycling trend is to our advantage, the same cannot be said for the predicted incline in incineration rates. The burning of plastic can release toxic chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, heavy metals, and other carcinogens that can have adverse effects on the human body, but the horror does not stop there. Incineration of plastic has several environmental impacts as well – these include the production of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), which contributes to climate change, the incomplete combustion of Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), and Polystyrene (PS), which can release toxic gases such as carbon monoxide (CO). Additionally, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can produce dioxins, which are persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Therefore, to avoid such detrimental effects, it is necessary to prevent the open or uncontrolled incineration of plastics.\n\n(14). High-income countries have invested in the regulation of waste management and incinerator sites by monitoring the emissions and potential leakages to the environment. Modern incinerators have been designed to combat the issue of dioxins and other toxic emissions by ensuring efficient combustion, selective catalytic reduction, end-of-pipe treatment, and the addition of appropriate inhibitors. A testament to the success of such technologies has been evidenced by a study conducted in Belgium where no increase was recorded in the dioxin-serum levels of those working in municipal incinerator facilities compared to the high exposure rates they would have experienced if such methods were not in place. However, in low-to-middle income countries where such incinerator technologies are vastly absent and environmental regulations are laxer, the open burning of municipal waste is a continual occurrence. The adoption of modern, efficient, low-risk technologies is required on the global scale to convert incineration into a universally safe solution for plastic waste management.\n\n(15). Once plastic enters our oceans via coastlines, tides, rivers, and marine waters, its accumulation and dispersion patterns are determined by oceanic surface currents and winds. The buoyant nature of plastic allows it to float on oceanic surfaces, and because of being carried by the wind, plastics tend to agglomerate in oceanic gyres, with the greatest concentration at the center of ocean basins. Basins located in the Northern Hemisphere were recorded to have the greatest concentration of plastics, a predictable outcome because most of the world’s population resides within the Northern Hemisphere. Although the quantity of plastic clustered in Southern oceans was relatively lesser than in the Northern oceans, the amount was of the same order of magnitude as the Northern; this was surprising as there is a lack of coastal populations and plastic inputs in the Southern Hemisphere. This unexpected finding suggests that plastic pollution can be transported between oceanic gyres and basins to a significantly greater degree than once hypothesized.\n\n(16). So, what is the solution? A plethora of ideas has been suggested, with many underways. But, the question remains, will all, or any, of them, be successful? As Tom Downdall, the owner of Transformative Change Consulting, very aptly stated in response to the popular focus on recyclability and recycling: “Solving the plastic pollution crisis requires focus on another ‘R’—Responsibility.” If everyone, from multi-million-dollar companies to singular individuals, were to assume the responsibility and become intentional in their efforts to combat the plastic pollution crisis, then perhaps there might still be hope."

It can be presumed that incineration rates will be mentioned in such a section. Plastic waste disposal is discussed in paragraphs 11-14, with paragraph 12 discussing increasing incineration rates: “…by 2015, about half of the global plastic waste was discarded, a quarter incinerated, and another quarter recycled. Extrapolating historical trends to 2050, incineration rates are predicted to increase to 50%, recycling to 44%, and discarded waste is estimated to decline to a mere 6%.” This tells us that between 2015 and 2050, the incineration of plastic waste is predicted to increase from representing 25% of global plastic disposal to representing 50% of global plastic disposal. This two-fold increase can be written as a 100% increase. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",

      "text": "(1). The plastic pollution crisis has escalated to the point where it has now become a global issue. It is estimated that by 2030, the amount of plastic pollution on the planet will double; if this epidemic continues, by 2050, there will be far more plastic than fish in the sea. But how did this crisis begin?\n\n(2). Plastic is synthesized by assembling long-chain molecules from single repetitive units known as monomers; with the addition of heat, pressure, and catalysts, chemical reactions are performed to link such monomers together. Typically, the monomers used in plastic synthesis are derived from fossil fuels (crude oil and natural gas). Polyethylene terephthalate (or PET) is a commonly used polymer that is found in the manufacturing of bottles and clothing, while Bakelite, or polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, was the first synthetic plastic produced in 1907.\n\n(3). Global plastic production started to take off rapidly in the 1950s. While production was estimated to have been only 2 million tonnes annually in 1950, by 2015, plastic production was recorded to be 381 million tonnes per year, an increase of approximately 200-fold. By now, the world has already produced 78 billion tonnes of plastic.\n\n(4). After the end of the Second World War, materials developed for use during combat such as polyethylene (a product originally used to insulate radar cables), were adapted for post-war applications, and became widely used as consumer plastics. Prior to the mid-20th century, consumer goods were made from traditional materials like wood, glass, and metal. However, techniques such as injection molding allowed plastic to be produced more efficiently than these materials and in greater quantities, lowering their overall cost and making them more accessible to the growing middle class of the post-war era. The economic boom that followed the war further led to the growth of consumer culture and plastics rapidly became the material of choice for a wide range of goods, from kitchen utensils to children’s toys. Thus, plastics transformed everyday life, becoming integral to society as we know it today.\n\n(5). The appetite for plastic seems to stem from its irresistibly attractive qualities, such as its lightweight nature, flexibility, versatility, strength, water-resistant capacity, and most of all, its relatively cheap cost; however, people’s insatiable desire for the material has resulted in the over-consumption of plastic goods. Although its durability and slow-to-degrade nature allowed plastics to be utilized in mass production, the large-scale use of plastic has come at a high cost. Over time, plastic has lingered as waste, waste that has slowly suffocated wildlife, adversely impacted human health, and polluted the environment.\n\n(6). Improperly discarded plastic can impact our wildlife via three crucial routes, the first being “entanglement,” which is the entrapping, encircling, or constricting of marine animals by plastic debris. In most cases, wildlife becomes entangled in plastic ropes and netting and/or discarded fishing gear, while entanglement due to plastic packaging has also been documented.\n\n(7). The second route is via the “ingestion” of plastic, which can occur intentionally due to an animal mistaking plastic for food, or unintentionally and indirectly, for instance, via the ingestion of prey species that contain plastic. Additionally, tiny pieces of plastic such as plastic fibers may accidentally be taken up by filter-feeding oysters or mussels. As we travel upwards on the food chain, ingesting such toxic material becomes increasingly deadly due to bioaccumulation and thus, would pose a huge risk to iconic creatures such as sharks and other predators at the top of our ocean’s food chains. In larger fish, scientists have recorded the presence of cigarette packets, food packaging, and plastic films; in some extreme cases, a rope, hose, flowerpots, and plastic sheeting have been found in sperm whales. Consumption of large volumes of plastic can have varied biological effects, such as decreased stomach capacity, poor appetite, and a misleading sense of satiation. The specific impact of reduced food intake in certain organisms has been carefully investigated and documented by researchers. For instance, it results in a slower metabolic rate and survival in Asian green mussels, reduced reproducibility in copepods, reduced growth and development of langoustine, and decreased energy stores in shore crabs. Other effects include obstruction or perforation of the gut, gastric rupture, ulcerative lesions, and even death. Some of the biochemical responses to plastic ingestion are metabolic disruption, decreased enzyme activity, cellular necrosis, and oxidative stress.\n\n(8). The third crucial route by which plastic debris affects wildlife is through “interaction.” This includes contact with plastic waste through collisions, obstructions, and abrasions.

Plastic waste is commonly handled in one of three ways: through recycling, incineration (the burning of any given material), or disposal in landfills. A meta-study analyzed the impact of each method across factors, such as its global warming potential (GWP) and its total energy use (TEU). Across nearly all studies examined, recycling appears to be the most suitable option. Still, a few caveats must be noted. For instance, plastics can usually only be recycled once or twice; following this, they either end up in a landfill or must be incinerated. As such, recycling seems only to delay, rather than prevent, incineration and disposal. Also, recycling may not be the most economically favorable choice because recycled material is not necessarily a one-for-one displacement of primary plastic production. In other words, each tonne of recycled material does not prevent one tonne of primary material from being produced. This is due to the nature of the recycling process, which often results in products of lower economic value termed as “downcycling.”\n\n(12). In the 1980s and prior, plastic was largely discarded, while recycling and incineration were negligible. Incineration and recycling rates began to increase from 1980 and 1990, respectively, by approximately 0.7% per year; by 2015, about half of the global plastic waste was discarded, a quarter incinerated, and another quarter recycled. Extrapolating historical trends to 2050, incineration rates are predicted to increase to 50%, recycling to 44%, and discarded waste is estimated to decline to a mere 6%.\n\n(13). Although the potential increase in the recycling trend is to our advantage, the same cannot be said for the predicted incline in incineration rates. The burning of plastic can release toxic chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, heavy metals, and other carcinogens that can have adverse effects on the human body, but the horror does not stop there. Incineration of plastic has several environmental impacts as well – these include the production of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), which contributes to climate change, the incomplete combustion of Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), and Polystyrene (PS), which can release toxic gases such as carbon monoxide (CO). Additionally, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can produce dioxins, which are persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Therefore, to avoid such detrimental effects, it is necessary to prevent the open or uncontrolled incineration of plastics.\n\n(14). High-income countries have invested in the regulation of waste management and incinerator sites by monitoring the emissions and potential leakages to the environment. Modern incinerators have been designed to combat the issue of dioxins and other toxic emissions by ensuring efficient combustion, selective catalytic reduction, end-of-pipe treatment, and the addition of appropriate inhibitors. A testament to the success of such technologies has been evidenced by a study conducted in Belgium where no increase was recorded in the dioxin-serum levels of those working in municipal incinerator facilities compared to the high exposure rates they would have experienced if such methods were not in place. However, in low-to-middle income countries where such incinerator technologies are vastly absent and environmental regulations are laxer, the open burning of municipal waste is a continual occurrence. The adoption of modern, efficient, low-risk technologies is required on the global scale to convert incineration into a universally safe solution for plastic waste management.\n\n(15). Once plastic enters our oceans via coastlines, tides, rivers, and marine waters, its accumulation and dispersion patterns are determined by oceanic surface currents and winds. The buoyant nature of plastic allows it to float on oceanic surfaces, and because of being carried by the wind, plastics tend to agglomerate in oceanic gyres, with the greatest concentration at the center of ocean basins. Basins located in the Northern Hemisphere were recorded to have the greatest concentration of plastics, a predictable outcome because most of the world’s population resides within the Northern Hemisphere. Although the quantity of plastic clustered in Southern oceans was relatively lesser than in the Northern oceans, the amount was of the same order of magnitude as the Northern; this was surprising as there is a lack of coastal populations and plastic inputs in the Southern Hemisphere. This unexpected finding suggests that plastic pollution can be transported between oceanic gyres and basins to a significantly greater degree than once hypothesized.\n\n(16). So, what is the solution? A plethora of ideas has been suggested, with many underways. But, the question remains, will all, or any, of them, be successful? As Tom Downdall, the owner of Transformative Change Consulting, very aptly stated in response to the popular focus on recyclability and recycling: “Solving the plastic pollution crisis requires focus on another ‘R’—Responsibility.” If everyone, from multi-million-dollar companies to singular individuals, were to assume the responsibility and become intentional in their efforts to combat the plastic pollution crisis, then perhaps there might still be hope."

      "text": "(1). The plastic pollution crisis has escalated to the point where it has now become a global issue. It is estimated that by 2030, the amount of plastic pollution on the planet will double; if this epidemic continues, by 2050, there will be far more plastic than fish in the sea. But how did this crisis begin?\n\n(2). Plastic is synthesized by assembling long-chain molecules from single repetitive units known as monomers; with the addition of heat, pressure, and catalysts, chemical reactions are performed to link such monomers together. Typically, the monomers used in plastic synthesis are derived from fossil fuels (crude oil and natural gas). Polyethylene terephthalate (or PET) is a commonly used polymer that is found in the manufacturing of bottles and clothing, while Bakelite, or polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, was the first synthetic plastic produced in 1907.\n\n(3). Global plastic production started to take off rapidly in the 1950s. While production was estimated to have been only 2 million tonnes annually in 1950, by 2015, plastic production was recorded to be 381 million tonnes per year, an increase of approximately 200-fold. By now, the world has already produced 78 billion tonnes of plastic.\n\n(4). After the end of the Second World War, materials developed for use during combat such as polyethylene (a product originally used to insulate radar cables), were adapted for post-war applications, and became widely used as consumer plastics. Prior to the mid-20th century, consumer goods were made from traditional materials like wood, glass, and metal. However, techniques such as injection molding allowed plastic to be produced more efficiently than these materials and in greater quantities, lowering their overall cost and making them more accessible to the growing middle class of the post-war era. The economic boom that followed the war further led to the growth of consumer culture and plastics rapidly became the material of choice for a wide range of goods, from kitchen utensils to children’s toys. Thus, plastics transformed everyday life, becoming integral to society as we know it today.\n\n(5). The appetite for plastic seems to stem from its irresistibly attractive qualities, such as its lightweight nature, flexibility, versatility, strength, water-resistant capacity, and most of all, its relatively cheap cost; however, people’s insatiable desire for the material has resulted in the over-consumption of plastic goods. Although its durability and slow-to-degrade nature allowed plastics to be utilized in mass production, the large-scale use of plastic has come at a high cost. Over time, plastic has lingered as waste, waste that has slowly suffocated wildlife, adversely impacted human health, and polluted the environment.\n\n(6). Improperly discarded plastic can impact our wildlife via three crucial routes, the first being “entanglement,” which is the entrapping, encircling, or constricting of marine animals by plastic debris. In most cases, wildlife becomes entangled in plastic ropes and netting and/or discarded fishing gear, while entanglement due to plastic packaging has also been documented.\n\n(7). The second route is via the “ingestion” of plastic, which can occur intentionally due to an animal mistaking plastic for food, or unintentionally and indirectly, for instance, via the ingestion of prey species that contain plastic. Additionally, tiny pieces of plastic such as plastic fibers may accidentally be taken up by filter-feeding oysters or mussels. As we travel upwards on the food chain, ingesting such toxic material becomes increasingly deadly due to bioaccumulation and thus, would pose a huge risk to iconic creatures such as sharks and other predators at the top of our ocean’s food chains. In larger fish, scientists have recorded the presence of cigarette packets, food packaging, and plastic films; in some extreme cases, a rope, hose, flowerpots, and plastic sheeting have been found in sperm whales. Consumption of large volumes of plastic can have varied biological effects, such as decreased stomach capacity, poor appetite, and a misleading sense of satiation. The specific impact of reduced food intake in certain organisms has been carefully investigated and documented by researchers. For instance, it results in a slower metabolic rate and survival in Asian green mussels, reduced reproducibility in copepods, reduced growth and development of langoustine, and decreased energy stores in shore crabs. Other effects include obstruction or perforation of the gut, gastric rupture, ulcerative lesions, and even death. Some of the biochemical responses to plastic ingestion are metabolic disruption, decreased enzyme activity, cellular necrosis, and oxidative stress.\n\n(8). The third crucial route by which plastic debris affects wildlife is through “interaction.” This includes contact with plastic waste through collisions, obstructions, and abrasions. One simple example is fishing gear, which can cause damage to coral reef ecosystems and other marine wildlife upon collision. Plastic debris can also interfere with substrate availability and disrupt light penetration and oxygen exchange.\n\n(9). Research on the exposure and impact of microplastics (plastic particles >4.75 mm in diameter) on human health is ongoing. The smaller the particle size (micro-and nano-range), the greater the concern for human health. Possible routes of exposure to these minuscule particles include consumption through water and marine products, exposure to the skin via cosmetics, or inhalation of particles in the air. Research suggests that, for humans, the danger due to uptake of microplastics through diet is limited; microplastics appear to concentrate within the gut and the digestive tracts of fish, parts not typically consumed by humans. However, plastic fibers have also been detected in honey, beer, and table salt. To date, research only indicates negligible health risks from such exposure, though the mechanisms of microplastic interaction within the body are yet to be discovered, if at all. A study of North Sea fish suggested that plastic does not persist for a long duration within the organism; thus, one hypothesis is that plastic particles may directly exit through the GI tract without any negative impact, which would indeed bring about a wave of relief. However, such results may be met with skepticism and can perhaps only begin to be accepted once such studies are replicated, and findings are deemed reliable. It is hoped that future studies will better characterize the potential risks of microplastics and their impact on human health.\n\n(10). Although the long-term effects of microplastics on human health have not been proven, the consumption of these particles could potentially lead to a host of troubling issues. For instance, microplastics may irritate the lining of the digestive tract and, if able to enter vital organs such as the brain or liver, could disrupt the body’s normal functions. In the long term, the ingestion of microplastics may cause developmental, reproductive, and metabolic disorders. If microplastics were to carry with them dangerous microorganisms from the environment, this could also cause infections within the body. Microplastics may impact the human immune system, resulting in chronic inflammation or immune-related diseases. Additionally, it has been suggested that microplastics can cause cancer because certain additives in plastic are known to be carcinogenic, including a compound known as “styrene.” Repeated exposure to carcinogenic materials, such as through the repeated consumption of microplastics containing these particles, could feasibly increase one’s risk of the disease.\n\n(11).

Incineration of plastic has several environmental impacts as well – these include the production of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), which contributes to climate change, the incomplete combustion of Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), and Polystyrene (PS), which can release toxic gases such as carbon monoxide (CO). Additionally, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can produce dioxins, which are persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Therefore, to avoid such detrimental effects, it is necessary to prevent the open or uncontrolled incineration of plastics.\n\n(14). High-income countries have invested in the regulation of waste management and incinerator sites by monitoring the emissions and potential leakages to the environment. Modern incinerators have been designed to combat the issue of dioxins and other toxic emissions by ensuring efficient combustion, selective catalytic reduction, end-of-pipe treatment, and the addition of appropriate inhibitors. A testament to the success of such technologies has been evidenced by a study conducted in Belgium where no increase was recorded in the dioxin-serum levels of those working in municipal incinerator facilities compared to the high exposure rates they would have experienced if such methods were not in place. However, in low-to-middle income countries where such incinerator technologies are vastly absent and environmental regulations are laxer, the open burning of municipal waste is a continual occurrence. The adoption of modern, efficient, low-risk technologies is required on the global scale to convert incineration into a universally safe solution for plastic waste management.\n\n(15). Once plastic enters our oceans via coastlines, tides, rivers, and marine waters, its accumulation and dispersion patterns are determined by oceanic surface currents and winds. The buoyant nature of plastic allows it to float on oceanic surfaces, and because of being carried by the wind, plastics tend to agglomerate in oceanic gyres, with the greatest concentration at the center of ocean basins. Basins located in the Northern Hemisphere were recorded to have the greatest concentration of plastics, a predictable outcome because most of the world’s population resides within the Northern Hemisphere. Although the quantity of plastic clustered in Southern oceans was relatively lesser than in the Northern oceans, the amount was of the same order of magnitude as the Northern; this was surprising as there is a lack of coastal populations and plastic inputs in the Southern Hemisphere. This unexpected finding suggests that plastic pollution can be transported between oceanic gyres and basins to a significantly greater degree than once hypothesized.\n\n(16). So, what is the solution? A plethora of ideas has been suggested, with many underways. But, the question remains, will all, or any, of them, be successful? As Tom Downdall, the owner of Transformative Change Consulting, very aptly stated in response to the popular focus on recyclability and recycling: “Solving the plastic pollution crisis requires focus on another ‘R’—Responsibility.” If everyone, from multi-million-dollar companies to singular individuals, were to assume the responsibility and become intentional in their efforts to combat the plastic pollution crisis, then perhaps there might still be hope."

However, such results may be met with skepticism and can perhaps only begin to be accepted once such studies are replicated, and findings are deemed reliable.” By reading this paragraph carefully, we can see that the author acknowledges more studies are needed to increase the robustness of the given hypothesis.

      "poe_text": "Option A. With pessimism – is incorrect because pessimism means a tendency to see the worst aspect of things or believe that the worst will happen; a lack of hope or confidence in the future. Based on paragraph 9, there are no perceived negative thoughts/attitudes towards the hypothesis, thus this term is not the best description. Option B. With objectivity – is incorrect because objectivity means a lack of bias, judgment, prejudice. Although the author is mostly neutral with regards to this hypothesis, clues are provided with regards to their thoughts, thus this is not the best description. Option D.

      "text": "(1). The plastic pollution crisis has escalated to the point where it has now become a global issue. It is estimated that by 2030, the amount of plastic pollution on the planet will double; if this epidemic continues, by 2050, there will be far more plastic than fish in the sea. But how did this crisis begin?\n\n(2). Plastic is synthesized by assembling long-chain molecules from single repetitive units known as monomers; with the addition of heat, pressure, and catalysts, chemical reactions are performed to link such monomers together. Typically, the monomers used in plastic synthesis are derived from fossil fuels (crude oil and natural gas). Polyethylene terephthalate (or PET) is a commonly used polymer that is found in the manufacturing of bottles and clothing, while Bakelite, or polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, was the first synthetic plastic produced in 1907.\n\n(3). Global plastic production started to take off rapidly in the 1950s. While production was estimated to have been only 2 million tonnes annually in 1950, by 2015, plastic production was recorded to be 381 million tonnes per year, an increase of approximately 200-fold. By now, the world has already produced 78 billion tonnes of plastic.\n\n(4). After the end of the Second World War, materials developed for use during combat such as polyethylene (a product originally used to insulate radar cables), were adapted for post-war applications, and became widely used as consumer plastics. Prior to the mid-20th century, consumer goods were made from traditional materials like wood, glass, and metal. However, techniques such as injection molding allowed plastic to be produced more efficiently than these materials and in greater quantities, lowering their overall cost and making them more accessible to the growing middle class of the post-war era. The economic boom that followed the war further led to the growth of consumer culture and plastics rapidly became the material of choice for a wide range of goods, from kitchen utensils to children’s toys. Thus, plastics transformed everyday life, becoming integral to society as we know it today.\n\n(5). The appetite for plastic seems to stem from its irresistibly attractive qualities, such as its lightweight nature, flexibility, versatility, strength, water-resistant capacity, and most of all, its relatively cheap cost; however, people’s insatiable desire for the material has resulted in the over-consumption of plastic goods. Although its durability and slow-to-degrade nature allowed plastics to be utilized in mass production, the large-scale use of plastic has come at a high cost. Over time, plastic has lingered as waste, waste that has slowly suffocated wildlife, adversely impacted human health, and polluted the environment.\n\n(6). Improperly discarded plastic can impact our wildlife via three crucial routes, the first being “entanglement,” which is the entrapping, encircling, or constricting of marine animals by plastic debris. In most cases, wildlife becomes entangled in plastic ropes and netting and/or discarded fishing gear, while entanglement due to plastic packaging has also been documented.\n\n(7). The second route is via the “ingestion” of plastic, which can occur intentionally due to an animal mistaking plastic for food, or unintentionally and indirectly, for instance, via the ingestion of prey species that contain plastic. Additionally, tiny pieces of plastic such as plastic fibers may accidentally be taken up by filter-feeding oysters or mussels. As we travel upwards on the food chain, ingesting such toxic material becomes increasingly deadly due to bioaccumulation and thus, would pose a huge risk to iconic creatures such as sharks and other predators at the top of our ocean’s food chains. In larger fish, scientists have recorded the presence of cigarette packets, food packaging, and plastic films; in some extreme cases, a rope, hose, flowerpots, and plastic sheeting have been found in sperm whales. Consumption of large volumes of plastic can have varied biological effects, such as decreased stomach capacity, poor appetite, and a misleading sense of satiation. The specific impact of reduced food intake in certain organisms has been carefully investigated and documented by researchers. For instance, it results in a slower metabolic rate and survival in Asian green mussels, reduced reproducibility in copepods, reduced growth and development of langoustine, and decreased energy stores in shore crabs. Other effects include obstruction or perforation of the gut, gastric rupture, ulcerative lesions, and even death. Some of the biochemical responses to plastic ingestion are metabolic disruption, decreased enzyme activity, cellular necrosis, and oxidative stress.\n\n(8). The third crucial route by which plastic debris affects wildlife is through “interaction.” This includes contact with plastic waste through collisions, obstructions, and abrasions. One simple example is fishing gear, which can cause damage to coral reef ecosystems and other marine wildlife upon collision. Plastic debris can also interfere with substrate availability and disrupt light penetration and oxygen exchange.\n\n(9). Research on the exposure and impact of microplastics (plastic particles >4.75 mm in diameter) on human health is ongoing. The smaller the particle size (micro-and nano-range), the greater the concern for human health. Possible routes of exposure to these minuscule particles include consumption through water and marine products, exposure to the skin via cosmetics, or inhalation of particles in the air. Research suggests that, for humans, the danger due to uptake of microplastics through diet is limited; microplastics appear to concentrate within the gut and the digestive tracts of fish, parts not typically consumed by humans. However, plastic fibers have also been detected in honey, beer, and table salt. To date, research only indicates negligible health risks from such exposure, though the mechanisms of microplastic interaction within the body are yet to be discovered, if at all. A study of North Sea fish suggested that plastic does not persist for a long duration within the organism; thus, one hypothesis is that plastic particles may directly exit through the GI tract without any negative impact, which would indeed bring about a wave of relief. However, such results may be met with skepticism and can perhaps only begin to be accepted once such studies are replicated, and findings are deemed reliable. It is hoped that future studies will better characterize the potential risks of microplastics and their impact on human health.\n\n(10). Although the long-term effects of microplastics on human health have not been proven, the consumption of these particles could potentially lead to a host of troubling issues. For instance, microplastics may irritate the lining of the digestive tract and, if able to enter vital organs such as the brain or liver, could disrupt the body’s normal functions. In the long term, the ingestion of microplastics may cause developmental, reproductive, and metabolic disorders. If microplastics were to carry with them dangerous microorganisms from the environment, this could also cause infections within the body. Microplastics may impact the human immune system, resulting in chronic inflammation or immune-related diseases. Additionally, it has been suggested that microplastics can cause cancer because certain additives in plastic are known to be carcinogenic, including a compound known as “styrene.” Repeated exposure to carcinogenic materials, such as through the repeated consumption of microplastics containing these particles, could feasibly increase one’s risk of the disease.\n\n(11). Plastic waste is commonly handled in one of three ways: through recycling, incineration (the burning of any given material), or disposal in landfills. A meta-study analyzed the impact of each method across factors, such as its global warming potential (GWP) and its total energy use (TEU). Across nearly all studies examined, recycling appears to be the most suitable option. Still, a few caveats must be noted. For instance, plastics can usually only be recycled once or twice; following this, they either end up in a landfill or must be incinerated. As such, recycling seems only to delay, rather than prevent, incineration and disposal. Also, recycling may not be the most economically favorable choice because recycled material is not necessarily a one-for-one displacement of primary plastic production. In other words, each tonne of recycled material does not prevent one tonne of primary material from being produced. This is due to the nature of the recycling process, which often results in products of lower economic value termed as “downcycling.”\n\n(12). In the 1980s and prior, plastic was largely discarded, while recycling and incineration were negligible. Incineration and recycling rates began to increase from 1980 and 1990, respectively, by approximately 0.7% per year; by 2015, about half of the global plastic waste was discarded, a quarter incinerated, and another quarter recycled. Extrapolating historical trends to 2050, incineration rates are predicted to increase to 50%, recycling to 44%, and discarded waste is estimated to decline to a mere 6%.\n\n(13). Although the potential increase in the recycling trend is to our advantage, the same cannot be said for the predicted incline in incineration rates. The burning of plastic can release toxic chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, heavy metals, and other carcinogens that can have adverse effects on the human body, but the horror does not stop there.

      "text": "(1). The plastic pollution crisis has escalated to the point where it has now become a global issue. It is estimated that by 2030, the amount of plastic pollution on the planet will double; if this epidemic continues, by 2050, there will be far more plastic than fish in the sea. But how did this crisis begin?\n\n(2). Plastic is synthesized by assembling long-chain molecules from single repetitive units known as monomers; with the addition of heat, pressure, and catalysts, chemical reactions are performed to link such monomers together. Typically, the monomers used in plastic synthesis are derived from fossil fuels (crude oil and natural gas). Polyethylene terephthalate (or PET) is a commonly used polymer that is found in the manufacturing of bottles and clothing, while Bakelite, or polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, was the first synthetic plastic produced in 1907.\n\n(3). Global plastic production started to take off rapidly in the 1950s. While production was estimated to have been only 2 million tonnes annually in 1950, by 2015, plastic production was recorded to be 381 million tonnes per year, an increase of approximately 200-fold. By now, the world has already produced 78 billion tonnes of plastic.\n\n(4). After the end of the Second World War, materials developed for use during combat such as polyethylene (a product originally used to insulate radar cables), were adapted for post-war applications, and became widely used as consumer plastics. Prior to the mid-20th century, consumer goods were made from traditional materials like wood, glass, and metal. However, techniques such as injection molding allowed plastic to be produced more efficiently than these materials and in greater quantities, lowering their overall cost and making them more accessible to the growing middle class of the post-war era. The economic boom that followed the war further led to the growth of consumer culture and plastics rapidly became the material of choice for a wide range of goods, from kitchen utensils to children’s toys. Thus, plastics transformed everyday life, becoming integral to society as we know it today.\n\n(5). The appetite for plastic seems to stem from its irresistibly attractive qualities, such as its lightweight nature, flexibility, versatility, strength, water-resistant capacity, and most of all, its relatively cheap cost; however, people’s insatiable desire for the material has resulted in the over-consumption of plastic goods. Although its durability and slow-to-degrade nature allowed plastics to be utilized in mass production, the large-scale use of plastic has come at a high cost. Over time, plastic has lingered as waste, waste that has slowly suffocated wildlife, adversely impacted human health, and polluted the environment.\n\n(6). Improperly discarded plastic can impact our wildlife via three crucial routes, the first being “entanglement,” which is the entrapping, encircling, or constricting of marine animals by plastic debris. In most cases, wildlife becomes entangled in plastic ropes and netting and/or discarded fishing gear, while entanglement due to plastic packaging has also been documented.\n\n(7). The second route is via the “ingestion” of plastic, which can occur intentionally due to an animal mistaking plastic for food, or unintentionally and indirectly, for instance, via the ingestion of prey species that contain plastic. Additionally, tiny pieces of plastic such as plastic fibers may accidentally be taken up by filter-feeding oysters or mussels. As we travel upwards on the food chain, ingesting such toxic material becomes increasingly deadly due to bioaccumulation and thus, would pose a huge risk to iconic creatures such as sharks and other predators at the top of our ocean’s food chains. In larger fish, scientists have recorded the presence of cigarette packets, food packaging, and plastic films; in some extreme cases, a rope, hose, flowerpots, and plastic sheeting have been found in sperm whales. Consumption of large volumes of plastic can have varied biological effects, such as decreased stomach capacity, poor appetite, and a misleading sense of satiation. The specific impact of reduced food intake in certain organisms has been carefully investigated and documented by researchers. For instance, it results in a slower metabolic rate and survival in Asian green mussels, reduced reproducibility in copepods, reduced growth and development of langoustine, and decreased energy stores in shore crabs. Other effects include obstruction or perforation of the gut, gastric rupture, ulcerative lesions, and even death. Some of the biochemical responses to plastic ingestion are metabolic disruption, decreased enzyme activity, cellular necrosis, and oxidative stress.\n\n(8). The third crucial route by which plastic debris affects wildlife is through “interaction.” This includes contact with plastic waste through collisions, obstructions, and abrasions. One simple example is fishing gear, which can cause damage to coral reef ecosystems and other marine wildlife upon collision. Plastic debris can also interfere with substrate availability and disrupt light penetration and oxygen exchange.\n\n(9). Research on the exposure and impact of microplastics (plastic particles >4.75 mm in diameter) on human health is ongoing. The smaller the particle size (micro-and nano-range), the greater the concern for human health. Possible routes of exposure to these minuscule particles include consumption through water and marine products, exposure to the skin via cosmetics, or inhalation of particles in the air. Research suggests that, for humans, the danger due to uptake of microplastics through diet is limited; microplastics appear to concentrate within the gut and the digestive tracts of fish, parts not typically consumed by humans. However, plastic fibers have also been detected in honey, beer, and table salt. To date, research only indicates negligible health risks from such exposure, though the mechanisms of microplastic interaction within the body are yet to be discovered, if at all. A study of North Sea fish suggested that plastic does not persist for a long duration within the organism; thus, one hypothesis is that plastic particles may directly exit through the GI tract without any negative impact, which would indeed bring about a wave of relief. However, such results may be met with skepticism and can perhaps only begin to be accepted once such studies are replicated, and findings are deemed reliable. It is hoped that future studies will better characterize the potential risks of microplastics and their impact on human health.\n\n(10). Although the long-term effects of microplastics on human health have not been proven, the consumption of these particles could potentially lead to a host of troubling issues. For instance, microplastics may irritate the lining of the digestive tract and, if able to enter vital organs such as the brain or liver, could disrupt the body’s normal functions. In the long term, the ingestion of microplastics may cause developmental, reproductive, and metabolic disorders. If microplastics were to carry with them dangerous microorganisms from the environment, this could also cause infections within the body. Microplastics may impact the human immune system, resulting in chronic inflammation or immune-related diseases. Additionally, it has been suggested that microplastics can cause cancer because certain additives in plastic are known to be carcinogenic, including a compound known as “styrene.” Repeated exposure to carcinogenic materials, such as through the repeated consumption of microplastics containing these particles, could feasibly increase one’s risk of the disease.\n\n(11). Plastic waste is commonly handled in one of three ways: through recycling, incineration (the burning of any given material), or disposal in landfills. A meta-study analyzed the impact of each method across factors, such as its global warming potential (GWP) and its total energy use (TEU). Across nearly all studies examined, recycling appears to be the most suitable option. Still, a few caveats must be noted. For instance, plastics can usually only be recycled once or twice; following this, they either end up in a landfill or must be incinerated. As such, recycling seems only to delay, rather than prevent, incineration and disposal. Also, recycling may not be the most economically favorable choice because recycled material is not necessarily a one-for-one displacement of primary plastic production. In other words, each tonne of recycled material does not prevent one tonne of primary material from being produced. This is due to the nature of the recycling process, which often results in products of lower economic value termed as “downcycling.”\n\n(12). In the 1980s and prior, plastic was largely discarded, while recycling and incineration were negligible. Incineration and recycling rates began to increase from 1980 and 1990, respectively, by approximately 0.7% per year; by 2015, about half of the global plastic waste was discarded, a quarter incinerated, and another quarter recycled. Extrapolating historical trends to 2050, incineration rates are predicted to increase to 50%, recycling to 44%, and discarded waste is estimated to decline to a mere 6%.\n\n(13). Although the potential increase in the recycling trend is to our advantage, the same cannot be said for the predicted incline in incineration rates. The burning of plastic can release toxic chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, heavy metals, and other carcinogens that can have adverse effects on the human body, but the horror does not stop there. Incineration of plastic has several environmental impacts as well – these include the production of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), which contributes to climate change, the incomplete combustion of Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), and Polystyrene (PS), which can release toxic gases such as carbon monoxide (CO). Additionally, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can produce dioxins, which are persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Therefore, to avoid such detrimental effects, it is necessary to prevent the open or uncontrolled incineration of plastics.\n\n(14). High-income countries have invested in the regulation of waste management and incinerator sites by monitoring the emissions and potential leakages to the environment. Modern incinerators have been designed to combat the issue of dioxins and other toxic emissions by ensuring efficient combustion, selective catalytic reduction, end-of-pipe treatment, and the addition of appropriate inhibitors. A testament to the success of such technologies has been evidenced by a study conducted in Belgium where no increase was recorded in the dioxin-serum levels of those working in municipal incinerator facilities compared to the high exposure rates they would have experienced if such methods were not in place. However, in low-to-middle income countries where such incinerator technologies are vastly absent and environmental regulations are laxer, the open burning of municipal waste is a continual occurrence. The adoption of modern, efficient, low-risk technologies is required on the global scale to convert incineration into a universally safe solution for plastic waste management.\n\n(15). Once plastic enters our oceans via coastlines, tides, rivers, and marine waters, its accumulation and dispersion patterns are determined by oceanic surface currents and winds. The buoyant nature of plastic allows it to float on oceanic surfaces, and because of being carried by the wind, plastics tend to agglomerate in oceanic gyres, with the greatest concentration at the center of ocean basins. Basins located in the Northern Hemisphere were recorded to have the greatest concentration of plastics, a predictable outcome because most of the world’s population resides within the Northern Hemisphere. Although the quantity of plastic clustered in Southern oceans was relatively lesser than in the Northern oceans, the amount was of the same order of magnitude as the Northern; this was surprising as there is a lack of coastal populations and plastic inputs in the Southern Hemisphere. This unexpected finding suggests that plastic pollution can be transported between oceanic gyres and basins to a significantly greater degree than once hypothesized.\n\n(16). So, what is the solution? A plethora of ideas has been suggested, with many underways. But, the question remains, will all, or any, of them, be successful?

      "text": "(1). The plastic pollution crisis has escalated to the point where it has now become a global issue. It is estimated that by 2030, the amount of plastic pollution on the planet will double; if this epidemic continues, by 2050, there will be far more plastic than fish in the sea. But how did this crisis begin?\n\n(2). Plastic is synthesized by assembling long-chain molecules from single repetitive units known as monomers; with the addition of heat, pressure, and catalysts, chemical reactions are performed to link such monomers together. Typically, the monomers used in plastic synthesis are derived from fossil fuels (crude oil and natural gas). Polyethylene terephthalate (or PET) is a commonly used polymer that is found in the manufacturing of bottles and clothing, while Bakelite, or polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, was the first synthetic plastic produced in 1907.\n\n(3). Global plastic production started to take off rapidly in the 1950s. While production was estimated to have been only 2 million tonnes annually in 1950, by 2015, plastic production was recorded to be 381 million tonnes per year, an increase of approximately 200-fold. By now, the world has already produced 78 billion tonnes of plastic.\n\n(4). After the end of the Second World War, materials developed for use during combat such as polyethylene (a product originally used to insulate radar cables), were adapted for post-war applications, and became widely used as consumer plastics. Prior to the mid-20th century, consumer goods were made from traditional materials like wood, glass, and metal. However, techniques such as injection molding allowed plastic to be produced more efficiently than these materials and in greater quantities, lowering their overall cost and making them more accessible to the growing middle class of the post-war era. The economic boom that followed the war further led to the growth of consumer culture and plastics rapidly became the material of choice for a wide range of goods, from kitchen utensils to children’s toys. Thus, plastics transformed everyday life, becoming integral to society as we know it today.\n\n(5). The appetite for plastic seems to stem from its irresistibly attractive qualities, such as its lightweight nature, flexibility, versatility, strength, water-resistant capacity, and most of all, its relatively cheap cost; however, people’s insatiable desire for the material has resulted in the over-consumption of plastic goods. Although its durability and slow-to-degrade nature allowed plastics to be utilized in mass production, the large-scale use of plastic has come at a high cost. Over time, plastic has lingered as waste, waste that has slowly suffocated wildlife, adversely impacted human health, and polluted the environment.\n\n(6). Improperly discarded plastic can impact our wildlife via three crucial routes, the first being “entanglement,” which is the entrapping, encircling, or constricting of marine animals by plastic debris. In most cases, wildlife becomes entangled in plastic ropes and netting and/or discarded fishing gear, while entanglement due to plastic packaging has also been documented.\n\n(7). The second route is via the “ingestion” of plastic, which can occur intentionally due to an animal mistaking plastic for food, or unintentionally and indirectly, for instance, via the ingestion of prey species that contain plastic. Additionally, tiny pieces of plastic such as plastic fibers may accidentally be taken up by filter-feeding oysters or mussels. As we travel upwards on the food chain, ingesting such toxic material becomes increasingly deadly due to bioaccumulation and thus, would pose a huge risk to iconic creatures such as sharks and other predators at the top of our ocean’s food chains. In larger fish, scientists have recorded the presence of cigarette packets, food packaging, and plastic films; in some extreme cases, a rope, hose, flowerpots, and plastic sheeting have been found in sperm whales. Consumption of large volumes of plastic can have varied biological effects, such as decreased stomach capacity, poor appetite, and a misleading sense of satiation. The specific impact of reduced food intake in certain organisms has been carefully investigated and documented by researchers. For instance, it results in a slower metabolic rate and survival in Asian green mussels, reduced reproducibility in copepods, reduced growth and development of langoustine, and decreased energy stores in shore crabs. Other effects include obstruction or perforation of the gut, gastric rupture, ulcerative lesions, and even death. Some of the biochemical responses to plastic ingestion are metabolic disruption, decreased enzyme activity, cellular necrosis, and oxidative stress.\n\n(8). The third crucial route by which plastic debris affects wildlife is through “interaction.” This includes contact with plastic waste through collisions, obstructions, and abrasions. One simple example is fishing gear, which can cause damage to coral reef ecosystems and other marine wildlife upon collision. Plastic debris can also interfere with substrate availability and disrupt light penetration and oxygen exchange.\n\n(9). Research on the exposure and impact of microplastics (plastic particles >4.75 mm in diameter) on human health is ongoing. The smaller the particle size (micro-and nano-range), the greater the concern for human health. Possible routes of exposure to these minuscule particles include consumption through water and marine products, exposure to the skin via cosmetics, or inhalation of particles in the air. Research suggests that, for humans, the danger due to uptake of microplastics through diet is limited; microplastics appear to concentrate within the gut and the digestive tracts of fish, parts not typically consumed by humans. However, plastic fibers have also been detected in honey, beer, and table salt. To date, research only indicates negligible health risks from such exposure, though the mechanisms of microplastic interaction within the body are yet to be discovered, if at all. A study of North Sea fish suggested that plastic does not persist for a long duration within the organism; thus, one hypothesis is that plastic particles may directly exit through the GI tract without any negative impact, which would indeed bring about a wave of relief. However, such results may be met with skepticism and can perhaps only begin to be accepted once such studies are replicated, and findings are deemed reliable. It is hoped that future studies will better characterize the potential risks of microplastics and their impact on human health.\n\n(10). Although the long-term effects of microplastics on human health have not been proven, the consumption of these particles could potentially lead to a host of troubling issues. For instance, microplastics may irritate the lining of the digestive tract and, if able to enter vital organs such as the brain or liver, could disrupt the body’s normal functions. In the long term, the ingestion of microplastics may cause developmental, reproductive, and metabolic disorders. If microplastics were to carry with them dangerous microorganisms from the environment, this could also cause infections within the body. Microplastics may impact the human immune system, resulting in chronic inflammation or immune-related diseases. Additionally, it has been suggested that microplastics can cause cancer because certain additives in plastic are known to be carcinogenic, including a compound known as “styrene.” Repeated exposure to carcinogenic materials, such as through the repeated consumption of microplastics containing these particles, could feasibly increase one’s risk of the disease.\n\n(11). Plastic waste is commonly handled in one of three ways: through recycling, incineration (the burning of any given material), or disposal in landfills. A meta-study analyzed the impact of each method across factors, such as its global warming potential (GWP) and its total energy use (TEU). Across nearly all studies examined, recycling appears to be the most suitable option. Still, a few caveats must be noted. For instance, plastics can usually only be recycled once or twice; following this, they either end up in a landfill or must be incinerated. As such, recycling seems only to delay, rather than prevent, incineration and disposal. Also, recycling may not be the most economically favorable choice because recycled material is not necessarily a one-for-one displacement of primary plastic production. In other words, each tonne of recycled material does not prevent one tonne of primary material from being produced. This is due to the nature of the recycling process, which often results in products of lower economic value termed as “downcycling.”\n\n(12). In the 1980s and prior, plastic was largely discarded, while recycling and incineration were negligible. Incineration and recycling rates began to increase from 1980 and 1990, respectively, by approximately 0.7% per year; by 2015, about half of the global plastic waste was discarded, a quarter incinerated, and another quarter recycled. Extrapolating historical trends to 2050, incineration rates are predicted to increase to 50%, recycling to 44%, and discarded waste is estimated to decline to a mere 6%.\n\n(13). Although the potential increase in the recycling trend is to our advantage, the same cannot be said for the predicted incline in incineration rates. The burning of plastic can release toxic chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, heavy metals, and other carcinogens that can have adverse effects on the human body, but the horror does not stop there. Incineration of plastic has several environmental impacts as well – these include the production of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), which contributes to climate change, the incomplete combustion of Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), and Polystyrene (PS), which can release toxic gases such as carbon monoxide (CO). Additionally, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can produce dioxins, which are persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Therefore, to avoid such detrimental effects, it is necessary to prevent the open or uncontrolled incineration of plastics.\n\n(14). High-income countries have invested in the regulation of waste management and incinerator sites by monitoring the emissions and potential leakages to the environment. Modern incinerators have been designed to combat the issue of dioxins and other toxic emissions by ensuring efficient combustion, selective catalytic reduction, end-of-pipe treatment, and the addition of appropriate inhibitors. A testament to the success of such technologies has been evidenced by a study conducted in Belgium where no increase was recorded in the dioxin-serum levels of those working in municipal incinerator facilities compared to the high exposure rates they would have experienced if such methods were not in place. However, in low-to-middle income countries where such incinerator technologies are vastly absent and environmental regulations are laxer, the open burning of municipal waste is a continual occurrence. The adoption of modern, efficient, low-risk technologies is required on the global scale to convert incineration into a universally safe solution for plastic waste management.\n\n(15). Once plastic enters our oceans via coastlines, tides, rivers, and marine waters, its accumulation and dispersion patterns are determined by oceanic surface currents and winds. The buoyant nature of plastic allows it to float on oceanic surfaces, and because of being carried by the wind, plastics tend to agglomerate in oceanic gyres, with the greatest concentration at the center of ocean basins. Basins located in the Northern Hemisphere were recorded to have the greatest concentration of plastics, a predictable outcome because most of the world’s population resides within the Northern Hemisphere. Although the quantity of plastic clustered in Southern oceans was relatively lesser than in the Northern oceans, the amount was of the same order of magnitude as the Northern; this was surprising as there is a lack of coastal populations and plastic inputs in the Southern Hemisphere. This unexpected finding suggests that plastic pollution can be transported between oceanic gyres and basins to a significantly greater degree than once hypothesized.\n\n(16). So, what is the solution? A plethora of ideas has been suggested, with many underways. But, the question remains, will all, or any, of them, be successful? As Tom Downdall, the owner of Transformative Change Consulting, very aptly stated in response to the popular focus on recyclability and recycling: “Solving the plastic pollution crisis requires focus on another ‘R’—Responsibility.” If everyone, from multi-million-dollar companies to singular individuals, were to assume the responsibility and become intentional in their efforts to combat the plastic pollution crisis, then perhaps there might still be hope."

Additionally, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can produce dioxins, which are persistent organic pollutants (POPs).” This tells us that the incineration of plastic produces carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and POPs. Carbon disulfide is the only answer choice NOT mentioned. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",

      "text": "(1). Alfred Binet was unlike other Psychologists at the beginning of the 20 th century. The primary focus of psychology at this time was understanding people who were different from the norm. This included why people felt, acted, or thought in unusual ways. Interestingly, Binet was interested in the very opposite of this notion. He wanted to define what was normal, specifically relating to mental capacity and intelligence. What defines an individual as highly intelligent, and where is the average?\n\n(2). Binet began to understand that many people were considered smart because they understood the laws of physics or could recite Shakespearean literature. He considered these skills as outcomes of higher education, which made him wonder if there was a way to measure intelligence regardless of education.\n\n(3). Binet proceeded to design a test to quantify the innate ability of a normal person. This would help French officials identify students who were in danger of falling behind in school. This innate ability was, and still is, referred to as an intelligence quotient, or IQ for short. Binet’s original test for children had them put things in order and identify patterns, to which education offered no advantage.\n\n(4). IQ is reported as a number on a scale, with 100 being the average for an individual’s age. Consider a 7-year-old boy who scores an IQ of 100 on Binet’s test. This boy is theoretically able to perform Binet’s tasks just as well as most other 7-year-olds. However, if he were to score a 110, he would be above average for his age. Mathematically, a large random sample of 7-year-old kids would have an average IQ score of 100. This marks the 50 th percentile, as a score of 100 will be higher than 50% of the group. 34% of the kids would have an IQ score between 85 and 100, and another 34% of the kids would score between 100 and 115. This means that 68% of the kids will score within 85 and 115. All the percentage ranges below an IQ score of 115 add up to 84%. This means that this score marks the 84 th percentile, as 84% of individuals will score below 115. This symmetrical standard distribution of test scores is commonly known as the bell curve (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Standard bell curve of IQ test scores\n\n(5). Theoretically, an individual’s IQ will stay the same throughout one’s life, as there are different tests for different ages. A 7-year-old will be scored against the average 7-year-old. When that same child is 10 years old, he will be scored against other 10-year-old children with more challenging questions, or more difficult grading schemes. The type of IQ test also plays an important role, as there are multiple tests currently available.\n\n(6). Lewis Terman of Stanford University developed the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test, which is an American adaptation of Binet’s original French test. Psychologist David Wechsler did not like either of these tests as they required a good grasp of language to do well. What if someone had a reading disability or poor linguistic education? The resulting IQ test is known as the Weschler Intelligence Scale, and consists of two parts. The first part is much like the Stanford-Binet test; it is called a verbal IQ score and is often close to a person’s Stanford-Binet IQ. The second part includes tasks that don’t require people to be good with words. For instance, identifying patterns in pictures is one of several wordless tasks. This part yields a performance IQ score, which may be extremely different from one’s verbal IQ score. Discrepancies in these two scores may help psychologists and teachers identify the presence of a language deficiency or reading disability. A third and final IQ score produced by the Wechsler scale is overall IQ, which averages the performance IQ and verbal IQ. Consistently, all IQ tests will exhibit a standard bell curve of scores within a random sample, with 100 always representing the average score.\n\n(7). Standardized reading comprehension assessments also score participants in a standard bell curve with an average of 100, but they do not indicate IQ. They merely indicate a global view of a child’s reading ability, which may provide useful instructions and interventions to improve reading capabilities. The Simple View of Reading (SVR) is a framework that identifies word recognition and oral language comprehension as the two primary components involved in reading comprehension. An SVR standardized reading comprehension assessment will thereby grade students on these two components.\n\n(8). Word recognition encompasses phonological awareness, automaticity of word recognition, and other phonic skills. There are three subtests that grade these skills: (1) word attack, which has students sound out gibberish words; (2) word identification, which analyzes a student’s verbal pronunciation while reading a passage; (3) spelling, which has students spell simple and complex words. The scores of these three tests will indicate how a student’s word recognition abilities compare to other students of the same age.\n\n(9). Oral Language comprehension encompasses oral vocabulary, morphology, sentence comprehension, and pragmatic language. There are three subtests that grade these skills: (1) listening comprehension, which tests a student’s ability to recall a verbal story; (2) reading comprehension, which tests a student’s ability to recall a written passage; (3) vocabulary, which tests the quantity of words that a student knows. The scores of these three tests indicate how a student’s oral language comprehension abilities compare to other students of the same age.\n\n(10). Consider Abby, a fourth-grade student who recently completed an SVR standardized reading comprehension assessment (Table 1). Abby can effectively recall details of stories read aloud, recall details from written passages, and is able to consistently use accurate vocabulary in speech. On the other hand, her reading is not fluent, her reading pace is slow, she frequently sounds out written words, and her spelling is below average. Her test results indicate weak word recognition skills and strong oral language comprehension skills (Table 1).\n\nTable 1: Abby’s test results\n\nPrimary Skill\n\nSubtest\n\nScore\n\nOral Language Comprehension\n\nListening Comprehension\n\n115\n\nReading Comprehension\n\n100\n\nVocabulary\n\n115\n\nWord Recognition\n\nWord Attack\n\n70\n\nWord Identification\n\n85\n\nSpelling\n\n72\n\n(11). Abby’s test scores, which indicate strong oral language comprehension skills and poor word recognition skills, is referred to as a first profile reading difficulty. Students under this profile may perform well in class discussions, but will have trouble on spelling and reading tests. In severe cases, this profile can indicate the presence of SLD/Dyslexia. A second profile reading disorder is classified by the opposite; strong word recognition skills and weak oral language comprehension. Students under this profile may perform well on spelling and reading tests, but will have difficulties expressing their ideas and comprehending verbal lectures. Finally, a third profile reading difficulty is indicated by a mix of strengths and weaknesses in both word recognition and oral language comprehension, with no clear discrepancy between the two.\n\n(12). Importantly, taking a standardized test is completely optional. Parents do not necessarily need their children to take any of these tests. However, the information received from the results of a child’s performance can provide information regarding their intellectual development and potential, which may identify the need for additional educational resources that target areas of weakness."

You can also obtain this answer by assessing Abby’s score and using passage information to arrive at the same conclusion. For example, paragraph 8 states: “There are three subtests that grade these [word recognition] skills: (1) word attack, which has students sound out gibberish words; (2) word identification, which analyzes a student’s verbal pronunciation while reading a passage; (3) spelling, which has students spell simple and complex words.” This illustrates that word attack is a skill that indicates word recognition abilities, amongst others.

To interpret Abby’s score, refer to the passage’s discussion on evaluating IQ scores, which can be found in paragraph 4. Specifically, Figure 1, which displays a standard bell curve distribution, can be used to identify what percentile Abby’s score falls under.

Consistently, all IQ tests will exhibit a standard bell curve of scores within a random sample, with 100 always representing the average score.\n\n(7). Standardized reading comprehension assessments also score participants in a standard bell curve with an average of 100, but they do not indicate IQ. They merely indicate a global view of a child’s reading ability, which may provide useful instructions and interventions to improve reading capabilities. The Simple View of Reading (SVR) is a framework that identifies word recognition and oral language comprehension as the two primary components involved in reading comprehension. An SVR standardized reading comprehension assessment will thereby grade students on these two components.\n\n(8). Word recognition encompasses phonological awareness, automaticity of word recognition, and other phonic skills. There are three subtests that grade these skills: (1) word attack, which has students sound out gibberish words; (2) word identification, which analyzes a student’s verbal pronunciation while reading a passage; (3) spelling, which has students spell simple and complex words. The scores of these three tests will indicate how a student’s word recognition abilities compare to other students of the same age.\n\n(9). Oral Language comprehension encompasses oral vocabulary, morphology, sentence comprehension, and pragmatic language. There are three subtests that grade these skills: (1) listening comprehension, which tests a student’s ability to recall a verbal story; (2) reading comprehension, which tests a student’s ability to recall a written passage; (3) vocabulary, which tests the quantity of words that a student knows. The scores of these three tests indicate how a student’s oral language comprehension abilities compare to other students of the same age.\n\n(10). Consider Abby, a fourth-grade student who recently completed an SVR standardized reading comprehension assessment (Table 1). Abby can effectively recall details of stories read aloud, recall details from written passages, and is able to consistently use accurate vocabulary in speech. On the other hand, her reading is not fluent, her reading pace is slow, she frequently sounds out written words, and her spelling is below average. Her test results indicate weak word recognition skills and strong oral language comprehension skills (Table 1).\n\nTable 1: Abby’s test results\n\nPrimary Skill\n\nSubtest\n\nScore\n\nOral Language Comprehension\n\nListening Comprehension\n\n115\n\nReading Comprehension\n\n100\n\nVocabulary\n\n115\n\nWord Recognition\n\nWord Attack\n\n70\n\nWord Identification\n\n85\n\nSpelling\n\n72\n\n(11). Abby’s test scores, which indicate strong oral language comprehension skills and poor word recognition skills, is referred to as a first profile reading difficulty. Students under this profile may perform well in class discussions, but will have trouble on spelling and reading tests. In severe cases, this profile can indicate the presence of SLD/Dyslexia. A second profile reading disorder is classified by the opposite; strong word recognition skills and weak oral language comprehension. Students under this profile may perform well on spelling and reading tests, but will have difficulties expressing their ideas and comprehending verbal lectures. Finally, a third profile reading difficulty is indicated by a mix of strengths and weaknesses in both word recognition and oral language comprehension, with no clear discrepancy between the two.\n\n(12). Importantly, taking a standardized test is completely optional. Parents do not necessarily need their children to take any of these tests. However, the information received from the results of a child’s performance can provide information regarding their intellectual development and potential, which may identify the need for additional educational resources that target areas of weakness."

      "concept_text": "Table 1 indicates that Abby scored 100 on reading comprehension. To analyze this score, refer to paragraph 4 which discusses the bell curve distribution of test scores. Here, the author writes that a score of 100: “…marks the 50th percentile , as a score of 100 will be higher than 50% of the group.” Thus, Abby scored in the 50th percentile. This is also reinforced by looking at Figure 1 which shows that a score of 100 corresponds to the 50th percentile. The author explains that being in this percentile means that Abby’s score is higher than 50th percent of the group. 50% of the people that take this test will score below Abby while 50% will score higher. Abby is thus, in the middle. In other words, Abby scored an average score. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Below average – is incorrect because Table 1 shows that Abby scored 100 on the reading comprehension which “…marks the 50 th percentile, as a score of 100 will be higher than 50% of the group.” (Paragraph 4). Figure 1 also shows that Abby scored in the middle of the bell curve. This indicates that 50% of people will score higher and 50% will score lower than Abby. Thus, Abby’s score is not below average, rather it is at the average mark. Option C. Above average – is incorrect because Table 1 shows that Abby scored 100 on the reading comprehension which “…marks the 50 th percentile, as a score of 100 will be higher than 50% of the group.” (Paragraph 4). Figure 1 also shows that Abby scored in the middle of the bell curve. This indicates that 50% of people will score higher and 50% will score lower than Abby.

      "text": "(1). Alfred Binet was unlike other Psychologists at the beginning of the 20 th century. The primary focus of psychology at this time was understanding people who were different from the norm. This included why people felt, acted, or thought in unusual ways. Interestingly, Binet was interested in the very opposite of this notion. He wanted to define what was normal, specifically relating to mental capacity and intelligence. What defines an individual as highly intelligent, and where is the average?\n\n(2). Binet began to understand that many people were considered smart because they understood the laws of physics or could recite Shakespearean literature. He considered these skills as outcomes of higher education, which made him wonder if there was a way to measure intelligence regardless of education.\n\n(3). Binet proceeded to design a test to quantify the innate ability of a normal person. This would help French officials identify students who were in danger of falling behind in school. This innate ability was, and still is, referred to as an intelligence quotient, or IQ for short. Binet’s original test for children had them put things in order and identify patterns, to which education offered no advantage.\n\n(4). IQ is reported as a number on a scale, with 100 being the average for an individual’s age. Consider a 7-year-old boy who scores an IQ of 100 on Binet’s test. This boy is theoretically able to perform Binet’s tasks just as well as most other 7-year-olds. However, if he were to score a 110, he would be above average for his age. Mathematically, a large random sample of 7-year-old kids would have an average IQ score of 100. This marks the 50 th percentile, as a score of 100 will be higher than 50% of the group. 34% of the kids would have an IQ score between 85 and 100, and another 34% of the kids would score between 100 and 115. This means that 68% of the kids will score within 85 and 115. All the percentage ranges below an IQ score of 115 add up to 84%. This means that this score marks the 84 th percentile, as 84% of individuals will score below 115. This symmetrical standard distribution of test scores is commonly known as the bell curve (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Standard bell curve of IQ test scores\n\n(5). Theoretically, an individual’s IQ will stay the same throughout one’s life, as there are different tests for different ages. A 7-year-old will be scored against the average 7-year-old. When that same child is 10 years old, he will be scored against other 10-year-old children with more challenging questions, or more difficult grading schemes. The type of IQ test also plays an important role, as there are multiple tests currently available.\n\n(6). Lewis Terman of Stanford University developed the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test, which is an American adaptation of Binet’s original French test. Psychologist David Wechsler did not like either of these tests as they required a good grasp of language to do well. What if someone had a reading disability or poor linguistic education? The resulting IQ test is known as the Weschler Intelligence Scale, and consists of two parts. The first part is much like the Stanford-Binet test; it is called a verbal IQ score and is often close to a person’s Stanford-Binet IQ. The second part includes tasks that don’t require people to be good with words. For instance, identifying patterns in pictures is one of several wordless tasks. This part yields a performance IQ score, which may be extremely different from one’s verbal IQ score. Discrepancies in these two scores may help psychologists and teachers identify the presence of a language deficiency or reading disability. A third and final IQ score produced by the Wechsler scale is overall IQ, which averages the performance IQ and verbal IQ. Consistently, all IQ tests will exhibit a standard bell curve of scores within a random sample, with 100 always representing the average score.\n\n(7).

      "text": "(1). Alfred Binet was unlike other Psychologists at the beginning of the 20 th century. The primary focus of psychology at this time was understanding people who were different from the norm. This included why people felt, acted, or thought in unusual ways. Interestingly, Binet was interested in the very opposite of this notion. He wanted to define what was normal, specifically relating to mental capacity and intelligence. What defines an individual as highly intelligent, and where is the average?\n\n(2). Binet began to understand that many people were considered smart because they understood the laws of physics or could recite Shakespearean literature. He considered these skills as outcomes of higher education, which made him wonder if there was a way to measure intelligence regardless of education.\n\n(3). Binet proceeded to design a test to quantify the innate ability of a normal person. This would help French officials identify students who were in danger of falling behind in school. This innate ability was, and still is, referred to as an intelligence quotient, or IQ for short. Binet’s original test for children had them put things in order and identify patterns, to which education offered no advantage.\n\n(4). IQ is reported as a number on a scale, with 100 being the average for an individual’s age. Consider a 7-year-old boy who scores an IQ of 100 on Binet’s test. This boy is theoretically able to perform Binet’s tasks just as well as most other 7-year-olds. However, if he were to score a 110, he would be above average for his age. Mathematically, a large random sample of 7-year-old kids would have an average IQ score of 100. This marks the 50 th percentile, as a score of 100 will be higher than 50% of the group. 34% of the kids would have an IQ score between 85 and 100, and another 34% of the kids would score between 100 and 115. This means that 68% of the kids will score within 85 and 115. All the percentage ranges below an IQ score of 115 add up to 84%. This means that this score marks the 84 th percentile, as 84% of individuals will score below 115. This symmetrical standard distribution of test scores is commonly known as the bell curve (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Standard bell curve of IQ test scores\n\n(5). Theoretically, an individual’s IQ will stay the same throughout one’s life, as there are different tests for different ages. A 7-year-old will be scored against the average 7-year-old. When that same child is 10 years old, he will be scored against other 10-year-old children with more challenging questions, or more difficult grading schemes. The type of IQ test also plays an important role, as there are multiple tests currently available.\n\n(6). Lewis Terman of Stanford University developed the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test, which is an American adaptation of Binet’s original French test. Psychologist David Wechsler did not like either of these tests as they required a good grasp of language to do well. What if someone had a reading disability or poor linguistic education? The resulting IQ test is known as the Weschler Intelligence Scale, and consists of two parts. The first part is much like the Stanford-Binet test; it is called a verbal IQ score and is often close to a person’s Stanford-Binet IQ. The second part includes tasks that don’t require people to be good with words. For instance, identifying patterns in pictures is one of several wordless tasks. This part yields a performance IQ score, which may be extremely different from one’s verbal IQ score. Discrepancies in these two scores may help psychologists and teachers identify the presence of a language deficiency or reading disability. A third and final IQ score produced by the Wechsler scale is overall IQ, which averages the performance IQ and verbal IQ. Consistently, all IQ tests will exhibit a standard bell curve of scores within a random sample, with 100 always representing the average score.\n\n(7). Standardized reading comprehension assessments also score participants in a standard bell curve with an average of 100, but they do not indicate IQ. They merely indicate a global view of a child’s reading ability, which may provide useful instructions and interventions to improve reading capabilities. The Simple View of Reading (SVR) is a framework that identifies word recognition and oral language comprehension as the two primary components involved in reading comprehension. An SVR standardized reading comprehension assessment will thereby grade students on these two components.\n\n(8). Word recognition encompasses phonological awareness, automaticity of word recognition, and other phonic skills. There are three subtests that grade these skills: (1) word attack, which has students sound out gibberish words; (2) word identification, which analyzes a student’s verbal pronunciation while reading a passage; (3) spelling, which has students spell simple and complex words. The scores of these three tests will indicate how a student’s word recognition abilities compare to other students of the same age.\n\n(9). Oral Language comprehension encompasses oral vocabulary, morphology, sentence comprehension, and pragmatic language. There are three subtests that grade these skills: (1) listening comprehension, which tests a student’s ability to recall a verbal story; (2) reading comprehension, which tests a student’s ability to recall a written passage; (3) vocabulary, which tests the quantity of words that a student knows. The scores of these three tests indicate how a student’s oral language comprehension abilities compare to other students of the same age.\n\n(10). Consider Abby, a fourth-grade student who recently completed an SVR standardized reading comprehension assessment (Table 1). Abby can effectively recall details of stories read aloud, recall details from written passages, and is able to consistently use accurate vocabulary in speech. On the other hand, her reading is not fluent, her reading pace is slow, she frequently sounds out written words, and her spelling is below average. Her test results indicate weak word recognition skills and strong oral language comprehension skills (Table 1).\n\nTable 1: Abby’s test results\n\nPrimary Skill\n\nSubtest\n\nScore\n\nOral Language Comprehension\n\nListening Comprehension\n\n115\n\nReading Comprehension\n\n100\n\nVocabulary\n\n115\n\nWord Recognition\n\nWord Attack\n\n70\n\nWord Identification\n\n85\n\nSpelling\n\n72\n\n(11). Abby’s test scores, which indicate strong oral language comprehension skills and poor word recognition skills, is referred to as a first profile reading difficulty. Students under this profile may perform well in class discussions, but will have trouble on spelling and reading tests. In severe cases, this profile can indicate the presence of SLD/Dyslexia. A second profile reading disorder is classified by the opposite; strong word recognition skills and weak oral language comprehension. Students under this profile may perform well on spelling and reading tests, but will have difficulties expressing their ideas and comprehending verbal lectures. Finally, a third profile reading difficulty is indicated by a mix of strengths and weaknesses in both word recognition and oral language comprehension, with no clear discrepancy between the two.\n\n(12). Importantly, taking a standardized test is completely optional. Parents do not necessarily need their children to take any of these tests. However, the information received from the results of a child’s performance can provide information regarding their intellectual development and potential, which may identify the need for additional educational resources that target areas of weakness."

      "text": "(1). Alfred Binet was unlike other Psychologists at the beginning of the 20 th century. The primary focus of psychology at this time was understanding people who were different from the norm. This included why people felt, acted, or thought in unusual ways. Interestingly, Binet was interested in the very opposite of this notion. He wanted to define what was normal, specifically relating to mental capacity and intelligence. What defines an individual as highly intelligent, and where is the average?\n\n(2). Binet began to understand that many people were considered smart because they understood the laws of physics or could recite Shakespearean literature. He considered these skills as outcomes of higher education, which made him wonder if there was a way to measure intelligence regardless of education.\n\n(3). Binet proceeded to design a test to quantify the innate ability of a normal person. This would help French officials identify students who were in danger of falling behind in school. This innate ability was, and still is, referred to as an intelligence quotient, or IQ for short. Binet’s original test for children had them put things in order and identify patterns, to which education offered no advantage.\n\n(4). IQ is reported as a number on a scale, with 100 being the average for an individual’s age. Consider a 7-year-old boy who scores an IQ of 100 on Binet’s test. This boy is theoretically able to perform Binet’s tasks just as well as most other 7-year-olds. However, if he were to score a 110, he would be above average for his age. Mathematically, a large random sample of 7-year-old kids would have an average IQ score of 100. This marks the 50 th percentile, as a score of 100 will be higher than 50% of the group. 34% of the kids would have an IQ score between 85 and 100, and another 34% of the kids would score between 100 and 115. This means that 68% of the kids will score within 85 and 115. All the percentage ranges below an IQ score of 115 add up to 84%. This means that this score marks the 84 th percentile, as 84% of individuals will score below 115. This symmetrical standard distribution of test scores is commonly known as the bell curve (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Standard bell curve of IQ test scores\n\n(5). Theoretically, an individual’s IQ will stay the same throughout one’s life, as there are different tests for different ages. A 7-year-old will be scored against the average 7-year-old. When that same child is 10 years old, he will be scored against other 10-year-old children with more challenging questions, or more difficult grading schemes. The type of IQ test also plays an important role, as there are multiple tests currently available.\n\n(6). Lewis Terman of Stanford University developed the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test, which is an American adaptation of Binet’s original French test. Psychologist David Wechsler did not like either of these tests as they required a good grasp of language to do well. What if someone had a reading disability or poor linguistic education? The resulting IQ test is known as the Weschler Intelligence Scale, and consists of two parts. The first part is much like the Stanford-Binet test; it is called a verbal IQ score and is often close to a person’s Stanford-Binet IQ. The second part includes tasks that don’t require people to be good with words. For instance, identifying patterns in pictures is one of several wordless tasks. This part yields a performance IQ score, which may be extremely different from one’s verbal IQ score. Discrepancies in these two scores may help psychologists and teachers identify the presence of a language deficiency or reading disability. A third and final IQ score produced by the Wechsler scale is overall IQ, which averages the performance IQ and verbal IQ. Consistently, all IQ tests will exhibit a standard bell curve of scores within a random sample, with 100 always representing the average score.\n\n(7). Standardized reading comprehension assessments also score participants in a standard bell curve with an average of 100, but they do not indicate IQ. They merely indicate a global view of a child’s reading ability, which may provide useful instructions and interventions to improve reading capabilities. The Simple View of Reading (SVR) is a framework that identifies word recognition and oral language comprehension as the two primary components involved in reading comprehension. An SVR standardized reading comprehension assessment will thereby grade students on these two components.\n\n(8). Word recognition encompasses phonological awareness, automaticity of word recognition, and other phonic skills. There are three subtests that grade these skills: (1) word attack, which has students sound out gibberish words; (2) word identification, which analyzes a student’s verbal pronunciation while reading a passage; (3) spelling, which has students spell simple and complex words. The scores of these three tests will indicate how a student’s word recognition abilities compare to other students of the same age.\n\n(9). Oral Language comprehension encompasses oral vocabulary, morphology, sentence comprehension, and pragmatic language.

This means that this score marks the 84 th percentile, as 84% of individuals will score below 115. This symmetrical standard distribution of test scores is commonly known as the bell curve (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Standard bell curve of IQ test scores\n\n(5). Theoretically, an individual’s IQ will stay the same throughout one’s life, as there are different tests for different ages. A 7-year-old will be scored against the average 7-year-old. When that same child is 10 years old, he will be scored against other 10-year-old children with more challenging questions, or more difficult grading schemes. The type of IQ test also plays an important role, as there are multiple tests currently available.\n\n(6). Lewis Terman of Stanford University developed the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test, which is an American adaptation of Binet’s original French test. Psychologist David Wechsler did not like either of these tests as they required a good grasp of language to do well. What if someone had a reading disability or poor linguistic education? The resulting IQ test is known as the Weschler Intelligence Scale, and consists of two parts. The first part is much like the Stanford-Binet test; it is called a verbal IQ score and is often close to a person’s Stanford-Binet IQ. The second part includes tasks that don’t require people to be good with words. For instance, identifying patterns in pictures is one of several wordless tasks. This part yields a performance IQ score, which may be extremely different from one’s verbal IQ score. Discrepancies in these two scores may help psychologists and teachers identify the presence of a language deficiency or reading disability. A third and final IQ score produced by the Wechsler scale is overall IQ, which averages the performance IQ and verbal IQ. Consistently, all IQ tests will exhibit a standard bell curve of scores within a random sample, with 100 always representing the average score.\n\n(7). Standardized reading comprehension assessments also score participants in a standard bell curve with an average of 100, but they do not indicate IQ. They merely indicate a global view of a child’s reading ability, which may provide useful instructions and interventions to improve reading capabilities. The Simple View of Reading (SVR) is a framework that identifies word recognition and oral language comprehension as the two primary components involved in reading comprehension. An SVR standardized reading comprehension assessment will thereby grade students on these two components.\n\n(8). Word recognition encompasses phonological awareness, automaticity of word recognition, and other phonic skills. There are three subtests that grade these skills: (1) word attack, which has students sound out gibberish words; (2) word identification, which analyzes a student’s verbal pronunciation while reading a passage; (3) spelling, which has students spell simple and complex words. The scores of these three tests will indicate how a student’s word recognition abilities compare to other students of the same age.\n\n(9). Oral Language comprehension encompasses oral vocabulary, morphology, sentence comprehension, and pragmatic language. There are three subtests that grade these skills: (1) listening comprehension, which tests a student’s ability to recall a verbal story; (2) reading comprehension, which tests a student’s ability to recall a written passage; (3) vocabulary, which tests the quantity of words that a student knows. The scores of these three tests indicate how a student’s oral language comprehension abilities compare to other students of the same age.\n\n(10). Consider Abby, a fourth-grade student who recently completed an SVR standardized reading comprehension assessment (Table 1). Abby can effectively recall details of stories read aloud, recall details from written passages, and is able to consistently use accurate vocabulary in speech. On the other hand, her reading is not fluent, her reading pace is slow, she frequently sounds out written words, and her spelling is below average.

      "text": "(1). Alfred Binet was unlike other Psychologists at the beginning of the 20 th century. The primary focus of psychology at this time was understanding people who were different from the norm. This included why people felt, acted, or thought in unusual ways. Interestingly, Binet was interested in the very opposite of this notion. He wanted to define what was normal, specifically relating to mental capacity and intelligence. What defines an individual as highly intelligent, and where is the average?\n\n(2). Binet began to understand that many people were considered smart because they understood the laws of physics or could recite Shakespearean literature. He considered these skills as outcomes of higher education, which made him wonder if there was a way to measure intelligence regardless of education.\n\n(3). Binet proceeded to design a test to quantify the innate ability of a normal person. This would help French officials identify students who were in danger of falling behind in school. This innate ability was, and still is, referred to as an intelligence quotient, or IQ for short. Binet’s original test for children had them put things in order and identify patterns, to which education offered no advantage.\n\n(4). IQ is reported as a number on a scale, with 100 being the average for an individual’s age. Consider a 7-year-old boy who scores an IQ of 100 on Binet’s test. This boy is theoretically able to perform Binet’s tasks just as well as most other 7-year-olds. However, if he were to score a 110, he would be above average for his age. Mathematically, a large random sample of 7-year-old kids would have an average IQ score of 100. This marks the 50 th percentile, as a score of 100 will be higher than 50% of the group. 34% of the kids would have an IQ score between 85 and 100, and another 34% of the kids would score between 100 and 115.

The passage then addresses the other forms of intelligence testing and provides an example in paragraphs 6 to 10, and concludes with a brief discussion on profile reading difficulties (paragraph 11). Evidently, the passage focuses on describing standardized testing. To accomplish this, the author employs an informative tone. They do not appear to take any specific side of an argument nor do they seem to advocate strongly for a position. Rather, they are merely stating facts and explaining concepts in depth. Hence, the author’s tone is informative. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Indifferent – is incorrect because indifference is being unconcerned. Although the overall neutral tone of the passage may suggest that the author does not care too strongly about this topic, there is no indication that the author is unconcerned.

The primary focus of psychology at this time was understanding people who were different from the norm. […] Interestingly, Binet was interested in the very opposite of this notion. He wanted to define what was normal, specifically relating to mental capacity and intelligence. What defines an individual as highly intelligent, and where is the average?” By using rhetorical questions and words such as “interestingly”, the author appears to be somewhat intrigued by the topic. On the other hand, claiming that they are indifferent is too strong of an assumption because there is no passage evidence to suggest this. Option B. Pessimistic – is incorrect because pessimism is the tendency to view something in a negative, foreboding light. The author does not appear to be pessimistic about standardized testing. On the contrary, paragraph 12 states that “However, the information received from the results of a child’s performance can provide information regarding their intellectual development and potential, which may identify the need for additional educational resources that target areas of weakness.” By claiming that these assessments can have potential benefits, the author discusses standardized testing and its effects in a positive and optimistic light. Thus, the author does NOT employ a negative, pessimistic tone. Option D. Speculative – is incorrect because a speculative tone involves demonstrating doubt about the subject manner. However, the author does not appear to this at all. Although the author does explain the limitations of traditional IQ testing in paragraph 6, they reconcile this by discussing other forms of tests. Thus, the author does NOT employ a speculative tone. Option E. Hypothetical – is incorrect because a hypothetical tone would involve having some degree of uncertainty. However, the author states the information in the passage as matters of facts. There is no doubt about the subject manner. Although the author does explain the limitations of traditional IQ testing in paragraph 6, they reconcile this by discussing other forms of tests. Thus, the author does NOT employ a hypothetical tone.",

This boy is theoretically able to perform Binet’s tasks just as well as most other 7-year-olds. However, if he were to score a 110, he would be above average for his age. Mathematically, a large random sample of 7-year-old kids would have an average IQ score of 100. This marks the 50 th percentile, as a score of 100 will be higher than 50% of the group. 34% of the kids would have an IQ score between 85 and 100, and another 34% of the kids would score between 100 and 115. This means that 68% of the kids will score within 85 and 115. All the percentage ranges below an IQ score of 115 add up to 84%. This means that this score marks the 84 th percentile, as 84% of individuals will score below 115. This symmetrical standard distribution of test scores is commonly known as the bell curve (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Standard bell curve of IQ test scores\n\n(5). Theoretically, an individual’s IQ will stay the same throughout one’s life, as there are different tests for different ages. A 7-year-old will be scored against the average 7-year-old. When that same child is 10 years old, he will be scored against other 10-year-old children with more challenging questions, or more difficult grading schemes. The type of IQ test also plays an important role, as there are multiple tests currently available.\n\n(6). Lewis Terman of Stanford University developed the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test, which is an American adaptation of Binet’s original French test. Psychologist David Wechsler did not like either of these tests as they required a good grasp of language to do well. What if someone had a reading disability or poor linguistic education? The resulting IQ test is known as the Weschler Intelligence Scale, and consists of two parts.

Discrepancies in these two scores may help psychologists and teachers identify the presence of a language deficiency or reading disability. A third and final IQ score produced by the Wechsler scale is overall IQ, which averages the performance IQ and verbal IQ.

On the other hand, her reading is not fluent, her reading pace is slow, she frequently sounds out written words, and her spelling is below average.

Abby’s test scores, which indicate strong oral language comprehension skills and poor word recognition skills, is referred to as a first profile reading difficulty. Students under this profile may perform well in class discussions, but will have trouble on spelling and reading tests. In severe cases, this profile can indicate the presence of SLD/Dyslexia. A second profile reading disorder is classified by the opposite; strong word recognition skills and weak oral language comprehension. Students under this profile may perform well on spelling and reading tests, but will have difficulties expressing their ideas and comprehending verbal lectures. Finally, a third profile reading difficulty is indicated by a mix of strengths and weaknesses in both word recognition and oral language comprehension, with no clear discrepancy between the two.\n\n(12). Importantly, taking a standardized test is completely optional. Parents do not necessarily need their children to take any of these tests. However, the information received from the results of a child’s performance can provide information regarding their intellectual development and potential, which may identify the need for additional educational resources that target areas of weakness."

On the other hand, her reading is not fluent, her reading pace is slow, she frequently sounds out written words, and her spelling is below average. Her test results indicate weak word recognition skills and strong oral language comprehension skills (Table 1).\n\nTable 1: Abby’s test results\n\nPrimary Skill\n\nSubtest\n\nScore\n\nOral Language Comprehension\n\nListening Comprehension\n\n115\n\nReading Comprehension\n\n100\n\nVocabulary\n\n115\n\nWord Recognition\n\nWord Attack\n\n70\n\nWord Identification\n\n85\n\nSpelling\n\n72\n\n(11). Abby’s test scores, which indicate strong oral language comprehension skills and poor word recognition skills, is referred to as a first profile reading difficulty. Students under this profile may perform well in class discussions, but will have trouble on spelling and reading tests. In severe cases, this profile can indicate the presence of SLD/Dyslexia. A second profile reading disorder is classified by the opposite; strong word recognition skills and weak oral language comprehension. Students under this profile may perform well on spelling and reading tests, but will have difficulties expressing their ideas and comprehending verbal lectures. Finally, a third profile reading difficulty is indicated by a mix of strengths and weaknesses in both word recognition and oral language comprehension, with no clear discrepancy between the two.\n\n(12). Importantly, taking a standardized test is completely optional. Parents do not necessarily need their children to take any of these tests. However, the information received from the results of a child’s performance can provide information regarding their intellectual development and potential, which may identify the need for additional educational resources that target areas of weakness."

    "explanation": {
      "concept_text": "Paragraph 3 states: “Binet proceeded to design a test to quantify the innate ability of a normal person. This would help French officials identify students who were in danger of falling behind in school. This innate ability was, and still is, referred to as an intelligence quotient, or IQ for short.” Thus, a benefit of IQ tests is that it allows for the identification of students who are at risk of falling behind in school. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. It allows students who have above-average abilities to be recognized – is incorrect because paragraph 3 states that IQ tests “…would help French officials identify students who were in danger of falling behind in school.” Although identifying students who have extraordinary abilities is possible through this test, it is not mentioned in the passage as a benefit of IQ testing. Rather, the author states that this test allows for the identification of students who are at risk of falling behind in school. Option C. It has enhanced assessment systems in schools – is incorrect because the passage never discusses a school’s grading system. Thus, it is unclear how IQ testing would have improved the grading system in schools. Rather, the author mentions that a benefit of IQ testing is that it “…would help French officials identify students who were in danger of falling behind in school.” (Paragraph 3). Option D. It aided the French military in ranking their officers – is incorrect because the passage never discusses the French military ranking system. Thus, it is unclear how IQ testing would have improved helped the French military rank their officers. Rather, the author mentions that a benefit of IQ testing is that it “…would help French officials identify students who were in danger of falling behind in school.” (Paragraph 3). Option E. It contributed to French literature in Psychology – is incorrect because although Alfred Binet was a psychologist, the passage never discusses how developing IQ tests contributed to French literature in Psychology. Thus, it is unclear how this would be a benefit of IQ testing. Rather, the author mentions that a benefit of IQ testing is that it “…would help French officials identify students who were in danger of falling behind in school.” (Paragraph 3).",
