      "text": "(1). Approximately 40 to 50 million people died during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, all due to a parasite that is one-millionth of an inch long. As a ubiquitous part of our environment, this organism can only be seen with the aid of an electron microscope, yet it can wreak havoc on the cells of all living organisms. This parasite is called a virus.\n\n(2). A virion is a virus particle that consists of genetic instructions wrapped in a coat of protein. Their genes consist of either DNA or RNA that is protected by a coat of protein. This coat protects their genetic information and aids in detecting the appropriate host cells to invade. Some viruses are surrounded by a lipid membrane, and some are not. The former is called an enveloped virus, and the latter is called a naked virus. These parasites do not have enzymes to carry out their chemical reactions and are entirely dependent on a host to make copies of themselves. Hosts include plants, bacteria, archaea, and animals. Because they don’t have the biochemical machinery to carry out their functions, they also have the advantage of laying dormant for years as they wait for a host cell to aid them in reproduction.\n\n(3). There are two ways for a virus to reproduce. The first one, used by the common cold and flu viruses, is called the lytic cycle. As soon as the virus enters the host organism, the protein on the virus coat detects the appropriate host cell to invade. It then inserts itself into the wall of the host cell and releases its genetic material inside. This injected genetic material then utilizes the host’s metabolic processes and recruits the enzymes of the host cell to begin making new DNA or RNA strands along with new proteins for the outer wall. As soon as this is complete, the new particles assemble. They then break free either by lysis, which refers to the destruction of the cell or by budding, in which the new virions pinch out of the cell membrane and then carry a piece of the existing membrane with them. Now that there are more virions, they can spread and continue through a new lytic cycle.\\\n\n(4). As the virions multiply and spread, the body’s immune response is often triggered and produces pyrogens. This response causes the body’s temperature to rise to induce a fever, which, in turn, causes metabolic processes in the body to slow down. Normally the human body functions most efficiently at 37°C. A higher temperature causes the processes to slow down, slowing the metabolism of the host cells and the multiplication of the virions within the host cells.\n\n(5). The other cycle of multiplication is called the lysogenic cycle. This cycle is utilized by viruses that cause herpes and HIV. At the beginning of this cycle, the viruses invade the host’s cells, but they do not multiply. Instead, they mix their genes with the genes of the host so that when the host cell reproduces, the virus’s genetics are copied into the host cell’s offspring. They then often lie dormant until some environmental or genetic event triggers them, causing them to enter the lytic cycle and spread. Therefore, patients with HIV tend not to show symptoms of illness for years after contracting the virus, although the host is still contagious during this time. Perhaps the most infamous exemplification of this process occurred when Magic Johnson, a global icon at the time, announced his HIV-positive status in 1991. The news shocked the sports world and brought powerful awareness overnight.\n\n(6). Johnson’s choice to go public with his HIV diagnosis was impactful for numerous reasons. In 1991, when Johnson made his announcement, those with HIV were often at the center of condemnation. It was a disease that much of the public believed was limited to marginalized communities and was also thought of as leading to a certain death since there existed no cure for the illness at the time. Johnson, being a high-profile celebrity and beloved sports figure, effectively challenged many people’s notions of HIV in terms of who it can impact. The athlete’s announcement humanized the disease in the eyes of many, leading to discussions surrounding prevention, testing, and treatment becoming much more commonplace. Johnson received significant praise for his decision to publicly announce his diagnosis and continues to advocate for reduced stigma of HIV, demonstrating that it is possible to live a full and healthy life as an HIV-positive individual.\n\n(7). Viruses spread through many different means. They can use a carrier organism such as a mosquito or a fly to invade their next host, or they can travel through the air; or can transfer through direct contact of bodily fluids including blood, saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, sweat, or nasal discharge.\n\n(8). Even though viruses cannot carry out their life cycle without a host, they are still susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures that affect other organisms precisely because they rely on other living organisms. If they are to successfully multiply and spread to new hosts, they must carry genes that allow this to happen. If they house genes that do not allow them to multiply effectively, perhaps killing the host within a few hours, those specific genes will disappear forever. On the other hand, if the viruses’ genes are very successful at keeping the host alive and causing the host to spread its viral offspring, this virus will be successful.\n\n(9). As part of the evolutionary arms race, host bodies busily create antibodies that can detect known viruses and lock them into their outer protein surface, thus preventing them from entering the host’s cells. When a mutation in the protein of the virion occurs, it becomes unrecognizable to the host’s antibodies, and the virus is suddenly successful. It will again be able to quickly multiply while the host’s body is busy trying to recognize the new virus and create the appropriate antibodies.\n\n(10). Viruses can make millions of copies of themselves in seconds, which means that their mutation rate is much higher than in an organism that reproduces much more slowly. However, there is a difference in mutation rates between RNA virions and DNA virions. Viruses with DNA are more stable due to a proofreading check, which they have as part of their reproduction process. These virions use the host cell to check their DNA replication. If there is a mistake in the reproductive process, the host cell is often able to correct it. Therefore, viruses containing DNA do not mutate as frequently as RNA viruses. Two known RNA viruses include the influenza virus and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. As a result, these two viruses are of particular interest to scientists.\n\n(11). When a person receives a vaccination, a small amount of virus is injected into their body, allowing the person’s immune system to create antibodies before they are exposed to the virus from the natural environment. Once they are exposed to the virus, the pre-existing antibodies will be able to quickly recognize and protect the person against the known virus before it can invade. However, RNA viruses such as the influenza virus, which causes the flu, have a high rate of mutation, which means that each year scientists must predict likely mutations in the flu virus to develop an effective vaccination.\n\n(12). There are three types of influenza virus: A, B, and C. Type A influenza virus could infect an array of organisms including humans, pigs, dogs, horses, and birds. Along with the fact that it is an RNA virus, this wide range of hosts means that it has more possibility for mutations. Mutations in influenza virus A are limited to the virus’ surface proteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. You may have heard of the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009. The name H1N1 refers to mutations in these two proteins. In contrast, influenza virus types B and C are not able to infect other species, and therefore their mutation rate is much slower.\n\n(13). There are two ways in which these proteins can mutate. The first is by antigenic drift, which refers to mutations in the genetic code as a virus reproduces within a cell. The genetic code of an ancestral virus drifts as it accumulates mutations in its proteins. When scientists develop flu shots, they aim to predict the accumulation of mutations in the coming flu season. Sometimes scientists can predict with some accuracy, and other times they may miss altogether.\n\n(14). The second is by antigenic shift, which refers to the process where two types of virions enter a host cell and then recombine, creating a new and very different strain of the virus. Because this strain is so dissimilar from either parent virus, it is difficult for the host’s immune system to detect. If this new virus is successful at reproducing and spreading, it could lead to a pandemic.\n\n(15). Because influenza A can infect different species, it has more opportunities to mutate or recombine and create new strains of the virus. If the pig flu and the human flu enter the same host cell in a bird, they may recombine and create a dramatically different type of influenza strain. If this new strain mutates and spreads in a given organism, it has devastating potential. In 2003, the H5N1 strain, or bird flu, scared many people in that it was drastically different from previous strains. Had it been successful at spreading, it would not have been recognized by human immune systems. However, this strain did not spread easily among humans and thus, did not turn into a pandemic.\n\n(16). Human infections of bird flu, or 'avian influenza,' are uncommon. When infections do occur, they usually result from close contact with infected birds, often in highly contaminated areas like chicken farms or wet markets. Symptoms of bird flu in humans can vary widely, including fever, eye irritation, upper respiratory issues like sore throat and cough, as well as headaches, muscle aches, and, in some cases, seizures. Symptoms typically appear around three to five days after the initial infection. Although such an outcome is very rare, bird flu can sometimes be fatal in humans should it lead to pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, or organ failure. It is difficult to ascertain when or if a bird flu would lead to an actual pandemic within the human population. Scientists can only keep track of the disease and research how it spreads and progresses over time.\n\n(17). Another RNA virus with unique properties is HIV. It is capable of producing copies quicker than other viruses, sometimes making more than a billion copies in a day. Because of its quick multiplication, mutations occur frequently; and because of the prevalence of mutations, two different types of the virus may be present in the same host cell and recombine, forming a dramatically different strain. The challenge is and has been for some time, the development of a productive vaccine."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, note that the phrase “evolutionary arms race” is referenced using quotation marks. This means that the phrase will be found directly in the passage. Indeed, paragraph 8 includes this phrase. It reads: “As part of the evolutionary arms race …a mutation in the protein of the virion occurs, it becomes unrecognizable to the host’s antibodies, and the virus is suddenly successful. It will again be able to quickly multiply while the host’s body is busy trying to recognize the new virus and create the appropriate antibodies.” This tells us that viruses can reproduce rapidly, which increases the likelihood that they will mutate and become unrecognizable to human immune systems, thus allowing them to stay ahead in the evolutionary arms race. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Viruses can lie and wait for years outside of a host – is incorrect because, while this may seem correct, a virus’s ability to lie and wait is not what makes it successful evolutionarily; it is what helps it to survive until it is ready to reproduce, as written in paragraph 2: “As  … viruses don’t have the biochemical machinery to carry out their own functions, they have the advantage of being able to lie dormant for years, waiting on a host cell to aid in their reproduction.” Option C. Viruses cause the immune system to be triggered during an infection – is incorrect because, based on the passage, triggering a host’s immune system is an unwanted outcome for a virus, since it increases the likelihood that the virus will be eliminated, thus making it unsuccessful evolutionarily. For example, when discussing bird flu in paragraph 14, the author states: “Had it been successful at spreading, it would not have been recognized by human immune systems.” Option D. Viruses can remain dormant within a host for years – is incorrect because, while this may seem correct, a virus’s ability to lay dormant and wait is not what makes it successful evolutionarily; it is only what helps it survive until it is ready to reproduce, as stated in paragraph 2: “Because they don’t have the biochemical machinery to carry out their functions, they also have the advantage of laying dormant for years as they wait for a host cell to aid them in reproduction.” Option E. Viruses adapt to environmental changes by relying on host mechanisms – is incorrect because, while this may seem correct, the author states in paragraph 8: “When a mutation in the protein of the virion occurs, it becomes unrecognizable to the host’s antibodies, and the virus is suddenly successful. It will again be able to quickly multiply while the host’s body is busy trying to recognize the new virus and create the appropriate antibodies.” This does not mention that viruses directly use host mechanisms to adapt to the environment; thus, this cannot be what helps them evolutionarily.",

Therefore, patients with HIV tend not to show symptoms of illness for years after contracting the virus, although the host is still contagious during this time. Perhaps the most infamous exemplification of this process occurred when Magic Johnson, a global icon at the time, announced his HIV-positive status in 1991. The news shocked the sports world and brought powerful awareness overnight.\n\n(6). Johnson’s choice to go public with his HIV diagnosis was impactful for numerous reasons. In 1991, when Johnson made his announcement, those with HIV were often at the center of condemnation. It was a disease that much of the public believed was limited to marginalized communities and was also thought of as leading to a certain death since there existed no cure for the illness at the time. Johnson, being a high-profile celebrity and beloved sports figure, effectively challenged many people’s notions of HIV in terms of who it can impact. The athlete’s announcement humanized the disease in the eyes of many, leading to discussions surrounding prevention, testing, and treatment becoming much more commonplace. Johnson received significant praise for his decision to publicly announce his diagnosis and continues to advocate for reduced stigma of HIV, demonstrating that it is possible to live a full and healthy life as an HIV-positive individual.\n\n(7). Viruses spread through many different means. They can use a carrier organism such as a mosquito or a fly to invade their next host, or they can travel through the air; or can transfer through direct contact of bodily fluids including blood, saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, sweat, or nasal discharge.\n\n(8). Even though viruses cannot carry out their life cycle without a host, they are still susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures that affect other organisms precisely because they rely on other living organisms. If they are to successfully multiply and spread to new hosts, they must carry genes that allow this to happen. If they house genes that do not allow them to multiply effectively, perhaps killing the host within a few hours, those specific genes will disappear forever. On the other hand, if the viruses’ genes are very successful at keeping the host alive and causing the host to spread its viral offspring, this virus will be successful.\n\n(9). As part of the evolutionary arms race, host bodies busily create antibodies that can detect known viruses and lock them into their outer protein surface, thus preventing them from entering the host’s cells. When a mutation in the protein of the virion occurs, it becomes unrecognizable to the host’s antibodies, and the virus is suddenly successful. It will again be able to quickly multiply while the host’s body is busy trying to recognize the new virus and create the appropriate antibodies.\n\n(10). Viruses can make millions of copies of themselves in seconds, which means that their mutation rate is much higher than in an organism that reproduces much more slowly. However, there is a difference in mutation rates between RNA virions and DNA virions. Viruses with DNA are more stable due to a proofreading check, which they have as part of their reproduction process. These virions use the host cell to check their DNA replication. If there is a mistake in the reproductive process, the host cell is often able to correct it. Therefore, viruses containing DNA do not mutate as frequently as RNA viruses. Two known RNA viruses include the influenza virus and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. As a result, these two viruses are of particular interest to scientists.\n\n(11). When a person receives a vaccination, a small amount of virus is injected into their body, allowing the person’s immune system to create antibodies before they are exposed to the virus from the natural environment. Once they are exposed to the virus, the pre-existing antibodies will be able to quickly recognize and protect the person against the known virus before it can invade. However, RNA viruses such as the influenza virus, which causes the flu, have a high rate of mutation, which means that each year scientists must predict likely mutations in the flu virus to develop an effective vaccination.\n\n(12). There are three types of influenza virus: A, B, and C. Type A influenza virus could infect an array of organisms including humans, pigs, dogs, horses, and birds. Along with the fact that it is an RNA virus, this wide range of hosts means that it has more possibility for mutations. Mutations in influenza virus A are limited to the virus’ surface proteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. You may have heard of the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009. The name H1N1 refers to mutations in these two proteins. In contrast, influenza virus types B and C are not able to infect other species, and therefore their mutation rate is much slower.\n\n(13). There are two ways in which these proteins can mutate. The first is by antigenic drift, which refers to mutations in the genetic code as a virus reproduces within a cell. The genetic code of an ancestral virus drifts as it accumulates mutations in its proteins. When scientists develop flu shots, they aim to predict the accumulation of mutations in the coming flu season. Sometimes scientists can predict with some accuracy, and other times they may miss altogether.\n\n(14). The second is by antigenic shift, which refers to the process where two types of virions enter a host cell and then recombine, creating a new and very different strain of the virus. Because this strain is so dissimilar from either parent virus, it is difficult for the host’s immune system to detect. If this new virus is successful at reproducing and spreading, it could lead to a pandemic.\n\n(15). Because influenza A can infect different species, it has more opportunities to mutate or recombine and create new strains of the virus. If the pig flu and the human flu enter the same host cell in a bird, they may recombine and create a dramatically different type of influenza strain. If this new strain mutates and spreads in a given organism, it has devastating potential. In 2003, the H5N1 strain, or bird flu, scared many people in that it was drastically different from previous strains. Had it been successful at spreading, it would not have been recognized by human immune systems. However, this strain did not spread easily among humans and thus, did not turn into a pandemic.\n\n(16). Human infections of bird flu, or 'avian influenza,' are uncommon. When infections do occur, they usually result from close contact with infected birds, often in highly contaminated areas like chicken farms or wet markets. Symptoms of bird flu in humans can vary widely, including fever, eye irritation, upper respiratory issues like sore throat and cough, as well as headaches, muscle aches, and, in some cases, seizures. Symptoms typically appear around three to five days after the initial infection. Although such an outcome is very rare, bird flu can sometimes be fatal in humans should it lead to pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, or organ failure. It is difficult to ascertain when or if a bird flu would lead to an actual pandemic within the human population. Scientists can only keep track of the disease and research how it spreads and progresses over time.\n\n(17). Another RNA virus with unique properties is HIV. It is capable of producing copies quicker than other viruses, sometimes making more than a billion copies in a day. Because of its quick multiplication, mutations occur frequently; and because of the prevalence of mutations, two different types of the virus may be present in the same host cell and recombine, forming a dramatically different strain. The challenge is and has been for some time, the development of a productive vaccine."

Vaccines are discussed in paragraphs 10, 11, and 12, and again briefly in paragraph 15; from here, we should scan each of these passages for the one which discusses the influenza vaccine. This is paragraph 12: “There are two ways in which hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins can mutate.

It is difficult for scientists to obtain vaccine test subjects – is incorrect because the passage does not mention the challenge of obtaining test subjects for the influenza vaccine. Option C.

The Influenza virus can jump between species unexpectedly – is incorrect because this is true of influenza A mentioned in paragraph 14, but not all flu viruses. Additionally, paragraph 12 does not cite it as being a reason that vaccine production is challenging. Option E. The influenza virus has the capacity to spread quickly – is incorrect because, while this is true of viruses in general, the author states in paragraph 12, “If viruses are to successfully multiply and spread to new hosts, they must carry genes that allow this to happen.” Scientists’ ability to manufacture vaccines is not mentioned; thus, this is incorrect.",

      "text": "(1). Approximately 40 to 50 million people died during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, all due to a parasite that is one-millionth of an inch long. As a ubiquitous part of our environment, this organism can only be seen with the aid of an electron microscope, yet it can wreak havoc on the cells of all living organisms. This parasite is called a virus.\n\n(2). A virion is a virus particle that consists of genetic instructions wrapped in a coat of protein. Their genes consist of either DNA or RNA that is protected by a coat of protein. This coat protects their genetic information and aids in detecting the appropriate host cells to invade. Some viruses are surrounded by a lipid membrane, and some are not. The former is called an enveloped virus, and the latter is called a naked virus. These parasites do not have enzymes to carry out their chemical reactions and are entirely dependent on a host to make copies of themselves. Hosts include plants, bacteria, archaea, and animals. Because they don’t have the biochemical machinery to carry out their functions, they also have the advantage of laying dormant for years as they wait for a host cell to aid them in reproduction.\n\n(3). There are two ways for a virus to reproduce. The first one, used by the common cold and flu viruses, is called the lytic cycle. As soon as the virus enters the host organism, the protein on the virus coat detects the appropriate host cell to invade. It then inserts itself into the wall of the host cell and releases its genetic material inside. This injected genetic material then utilizes the host’s metabolic processes and recruits the enzymes of the host cell to begin making new DNA or RNA strands along with new proteins for the outer wall. As soon as this is complete, the new particles assemble. They then break free either by lysis, which refers to the destruction of the cell or by budding, in which the new virions pinch out of the cell membrane and then carry a piece of the existing membrane with them. Now that there are more virions, they can spread and continue through a new lytic cycle.\\\n\n(4). As the virions multiply and spread, the body’s immune response is often triggered and produces pyrogens. This response causes the body’s temperature to rise to induce a fever, which, in turn, causes metabolic processes in the body to slow down. Normally the human body functions most efficiently at 37°C. A higher temperature causes the processes to slow down, slowing the metabolism of the host cells and the multiplication of the virions within the host cells.\n\n(5). The other cycle of multiplication is called the lysogenic cycle. This cycle is utilized by viruses that cause herpes and HIV. At the beginning of this cycle, the viruses invade the host’s cells, but they do not multiply. Instead, they mix their genes with the genes of the host so that when the host cell reproduces, the virus’s genetics are copied into the host cell’s offspring. They then often lie dormant until some environmental or genetic event triggers them, causing them to enter the lytic cycle and spread.

There are two ways in which these proteins can mutate. The first is by antigenic drift, which refers to mutations in the genetic code as a virus reproduces within a cell. The genetic code of an ancestral virus drifts as it accumulates mutations in its proteins. When scientists develop flu shots, they aim to predict the accumulation of mutations in the coming flu season. Sometimes scientists can predict with some accuracy, and other times they may miss altogether.\n\n(14). The second is by antigenic shift, which refers to the process where two types of virions enter a host cell and then recombine, creating a new and very different strain of the virus. Because this strain is so dissimilar from either parent virus, it is difficult for the host’s immune system to detect. If this new virus is successful at reproducing and spreading, it could lead to a pandemic.\n\n(15). Because influenza A can infect different species, it has more opportunities to mutate or recombine and create new strains of the virus. If the pig flu and the human flu enter the same host cell in a bird, they may recombine and create a dramatically different type of influenza strain. If this new strain mutates and spreads in a given organism, it has devastating potential. In 2003, the H5N1 strain, or bird flu, scared many people in that it was drastically different from previous strains. Had it been successful at spreading, it would not have been recognized by human immune systems. However, this strain did not spread easily among humans and thus, did not turn into a pandemic.\n\n(16). Human infections of bird flu, or 'avian influenza,' are uncommon. When infections do occur, they usually result from close contact with infected birds, often in highly contaminated areas like chicken farms or wet markets. Symptoms of bird flu in humans can vary widely, including fever, eye irritation, upper respiratory issues like sore throat and cough, as well as headaches, muscle aches, and, in some cases, seizures. Symptoms typically appear around three to five days after the initial infection. Although such an outcome is very rare, bird flu can sometimes be fatal in humans should it lead to pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, or organ failure. It is difficult to ascertain when or if a bird flu would lead to an actual pandemic within the human population. Scientists can only keep track of the disease and research how it spreads and progresses over time.\n\n(17). Another RNA virus with unique properties is HIV. It is capable of producing copies quicker than other viruses, sometimes making more than a billion copies in a day. Because of its quick multiplication, mutations occur frequently; and because of the prevalence of mutations, two different types of the virus may be present in the same host cell and recombine, forming a dramatically different strain. The challenge is and has been for some time, the development of a productive vaccine."

It can be presumed that a description of antigenic shift will follow its initial, or only, mention in the text. Antigenic shift is referenced once in the passage, in paragraph 13: “The second way the proteins can mutate is by antigenic shift , which refers to the process where two types of virions enter a host cell and then recombine, creating a new and very different strain of the virus.” This tells us that antigenic shift is the formation of a new strain of virus, developed from two separate virion types. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",

A slow shift in genes over time that leads to an epidemic – is incorrect because this is not mentioned in the passage. Neither antigenic drift nor shift involves a slow alteration in genes leading to an epidemic. Option D. The formation of a virus that can infect multiple species – is incorrect because, while this might seem correct when discussing antigenic shift, it is not the most accurate description of the phenomenon. It is the recombination of antigenic shift that allows it to be more infectious. Option E.

      "text": "(1). Approximately 40 to 50 million people died during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, all due to a parasite that is one-millionth of an inch long. As a ubiquitous part of our environment, this organism can only be seen with the aid of an electron microscope, yet it can wreak havoc on the cells of all living organisms. This parasite is called a virus.\n\n(2). A virion is a virus particle that consists of genetic instructions wrapped in a coat of protein. Their genes consist of either DNA or RNA that is protected by a coat of protein. This coat protects their genetic information and aids in detecting the appropriate host cells to invade. Some viruses are surrounded by a lipid membrane, and some are not. The former is called an enveloped virus, and the latter is called a naked virus. These parasites do not have enzymes to carry out their chemical reactions and are entirely dependent on a host to make copies of themselves. Hosts include plants, bacteria, archaea, and animals. Because they don’t have the biochemical machinery to carry out their functions, they also have the advantage of laying dormant for years as they wait for a host cell to aid them in reproduction.\n\n(3). There are two ways for a virus to reproduce. The first one, used by the common cold and flu viruses, is called the lytic cycle. As soon as the virus enters the host organism, the protein on the virus coat detects the appropriate host cell to invade. It then inserts itself into the wall of the host cell and releases its genetic material inside. This injected genetic material then utilizes the host’s metabolic processes and recruits the enzymes of the host cell to begin making new DNA or RNA strands along with new proteins for the outer wall. As soon as this is complete, the new particles assemble. They then break free either by lysis, which refers to the destruction of the cell or by budding, in which the new virions pinch out of the cell membrane and then carry a piece of the existing membrane with them. Now that there are more virions, they can spread and continue through a new lytic cycle.\\\n\n(4). As the virions multiply and spread, the body’s immune response is often triggered and produces pyrogens. This response causes the body’s temperature to rise to induce a fever, which, in turn, causes metabolic processes in the body to slow down. Normally the human body functions most efficiently at 37°C. A higher temperature causes the processes to slow down, slowing the metabolism of the host cells and the multiplication of the virions within the host cells.\n\n(5). The other cycle of multiplication is called the lysogenic cycle. This cycle is utilized by viruses that cause herpes and HIV. At the beginning of this cycle, the viruses invade the host’s cells, but they do not multiply. Instead, they mix their genes with the genes of the host so that when the host cell reproduces, the virus’s genetics are copied into the host cell’s offspring. They then often lie dormant until some environmental or genetic event triggers them, causing them to enter the lytic cycle and spread. Therefore, patients with HIV tend not to show symptoms of illness for years after contracting the virus, although the host is still contagious during this time. Perhaps the most infamous exemplification of this process occurred when Magic Johnson, a global icon at the time, announced his HIV-positive status in 1991. The news shocked the sports world and brought powerful awareness overnight.\n\n(6). Johnson’s choice to go public with his HIV diagnosis was impactful for numerous reasons. In 1991, when Johnson made his announcement, those with HIV were often at the center of condemnation. It was a disease that much of the public believed was limited to marginalized communities and was also thought of as leading to a certain death since there existed no cure for the illness at the time. Johnson, being a high-profile celebrity and beloved sports figure, effectively challenged many people’s notions of HIV in terms of who it can impact. The athlete’s announcement humanized the disease in the eyes of many, leading to discussions surrounding prevention, testing, and treatment becoming much more commonplace. Johnson received significant praise for his decision to publicly announce his diagnosis and continues to advocate for reduced stigma of HIV, demonstrating that it is possible to live a full and healthy life as an HIV-positive individual.\n\n(7). Viruses spread through many different means. They can use a carrier organism such as a mosquito or a fly to invade their next host, or they can travel through the air; or can transfer through direct contact of bodily fluids including blood, saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, sweat, or nasal discharge.\n\n(8). Even though viruses cannot carry out their life cycle without a host, they are still susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures that affect other organisms precisely because they rely on other living organisms. If they are to successfully multiply and spread to new hosts, they must carry genes that allow this to happen. If they house genes that do not allow them to multiply effectively, perhaps killing the host within a few hours, those specific genes will disappear forever. On the other hand, if the viruses’ genes are very successful at keeping the host alive and causing the host to spread its viral offspring, this virus will be successful.\n\n(9). As part of the evolutionary arms race, host bodies busily create antibodies that can detect known viruses and lock them into their outer protein surface, thus preventing them from entering the host’s cells. When a mutation in the protein of the virion occurs, it becomes unrecognizable to the host’s antibodies, and the virus is suddenly successful. It will again be able to quickly multiply while the host’s body is busy trying to recognize the new virus and create the appropriate antibodies.\n\n(10). Viruses can make millions of copies of themselves in seconds, which means that their mutation rate is much higher than in an organism that reproduces much more slowly. However, there is a difference in mutation rates between RNA virions and DNA virions. Viruses with DNA are more stable due to a proofreading check, which they have as part of their reproduction process. These virions use the host cell to check their DNA replication. If there is a mistake in the reproductive process, the host cell is often able to correct it. Therefore, viruses containing DNA do not mutate as frequently as RNA viruses. Two known RNA viruses include the influenza virus and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. As a result, these two viruses are of particular interest to scientists.\n\n(11). When a person receives a vaccination, a small amount of virus is injected into their body, allowing the person’s immune system to create antibodies before they are exposed to the virus from the natural environment. Once they are exposed to the virus, the pre-existing antibodies will be able to quickly recognize and protect the person against the known virus before it can invade. However, RNA viruses such as the influenza virus, which causes the flu, have a high rate of mutation, which means that each year scientists must predict likely mutations in the flu virus to develop an effective vaccination.\n\n(12). There are three types of influenza virus: A, B, and C. Type A influenza virus could infect an array of organisms including humans, pigs, dogs, horses, and birds. Along with the fact that it is an RNA virus, this wide range of hosts means that it has more possibility for mutations. Mutations in influenza virus A are limited to the virus’ surface proteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. You may have heard of the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009. The name H1N1 refers to mutations in these two proteins. In contrast, influenza virus types B and C are not able to infect other species, and therefore their mutation rate is much slower.\n\n(13). There are two ways in which these proteins can mutate. The first is by antigenic drift, which refers to mutations in the genetic code as a virus reproduces within a cell. The genetic code of an ancestral virus drifts as it accumulates mutations in its proteins.

Thus, we should search the passage for paragraphs relating to this subject; this will allow us to locate the information necessary to ascertain the veracity and relatedness of both the statement and reason in the question stem. In paragraph 8, the author mentions the statement below. This tells us that mutations allow viruses to successfully spread. “When a mutation in the protein of the virion occurs, it becomes unrecognizable to the host’s antibodies and the virus is swiftly successful once more. It will again be able to quickly multiply, while the host’s body is busy attempting to recognize the newly mutated virus and create the appropriate antibodies.” In paragraph 13, the author mentions the statement below. This tells us that the spreading of mutated viruses can cause a pandemic. “Should this new virus be successful at reproducing and spreading, it can lead to a pandemic.” Altogether, paragraphs 8 and 13 tell us that pandemics can occur because of a mutation in a virus that has allowed it to successfully spread; hence, both the statement and reason in the question stem are correct and related. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Both the statement and the reason are correct but NOT related – is incorrect because the statement and reason are related.

      "title": "Passage 1",
      "text": "(1). Approximately 40 to 50 million people died during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, all due to a parasite that is one-millionth of an inch long. As a ubiquitous part of our environment, this organism can only be seen with the aid of an electron microscope, yet it can wreak havoc on the cells of all living organisms. This parasite is called a virus.\n\n(2). A virion is a virus particle that consists of genetic instructions wrapped in a coat of protein. Their genes consist of either DNA or RNA that is protected by a coat of protein. This coat protects their genetic information and aids in detecting the appropriate host cells to invade. Some viruses are surrounded by a lipid membrane, and some are not. The former is called an enveloped virus, and the latter is called a naked virus. These parasites do not have enzymes to carry out their chemical reactions and are entirely dependent on a host to make copies of themselves. Hosts include plants, bacteria, archaea, and animals. Because they don’t have the biochemical machinery to carry out their functions, they also have the advantage of laying dormant for years as they wait for a host cell to aid them in reproduction.\n\n(3). There are two ways for a virus to reproduce. The first one, used by the common cold and flu viruses, is called the lytic cycle. As soon as the virus enters the host organism, the protein on the virus coat detects the appropriate host cell to invade. It then inserts itself into the wall of the host cell and releases its genetic material inside. This injected genetic material then utilizes the host’s metabolic processes and recruits the enzymes of the host cell to begin making new DNA or RNA strands along with new proteins for the outer wall. As soon as this is complete, the new particles assemble. They then break free either by lysis, which refers to the destruction of the cell or by budding, in which the new virions pinch out of the cell membrane and then carry a piece of the existing membrane with them. Now that there are more virions, they can spread and continue through a new lytic cycle.\\\n\n(4). As the virions multiply and spread, the body’s immune response is often triggered and produces pyrogens. This response causes the body’s temperature to rise to induce a fever, which, in turn, causes metabolic processes in the body to slow down. Normally the human body functions most efficiently at 37°C. A higher temperature causes the processes to slow down, slowing the metabolism of the host cells and the multiplication of the virions within the host cells.\n\n(5). The other cycle of multiplication is called the lysogenic cycle. This cycle is utilized by viruses that cause herpes and HIV. At the beginning of this cycle, the viruses invade the host’s cells, but they do not multiply. Instead, they mix their genes with the genes of the host so that when the host cell reproduces, the virus’s genetics are copied into the host cell’s offspring. They then often lie dormant until some environmental or genetic event triggers them, causing them to enter the lytic cycle and spread. Therefore, patients with HIV tend not to show symptoms of illness for years after contracting the virus, although the host is still contagious during this time. Perhaps the most infamous exemplification of this process occurred when Magic Johnson, a global icon at the time, announced his HIV-positive status in 1991. The news shocked the sports world and brought powerful awareness overnight.\n\n(6). Johnson’s choice to go public with his HIV diagnosis was impactful for numerous reasons. In 1991, when Johnson made his announcement, those with HIV were often at the center of condemnation. It was a disease that much of the public believed was limited to marginalized communities and was also thought of as leading to a certain death since there existed no cure for the illness at the time. Johnson, being a high-profile celebrity and beloved sports figure, effectively challenged many people’s notions of HIV in terms of who it can impact. The athlete’s announcement humanized the disease in the eyes of many, leading to discussions surrounding prevention, testing, and treatment becoming much more commonplace. Johnson received significant praise for his decision to publicly announce his diagnosis and continues to advocate for reduced stigma of HIV, demonstrating that it is possible to live a full and healthy life as an HIV-positive individual.\n\n(7). Viruses spread through many different means. They can use a carrier organism such as a mosquito or a fly to invade their next host, or they can travel through the air; or can transfer through direct contact of bodily fluids including blood, saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, sweat, or nasal discharge.\n\n(8). Even though viruses cannot carry out their life cycle without a host, they are still susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures that affect other organisms precisely because they rely on other living organisms. If they are to successfully multiply and spread to new hosts, they must carry genes that allow this to happen. If they house genes that do not allow them to multiply effectively, perhaps killing the host within a few hours, those specific genes will disappear forever. On the other hand, if the viruses’ genes are very successful at keeping the host alive and causing the host to spread its viral offspring, this virus will be successful.\n\n(9). As part of the evolutionary arms race, host bodies busily create antibodies that can detect known viruses and lock them into their outer protein surface, thus preventing them from entering the host’s cells. When a mutation in the protein of the virion occurs, it becomes unrecognizable to the host’s antibodies, and the virus is suddenly successful. It will again be able to quickly multiply while the host’s body is busy trying to recognize the new virus and create the appropriate antibodies.\n\n(10). Viruses can make millions of copies of themselves in seconds, which means that their mutation rate is much higher than in an organism that reproduces much more slowly. However, there is a difference in mutation rates between RNA virions and DNA virions. Viruses with DNA are more stable due to a proofreading check, which they have as part of their reproduction process. These virions use the host cell to check their DNA replication. If there is a mistake in the reproductive process, the host cell is often able to correct it. Therefore, viruses containing DNA do not mutate as frequently as RNA viruses. Two known RNA viruses include the influenza virus and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. As a result, these two viruses are of particular interest to scientists.\n\n(11). When a person receives a vaccination, a small amount of virus is injected into their body, allowing the person’s immune system to create antibodies before they are exposed to the virus from the natural environment. Once they are exposed to the virus, the pre-existing antibodies will be able to quickly recognize and protect the person against the known virus before it can invade. However, RNA viruses such as the influenza virus, which causes the flu, have a high rate of mutation, which means that each year scientists must predict likely mutations in the flu virus to develop an effective vaccination.\n\n(12). There are three types of influenza virus: A, B, and C. Type A influenza virus could infect an array of organisms including humans, pigs, dogs, horses, and birds. Along with the fact that it is an RNA virus, this wide range of hosts means that it has more possibility for mutations. Mutations in influenza virus A are limited to the virus’ surface proteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. You may have heard of the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009. The name H1N1 refers to mutations in these two proteins. In contrast, influenza virus types B and C are not able to infect other species, and therefore their mutation rate is much slower.\n\n(13). There are two ways in which these proteins can mutate. The first is by antigenic drift, which refers to mutations in the genetic code as a virus reproduces within a cell. The genetic code of an ancestral virus drifts as it accumulates mutations in its proteins. When scientists develop flu shots, they aim to predict the accumulation of mutations in the coming flu season. Sometimes scientists can predict with some accuracy, and other times they may miss altogether.\n\n(14). The second is by antigenic shift, which refers to the process where two types of virions enter a host cell and then recombine, creating a new and very different strain of the virus. Because this strain is so dissimilar from either parent virus, it is difficult for the host’s immune system to detect. If this new virus is successful at reproducing and spreading, it could lead to a pandemic.\n\n(15). Because influenza A can infect different species, it has more opportunities to mutate or recombine and create new strains of the virus. If the pig flu and the human flu enter the same host cell in a bird, they may recombine and create a dramatically different type of influenza strain. If this new strain mutates and spreads in a given organism, it has devastating potential. In 2003, the H5N1 strain, or bird flu, scared many people in that it was drastically different from previous strains. Had it been successful at spreading, it would not have been recognized by human immune systems. However, this strain did not spread easily among humans and thus, did not turn into a pandemic.\n\n(16). Human infections of bird flu, or 'avian influenza,' are uncommon. When infections do occur, they usually result from close contact with infected birds, often in highly contaminated areas like chicken farms or wet markets. Symptoms of bird flu in humans can vary widely, including fever, eye irritation, upper respiratory issues like sore throat and cough, as well as headaches, muscle aches, and, in some cases, seizures. Symptoms typically appear around three to five days after the initial infection. Although such an outcome is very rare, bird flu can sometimes be fatal in humans should it lead to pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, or organ failure. It is difficult to ascertain when or if a bird flu would lead to an actual pandemic within the human population. Scientists can only keep track of the disease and research how it spreads and progresses over time.\n\n(17). Another RNA virus with unique properties is HIV. It is capable of producing copies quicker than other viruses, sometimes making more than a billion copies in a day. Because of its quick multiplication, mutations occur frequently; and because of the prevalence of mutations, two different types of the virus may be present in the same host cell and recombine, forming a dramatically different strain. The challenge is and has been for some time, the development of a productive vaccine."

These parasites do not have enzymes to carry out their chemical reactions and are entirely dependent on a host to make copies of themselves. Hosts include plants, bacteria, archaea, and animals. Because they don’t have the biochemical machinery to carry out their functions, they also have the advantage of laying dormant for years as they wait for a host cell to aid them in reproduction.\n\n(3). There are two ways for a virus to reproduce. The first one, used by the common cold and flu viruses, is called the lytic cycle. As soon as the virus enters the host organism, the protein on the virus coat detects the appropriate host cell to invade. It then inserts itself into the wall of the host cell and releases its genetic material inside. This injected genetic material then utilizes the host’s metabolic processes and recruits the enzymes of the host cell to begin making new DNA or RNA strands along with new proteins for the outer wall. As soon as this is complete, the new particles assemble. They then break free either by lysis, which refers to the destruction of the cell or by budding, in which the new virions pinch out of the cell membrane and then carry a piece of the existing membrane with them. Now that there are more virions, they can spread and continue through a new lytic cycle.\\\n\n(4). As the virions multiply and spread, the body’s immune response is often triggered and produces pyrogens. This response causes the body’s temperature to rise to induce a fever, which, in turn, causes metabolic processes in the body to slow down. Normally the human body functions most efficiently at 37°C. A higher temperature causes the processes to slow down, slowing the metabolism of the host cells and the multiplication of the virions within the host cells.\n\n(5). The other cycle of multiplication is called the lysogenic cycle. This cycle is utilized by viruses that cause herpes and HIV. At the beginning of this cycle, the viruses invade the host’s cells, but they do not multiply. Instead, they mix their genes with the genes of the host so that when the host cell reproduces, the virus’s genetics are copied into the host cell’s offspring. They then often lie dormant until some environmental or genetic event triggers them, causing them to enter the lytic cycle and spread. Therefore, patients with HIV tend not to show symptoms of illness for years after contracting the virus, although the host is still contagious during this time. Perhaps the most infamous exemplification of this process occurred when Magic Johnson, a global icon at the time, announced his HIV-positive status in 1991. The news shocked the sports world and brought powerful awareness overnight.\n\n(6). Johnson’s choice to go public with his HIV diagnosis was impactful for numerous reasons. In 1991, when Johnson made his announcement, those with HIV were often at the center of condemnation. It was a disease that much of the public believed was limited to marginalized communities and was also thought of as leading to a certain death since there existed no cure for the illness at the time. Johnson, being a high-profile celebrity and beloved sports figure, effectively challenged many people’s notions of HIV in terms of who it can impact. The athlete’s announcement humanized the disease in the eyes of many, leading to discussions surrounding prevention, testing, and treatment becoming much more commonplace. Johnson received significant praise for his decision to publicly announce his diagnosis and continues to advocate for reduced stigma of HIV, demonstrating that it is possible to live a full and healthy life as an HIV-positive individual.\n\n(7). Viruses spread through many different means. They can use a carrier organism such as a mosquito or a fly to invade their next host, or they can travel through the air; or can transfer through direct contact of bodily fluids including blood, saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, sweat, or nasal discharge.\n\n(8). Even though viruses cannot carry out their life cycle without a host, they are still susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures that affect other organisms precisely because they rely on other living organisms. If they are to successfully multiply and spread to new hosts, they must carry genes that allow this to happen. If they house genes that do not allow them to multiply effectively, perhaps killing the host within a few hours, those specific genes will disappear forever. On the other hand, if the viruses’ genes are very successful at keeping the host alive and causing the host to spread its viral offspring, this virus will be successful.\n\n(9). As part of the evolutionary arms race, host bodies busily create antibodies that can detect known viruses and lock them into their outer protein surface, thus preventing them from entering the host’s cells. When a mutation in the protein of the virion occurs, it becomes unrecognizable to the host’s antibodies, and the virus is suddenly successful. It will again be able to quickly multiply while the host’s body is busy trying to recognize the new virus and create the appropriate antibodies.\n\n(10). Viruses can make millions of copies of themselves in seconds, which means that their mutation rate is much higher than in an organism that reproduces much more slowly. However, there is a difference in mutation rates between RNA virions and DNA virions. Viruses with DNA are more stable due to a proofreading check, which they have as part of their reproduction process. These virions use the host cell to check their DNA replication. If there is a mistake in the reproductive process, the host cell is often able to correct it. Therefore, viruses containing DNA do not mutate as frequently as RNA viruses. Two known RNA viruses include the influenza virus and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. As a result, these two viruses are of particular interest to scientists.\n\n(11). When a person receives a vaccination, a small amount of virus is injected into their body, allowing the person’s immune system to create antibodies before they are exposed to the virus from the natural environment. Once they are exposed to the virus, the pre-existing antibodies will be able to quickly recognize and protect the person against the known virus before it can invade. However, RNA viruses such as the influenza virus, which causes the flu, have a high rate of mutation, which means that each year scientists must predict likely mutations in the flu virus to develop an effective vaccination.\n\n(12). There are three types of influenza virus: A, B, and C. Type A influenza virus could infect an array of organisms including humans, pigs, dogs, horses, and birds. Along with the fact that it is an RNA virus, this wide range of hosts means that it has more possibility for mutations. Mutations in influenza virus A are limited to the virus’ surface proteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. You may have heard of the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009. The name H1N1 refers to mutations in these two proteins. In contrast, influenza virus types B and C are not able to infect other species, and therefore their mutation rate is much slower.\n\n(13). There are two ways in which these proteins can mutate. The first is by antigenic drift, which refers to mutations in the genetic code as a virus reproduces within a cell. The genetic code of an ancestral virus drifts as it accumulates mutations in its proteins. When scientists develop flu shots, they aim to predict the accumulation of mutations in the coming flu season. Sometimes scientists can predict with some accuracy, and other times they may miss altogether.\n\n(14). The second is by antigenic shift, which refers to the process where two types of virions enter a host cell and then recombine, creating a new and very different strain of the virus. Because this strain is so dissimilar from either parent virus, it is difficult for the host’s immune system to detect. If this new virus is successful at reproducing and spreading, it could lead to a pandemic.\n\n(15). Because influenza A can infect different species, it has more opportunities to mutate or recombine and create new strains of the virus. If the pig flu and the human flu enter the same host cell in a bird, they may recombine and create a dramatically different type of influenza strain. If this new strain mutates and spreads in a given organism, it has devastating potential. In 2003, the H5N1 strain, or bird flu, scared many people in that it was drastically different from previous strains. Had it been successful at spreading, it would not have been recognized by human immune systems. However, this strain did not spread easily among humans and thus, did not turn into a pandemic.\n\n(16). Human infections of bird flu, or 'avian influenza,' are uncommon. When infections do occur, they usually result from close contact with infected birds, often in highly contaminated areas like chicken farms or wet markets. Symptoms of bird flu in humans can vary widely, including fever, eye irritation, upper respiratory issues like sore throat and cough, as well as headaches, muscle aches, and, in some cases, seizures. Symptoms typically appear around three to five days after the initial infection. Although such an outcome is very rare, bird flu can sometimes be fatal in humans should it lead to pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, or organ failure. It is difficult to ascertain when or if a bird flu would lead to an actual pandemic within the human population. Scientists can only keep track of the disease and research how it spreads and progresses over time.\n\n(17). Another RNA virus with unique properties is HIV. It is capable of producing copies quicker than other viruses, sometimes making more than a billion copies in a day. Because of its quick multiplication, mutations occur frequently; and because of the prevalence of mutations, two different types of the virus may be present in the same host cell and recombine, forming a dramatically different strain. The challenge is and has been for some time, the development of a productive vaccine."

      "text": "(1). Approximately 40 to 50 million people died during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, all due to a parasite that is one-millionth of an inch long. As a ubiquitous part of our environment, this organism can only be seen with the aid of an electron microscope, yet it can wreak havoc on the cells of all living organisms.

They can use a carrier organism such as a mosquito or a fly to invade their next host, or they can travel through the air; or can transfer through direct contact of bodily fluids including blood, saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, sweat, or nasal discharge.\n\n(8). Even though viruses cannot carry out their life cycle without a host, they are still susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures that affect other organisms precisely because they rely on other living organisms. If they are to successfully multiply and spread to new hosts, they must carry genes that allow this to happen. If they house genes that do not allow them to multiply effectively, perhaps killing the host within a few hours, those specific genes will disappear forever. On the other hand, if the viruses’ genes are very successful at keeping the host alive and causing the host to spread its viral offspring, this virus will be successful.\n\n(9). As part of the evolutionary arms race, host bodies busily create antibodies that can detect known viruses and lock them into their outer protein surface, thus preventing them from entering the host’s cells. When a mutation in the protein of the virion occurs, it becomes unrecognizable to the host’s antibodies, and the virus is suddenly successful. It will again be able to quickly multiply while the host’s body is busy trying to recognize the new virus and create the appropriate antibodies.\n\n(10). Viruses can make millions of copies of themselves in seconds, which means that their mutation rate is much higher than in an organism that reproduces much more slowly. However, there is a difference in mutation rates between RNA virions and DNA virions. Viruses with DNA are more stable due to a proofreading check, which they have as part of their reproduction process. These virions use the host cell to check their DNA replication. If there is a mistake in the reproductive process, the host cell is often able to correct it. Therefore, viruses containing DNA do not mutate as frequently as RNA viruses. Two known RNA viruses include the influenza virus and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. As a result, these two viruses are of particular interest to scientists.\n\n(11). When a person receives a vaccination, a small amount of virus is injected into their body, allowing the person’s immune system to create antibodies before they are exposed to the virus from the natural environment. Once they are exposed to the virus, the pre-existing antibodies will be able to quickly recognize and protect the person against the known virus before it can invade. However, RNA viruses such as the influenza virus, which causes the flu, have a high rate of mutation, which means that each year scientists must predict likely mutations in the flu virus to develop an effective vaccination.\n\n(12). There are three types of influenza virus: A, B, and C. Type A influenza virus could infect an array of organisms including humans, pigs, dogs, horses, and birds. Along with the fact that it is an RNA virus, this wide range of hosts means that it has more possibility for mutations. Mutations in influenza virus A are limited to the virus’ surface proteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. You may have heard of the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009. The name H1N1 refers to mutations in these two proteins. In contrast, influenza virus types B and C are not able to infect other species, and therefore their mutation rate is much slower.\n\n(13). There are two ways in which these proteins can mutate. The first is by antigenic drift, which refers to mutations in the genetic code as a virus reproduces within a cell. The genetic code of an ancestral virus drifts as it accumulates mutations in its proteins. When scientists develop flu shots, they aim to predict the accumulation of mutations in the coming flu season. Sometimes scientists can predict with some accuracy, and other times they may miss altogether.\n\n(14). The second is by antigenic shift, which refers to the process where two types of virions enter a host cell and then recombine, creating a new and very different strain of the virus. Because this strain is so dissimilar from either parent virus, it is difficult for the host’s immune system to detect. If this new virus is successful at reproducing and spreading, it could lead to a pandemic.\n\n(15). Because influenza A can infect different species, it has more opportunities to mutate or recombine and create new strains of the virus. If the pig flu and the human flu enter the same host cell in a bird, they may recombine and create a dramatically different type of influenza strain. If this new strain mutates and spreads in a given organism, it has devastating potential. In 2003, the H5N1 strain, or bird flu, scared many people in that it was drastically different from previous strains. Had it been successful at spreading, it would not have been recognized by human immune systems. However, this strain did not spread easily among humans and thus, did not turn into a pandemic.\n\n(16). Human infections of bird flu, or 'avian influenza,' are uncommon. When infections do occur, they usually result from close contact with infected birds, often in highly contaminated areas like chicken farms or wet markets. Symptoms of bird flu in humans can vary widely, including fever, eye irritation, upper respiratory issues like sore throat and cough, as well as headaches, muscle aches, and, in some cases, seizures. Symptoms typically appear around three to five days after the initial infection. Although such an outcome is very rare, bird flu can sometimes be fatal in humans should it lead to pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, or organ failure. It is difficult to ascertain when or if a bird flu would lead to an actual pandemic within the human population. Scientists can only keep track of the disease and research how it spreads and progresses over time.\n\n(17). Another RNA virus with unique properties is HIV. It is capable of producing copies quicker than other viruses, sometimes making more than a billion copies in a day. Because of its quick multiplication, mutations occur frequently; and because of the prevalence of mutations, two different types of the virus may be present in the same host cell and recombine, forming a dramatically different strain. The challenge is and has been for some time, the development of a productive vaccine."

The paragraph uses Magic Johnson as an example of a patient with HIV who did not show symptoms for many years. It reads: “Therefore, patients with HIV tend not to show symptoms of illness for years after contracting the virus, although the host patient is still contagious during this time. Perhaps the most infamous exemplification of this process occurred when Magic Johnson, a global icon at the time, announced his HIV-positive status in 1991. The news about Johnson shocked the sports world and brought powerful awareness about HIV to light overnight.” Thus, Magic was mentioned as a means of underscoring the dormant nature of HIV. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. He was mentioned as a means of humanizing HIV – is incorrect because, while providing an example of a well-known figure with HIV makes the disease seem more real, this is not the best way to describe the impact of mentioning Magic in the passage.

He was mentioned to show that HIV does not discriminate between health, race, or standing – is incorrect because, while providing an example of a well-known figure makes HIV appear less discriminatory, this is not the best way to describe the impact of mentioning Magic in the passage. Mentioning Magic provides an example of how HIV can remain dormant for many years. Option D. He was mentioned to show HIV can remain dormant for more than 10 years – is incorrect because, while this is almost correct, there is no mention of how HIV can remain dormant for only 10 years. Option E. The mention of Magic made no contribution to the passage – is incorrect because mentioning Magic does serve a purpose – it tells the reader that HIV can remain dormant for many years.",

      "text": "(1). Approximately 40 to 50 million people died during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, all due to a parasite that is one-millionth of an inch long. As a ubiquitous part of our environment, this organism can only be seen with the aid of an electron microscope, yet it can wreak havoc on the cells of all living organisms. This parasite is called a virus.\n\n(2). A virion is a virus particle that consists of genetic instructions wrapped in a coat of protein. Their genes consist of either DNA or RNA that is protected by a coat of protein. This coat protects their genetic information and aids in detecting the appropriate host cells to invade. Some viruses are surrounded by a lipid membrane, and some are not. The former is called an enveloped virus, and the latter is called a naked virus. These parasites do not have enzymes to carry out their chemical reactions and are entirely dependent on a host to make copies of themselves. Hosts include plants, bacteria, archaea, and animals. Because they don’t have the biochemical machinery to carry out their functions, they also have the advantage of laying dormant for years as they wait for a host cell to aid them in reproduction.\n\n(3). There are two ways for a virus to reproduce. The first one, used by the common cold and flu viruses, is called the lytic cycle. As soon as the virus enters the host organism, the protein on the virus coat detects the appropriate host cell to invade. It then inserts itself into the wall of the host cell and releases its genetic material inside. This injected genetic material then utilizes the host’s metabolic processes and recruits the enzymes of the host cell to begin making new DNA or RNA strands along with new proteins for the outer wall. As soon as this is complete, the new particles assemble. They then break free either by lysis, which refers to the destruction of the cell or by budding, in which the new virions pinch out of the cell membrane and then carry a piece of the existing membrane with them. Now that there are more virions, they can spread and continue through a new lytic cycle.\\\n\n(4). As the virions multiply and spread, the body’s immune response is often triggered and produces pyrogens. This response causes the body’s temperature to rise to induce a fever, which, in turn, causes metabolic processes in the body to slow down. Normally the human body functions most efficiently at 37°C. A higher temperature causes the processes to slow down, slowing the metabolism of the host cells and the multiplication of the virions within the host cells.\n\n(5). The other cycle of multiplication is called the lysogenic cycle. This cycle is utilized by viruses that cause herpes and HIV. At the beginning of this cycle, the viruses invade the host’s cells, but they do not multiply. Instead, they mix their genes with the genes of the host so that when the host cell reproduces, the virus’s genetics are copied into the host cell’s offspring. They then often lie dormant until some environmental or genetic event triggers them, causing them to enter the lytic cycle and spread. Therefore, patients with HIV tend not to show symptoms of illness for years after contracting the virus, although the host is still contagious during this time. Perhaps the most infamous exemplification of this process occurred when Magic Johnson, a global icon at the time, announced his HIV-positive status in 1991. The news shocked the sports world and brought powerful awareness overnight.\n\n(6). Johnson’s choice to go public with his HIV diagnosis was impactful for numerous reasons. In 1991, when Johnson made his announcement, those with HIV were often at the center of condemnation. It was a disease that much of the public believed was limited to marginalized communities and was also thought of as leading to a certain death since there existed no cure for the illness at the time. Johnson, being a high-profile celebrity and beloved sports figure, effectively challenged many people’s notions of HIV in terms of who it can impact. The athlete’s announcement humanized the disease in the eyes of many, leading to discussions surrounding prevention, testing, and treatment becoming much more commonplace. Johnson received significant praise for his decision to publicly announce his diagnosis and continues to advocate for reduced stigma of HIV, demonstrating that it is possible to live a full and healthy life as an HIV-positive individual.\n\n(7).

Along with the fact that it is an RNA virus, this wide range of hosts means that it has more possibility for mutations. Mutations in influenza virus A are limited to the virus’ surface proteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. You may have heard of the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009. The name H1N1 refers to mutations in these two proteins. In contrast, influenza virus types B and C are not able to infect other species, and therefore their mutation rate is much slower.\n\n(13). There are two ways in which these proteins can mutate. The first is by antigenic drift, which refers to mutations in the genetic code as a virus reproduces within a cell. The genetic code of an ancestral virus drifts as it accumulates mutations in its proteins. When scientists develop flu shots, they aim to predict the accumulation of mutations in the coming flu season. Sometimes scientists can predict with some accuracy, and other times they may miss altogether.\n\n(14). The second is by antigenic shift, which refers to the process where two types of virions enter a host cell and then recombine, creating a new and very different strain of the virus. Because this strain is so dissimilar from either parent virus, it is difficult for the host’s immune system to detect. If this new virus is successful at reproducing and spreading, it could lead to a pandemic.\n\n(15). Because influenza A can infect different species, it has more opportunities to mutate or recombine and create new strains of the virus. If the pig flu and the human flu enter the same host cell in a bird, they may recombine and create a dramatically different type of influenza strain. If this new strain mutates and spreads in a given organism, it has devastating potential. In 2003, the H5N1 strain, or bird flu, scared many people in that it was drastically different from previous strains. Had it been successful at spreading, it would not have been recognized by human immune systems. However, this strain did not spread easily among humans and thus, did not turn into a pandemic.\n\n(16). Human infections of bird flu, or 'avian influenza,' are uncommon. When infections do occur, they usually result from close contact with infected birds, often in highly contaminated areas like chicken farms or wet markets. Symptoms of bird flu in humans can vary widely, including fever, eye irritation, upper respiratory issues like sore throat and cough, as well as headaches, muscle aches, and, in some cases, seizures. Symptoms typically appear around three to five days after the initial infection. Although such an outcome is very rare, bird flu can sometimes be fatal in humans should it lead to pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, or organ failure. It is difficult to ascertain when or if a bird flu would lead to an actual pandemic within the human population. Scientists can only keep track of the disease and research how it spreads and progresses over time.\n\n(17). Another RNA virus with unique properties is HIV. It is capable of producing copies quicker than other viruses, sometimes making more than a billion copies in a day. Because of its quick multiplication, mutations occur frequently; and because of the prevalence of mutations, two different types of the virus may be present in the same host cell and recombine, forming a dramatically different strain. The challenge is and has been for some time, the development of a productive vaccine."

      "text": "(1). Approximately 40 to 50 million people died during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, all due to a parasite that is one-millionth of an inch long. As a ubiquitous part of our environment, this organism can only be seen with the aid of an electron microscope, yet it can wreak havoc on the cells of all living organisms. This parasite is called a virus.\n\n(2). A virion is a virus particle that consists of genetic instructions wrapped in a coat of protein. Their genes consist of either DNA or RNA that is protected by a coat of protein. This coat protects their genetic information and aids in detecting the appropriate host cells to invade. Some viruses are surrounded by a lipid membrane, and some are not. The former is called an enveloped virus, and the latter is called a naked virus. These parasites do not have enzymes to carry out their chemical reactions and are entirely dependent on a host to make copies of themselves. Hosts include plants, bacteria, archaea, and animals. Because they don’t have the biochemical machinery to carry out their functions, they also have the advantage of laying dormant for years as they wait for a host cell to aid them in reproduction.\n\n(3). There are two ways for a virus to reproduce. The first one, used by the common cold and flu viruses, is called the lytic cycle. As soon as the virus enters the host organism, the protein on the virus coat detects the appropriate host cell to invade. It then inserts itself into the wall of the host cell and releases its genetic material inside. This injected genetic material then utilizes the host’s metabolic processes and recruits the enzymes of the host cell to begin making new DNA or RNA strands along with new proteins for the outer wall. As soon as this is complete, the new particles assemble. They then break free either by lysis, which refers to the destruction of the cell or by budding, in which the new virions pinch out of the cell membrane and then carry a piece of the existing membrane with them. Now that there are more virions, they can spread and continue through a new lytic cycle.\\\n\n(4). As the virions multiply and spread, the body’s immune response is often triggered and produces pyrogens. This response causes the body’s temperature to rise to induce a fever, which, in turn, causes metabolic processes in the body to slow down. Normally the human body functions most efficiently at 37°C. A higher temperature causes the processes to slow down, slowing the metabolism of the host cells and the multiplication of the virions within the host cells.\n\n(5). The other cycle of multiplication is called the lysogenic cycle. This cycle is utilized by viruses that cause herpes and HIV. At the beginning of this cycle, the viruses invade the host’s cells, but they do not multiply. Instead, they mix their genes with the genes of the host so that when the host cell reproduces, the virus’s genetics are copied into the host cell’s offspring. They then often lie dormant until some environmental or genetic event triggers them, causing them to enter the lytic cycle and spread. Therefore, patients with HIV tend not to show symptoms of illness for years after contracting the virus, although the host is still contagious during this time. Perhaps the most infamous exemplification of this process occurred when Magic Johnson, a global icon at the time, announced his HIV-positive status in 1991. The news shocked the sports world and brought powerful awareness overnight.\n\n(6). Johnson’s choice to go public with his HIV diagnosis was impactful for numerous reasons. In 1991, when Johnson made his announcement, those with HIV were often at the center of condemnation. It was a disease that much of the public believed was limited to marginalized communities and was also thought of as leading to a certain death since there existed no cure for the illness at the time. Johnson, being a high-profile celebrity and beloved sports figure, effectively challenged many people’s notions of HIV in terms of who it can impact. The athlete’s announcement humanized the disease in the eyes of many, leading to discussions surrounding prevention, testing, and treatment becoming much more commonplace. Johnson received significant praise for his decision to publicly announce his diagnosis and continues to advocate for reduced stigma of HIV, demonstrating that it is possible to live a full and healthy life as an HIV-positive individual.\n\n(7). Viruses spread through many different means. They can use a carrier organism such as a mosquito or a fly to invade their next host, or they can travel through the air; or can transfer through direct contact of bodily fluids including blood, saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, sweat, or nasal discharge.\n\n(8). Even though viruses cannot carry out their life cycle without a host, they are still susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures that affect other organisms precisely because they rely on other living organisms. If they are to successfully multiply and spread to new hosts, they must carry genes that allow this to happen. If they house genes that do not allow them to multiply effectively, perhaps killing the host within a few hours, those specific genes will disappear forever. On the other hand, if the viruses’ genes are very successful at keeping the host alive and causing the host to spread its viral offspring, this virus will be successful.\n\n(9). As part of the evolutionary arms race, host bodies busily create antibodies that can detect known viruses and lock them into their outer protein surface, thus preventing them from entering the host’s cells. When a mutation in the protein of the virion occurs, it becomes unrecognizable to the host’s antibodies, and the virus is suddenly successful. It will again be able to quickly multiply while the host’s body is busy trying to recognize the new virus and create the appropriate antibodies.\n\n(10). Viruses can make millions of copies of themselves in seconds, which means that their mutation rate is much higher than in an organism that reproduces much more slowly. However, there is a difference in mutation rates between RNA virions and DNA virions. Viruses with DNA are more stable due to a proofreading check, which they have as part of their reproduction process. These virions use the host cell to check their DNA replication. If there is a mistake in the reproductive process, the host cell is often able to correct it. Therefore, viruses containing DNA do not mutate as frequently as RNA viruses. Two known RNA viruses include the influenza virus and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. As a result, these two viruses are of particular interest to scientists.\n\n(11). When a person receives a vaccination, a small amount of virus is injected into their body, allowing the person’s immune system to create antibodies before they are exposed to the virus from the natural environment. Once they are exposed to the virus, the pre-existing antibodies will be able to quickly recognize and protect the person against the known virus before it can invade. However, RNA viruses such as the influenza virus, which causes the flu, have a high rate of mutation, which means that each year scientists must predict likely mutations in the flu virus to develop an effective vaccination.\n\n(12). There are three types of influenza virus: A, B, and C. Type A influenza virus could infect an array of organisms including humans, pigs, dogs, horses, and birds.

      "title": "Passage 1",
      "text": "(1). Approximately 40 to 50 million people died during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, all due to a parasite that is one-millionth of an inch long. As a ubiquitous part of our environment, this organism can only be seen with the aid of an electron microscope, yet it can wreak havoc on the cells of all living organisms. This parasite is called a virus.\n\n(2). A virion is a virus particle that consists of genetic instructions wrapped in a coat of protein. Their genes consist of either DNA or RNA that is protected by a coat of protein. This coat protects their genetic information and aids in detecting the appropriate host cells to invade. Some viruses are surrounded by a lipid membrane, and some are not. The former is called an enveloped virus, and the latter is called a naked virus. These parasites do not have enzymes to carry out their chemical reactions and are entirely dependent on a host to make copies of themselves. Hosts include plants, bacteria, archaea, and animals. Because they don’t have the biochemical machinery to carry out their functions, they also have the advantage of laying dormant for years as they wait for a host cell to aid them in reproduction.\n\n(3). There are two ways for a virus to reproduce. The first one, used by the common cold and flu viruses, is called the lytic cycle. As soon as the virus enters the host organism, the protein on the virus coat detects the appropriate host cell to invade. It then inserts itself into the wall of the host cell and releases its genetic material inside. This injected genetic material then utilizes the host’s metabolic processes and recruits the enzymes of the host cell to begin making new DNA or RNA strands along with new proteins for the outer wall. As soon as this is complete, the new particles assemble. They then break free either by lysis, which refers to the destruction of the cell or by budding, in which the new virions pinch out of the cell membrane and then carry a piece of the existing membrane with them. Now that there are more virions, they can spread and continue through a new lytic cycle.\\\n\n(4). As the virions multiply and spread, the body’s immune response is often triggered and produces pyrogens. This response causes the body’s temperature to rise to induce a fever, which, in turn, causes metabolic processes in the body to slow down. Normally the human body functions most efficiently at 37°C. A higher temperature causes the processes to slow down, slowing the metabolism of the host cells and the multiplication of the virions within the host cells.\n\n(5). The other cycle of multiplication is called the lysogenic cycle. This cycle is utilized by viruses that cause herpes and HIV. At the beginning of this cycle, the viruses invade the host’s cells, but they do not multiply. Instead, they mix their genes with the genes of the host so that when the host cell reproduces, the virus’s genetics are copied into the host cell’s offspring. They then often lie dormant until some environmental or genetic event triggers them, causing them to enter the lytic cycle and spread. Therefore, patients with HIV tend not to show symptoms of illness for years after contracting the virus, although the host is still contagious during this time. Perhaps the most infamous exemplification of this process occurred when Magic Johnson, a global icon at the time, announced his HIV-positive status in 1991. The news shocked the sports world and brought powerful awareness overnight.\n\n(6). Johnson’s choice to go public with his HIV diagnosis was impactful for numerous reasons. In 1991, when Johnson made his announcement, those with HIV were often at the center of condemnation. It was a disease that much of the public believed was limited to marginalized communities and was also thought of as leading to a certain death since there existed no cure for the illness at the time. Johnson, being a high-profile celebrity and beloved sports figure, effectively challenged many people’s notions of HIV in terms of who it can impact. The athlete’s announcement humanized the disease in the eyes of many, leading to discussions surrounding prevention, testing, and treatment becoming much more commonplace. Johnson received significant praise for his decision to publicly announce his diagnosis and continues to advocate for reduced stigma of HIV, demonstrating that it is possible to live a full and healthy life as an HIV-positive individual.\n\n(7). Viruses spread through many different means. They can use a carrier organism such as a mosquito or a fly to invade their next host, or they can travel through the air; or can transfer through direct contact of bodily fluids including blood, saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, sweat, or nasal discharge.\n\n(8). Even though viruses cannot carry out their life cycle without a host, they are still susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures that affect other organisms precisely because they rely on other living organisms. If they are to successfully multiply and spread to new hosts, they must carry genes that allow this to happen. If they house genes that do not allow them to multiply effectively, perhaps killing the host within a few hours, those specific genes will disappear forever. On the other hand, if the viruses’ genes are very successful at keeping the host alive and causing the host to spread its viral offspring, this virus will be successful.\n\n(9). As part of the evolutionary arms race, host bodies busily create antibodies that can detect known viruses and lock them into their outer protein surface, thus preventing them from entering the host’s cells. When a mutation in the protein of the virion occurs, it becomes unrecognizable to the host’s antibodies, and the virus is suddenly successful. It will again be able to quickly multiply while the host’s body is busy trying to recognize the new virus and create the appropriate antibodies.\n\n(10). Viruses can make millions of copies of themselves in seconds, which means that their mutation rate is much higher than in an organism that reproduces much more slowly. However, there is a difference in mutation rates between RNA virions and DNA virions. Viruses with DNA are more stable due to a proofreading check, which they have as part of their reproduction process. These virions use the host cell to check their DNA replication. If there is a mistake in the reproductive process, the host cell is often able to correct it. Therefore, viruses containing DNA do not mutate as frequently as RNA viruses. Two known RNA viruses include the influenza virus and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. As a result, these two viruses are of particular interest to scientists.\n\n(11). When a person receives a vaccination, a small amount of virus is injected into their body, allowing the person’s immune system to create antibodies before they are exposed to the virus from the natural environment. Once they are exposed to the virus, the pre-existing antibodies will be able to quickly recognize and protect the person against the known virus before it can invade. However, RNA viruses such as the influenza virus, which causes the flu, have a high rate of mutation, which means that each year scientists must predict likely mutations in the flu virus to develop an effective vaccination.\n\n(12). There are three types of influenza virus: A, B, and C. Type A influenza virus could infect an array of organisms including humans, pigs, dogs, horses, and birds. Along with the fact that it is an RNA virus, this wide range of hosts means that it has more possibility for mutations. Mutations in influenza virus A are limited to the virus’ surface proteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. You may have heard of the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009. The name H1N1 refers to mutations in these two proteins. In contrast, influenza virus types B and C are not able to infect other species, and therefore their mutation rate is much slower.\n\n(13). There are two ways in which these proteins can mutate. The first is by antigenic drift, which refers to mutations in the genetic code as a virus reproduces within a cell. The genetic code of an ancestral virus drifts as it accumulates mutations in its proteins. When scientists develop flu shots, they aim to predict the accumulation of mutations in the coming flu season. Sometimes scientists can predict with some accuracy, and other times they may miss altogether.\n\n(14). The second is by antigenic shift, which refers to the process where two types of virions enter a host cell and then recombine, creating a new and very different strain of the virus. Because this strain is so dissimilar from either parent virus, it is difficult for the host’s immune system to detect. If this new virus is successful at reproducing and spreading, it could lead to a pandemic.\n\n(15). Because influenza A can infect different species, it has more opportunities to mutate or recombine and create new strains of the virus. If the pig flu and the human flu enter the same host cell in a bird, they may recombine and create a dramatically different type of influenza strain. If this new strain mutates and spreads in a given organism, it has devastating potential. In 2003, the H5N1 strain, or bird flu, scared many people in that it was drastically different from previous strains. Had it been successful at spreading, it would not have been recognized by human immune systems. However, this strain did not spread easily among humans and thus, did not turn into a pandemic.\n\n(16). Human infections of bird flu, or 'avian influenza,' are uncommon. When infections do occur, they usually result from close contact with infected birds, often in highly contaminated areas like chicken farms or wet markets. Symptoms of bird flu in humans can vary widely, including fever, eye irritation, upper respiratory issues like sore throat and cough, as well as headaches, muscle aches, and, in some cases, seizures. Symptoms typically appear around three to five days after the initial infection. Although such an outcome is very rare, bird flu can sometimes be fatal in humans should it lead to pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, or organ failure. It is difficult to ascertain when or if a bird flu would lead to an actual pandemic within the human population. Scientists can only keep track of the disease and research how it spreads and progresses over time.\n\n(17). Another RNA virus with unique properties is HIV. It is capable of producing copies quicker than other viruses, sometimes making more than a billion copies in a day. Because of its quick multiplication, mutations occur frequently; and because of the prevalence of mutations, two different types of the virus may be present in the same host cell and recombine, forming a dramatically different strain. The challenge is and has been for some time, the development of a productive vaccine."

      "text": "(1). Every 5 seconds, one person dies of cardiovascular disease and another two come down with a stroke. The World Health Organization recently reported that ischemic heart disease and stroke are the two leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Death due to heart conditions are most prominent in the United States, where 23% of total deaths are attributed to heart issues. One possible explanation for such a high prevalence of heart disease is an unhealthy lifestyle. Cardiovascular complications are a manifestation of both genetic and lifestyle factors, a concoction of nature and nurture.\n\n(2). Cardiovascular disease results from atherosclerosis – the hardening of coronary arteries leading to irregular blood flow to the heart and the rest of the body. Lipids, cholesterol, and dead white blood cells co-agglutinate to form plaque in the arterial wall and decrease the radius of the vessel. In the face of increased resistance, the blood must flow with more force which leads to increased blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension requires the heart to pump harder. A prolonged increase in pumping power causes the heart to grow in muscle mass. The accumulation of muscle in the heart is called hypertrophy, and it makes the heart pump less efficiently. In atherosclerosis, the partially blocked vessel also reduces the delivery of blood and its vital constituents to the heart. Insufficient oxygen delivery induces a hypoxic environment where cardiac cells become strained. Subsequently, the diminished capacity of the heart endangers other organs of the body. The most worrying situation is when the brain is affected.\n\n(3). As the heart drops in pumping power and blood flow slows, clotting ingredients have more opportunity to interact. The frequent interaction of platelets, clotting factors, and fibrin results in more clots. The most stubborn of these clots travel up the carotid arteries that feed blood to the brain and lodge into a narrow vessel. The blockage of this vessel leads to a phenomenon called ischemia, the inadequate supply of oxygen to an organ or group of cells. An ischemic stroke results from the barricade of a major blood vessel by a clot, lowering blood supply to brain cells. Since the brain tissue lacks pain receptors, the symptoms of a stroke are instead identified by cognitive and physical malfunctions. Therefore, a droopy face, imbalanced arms, and slurred speech are used as primary indicators of a stroke. Strokes are particularly malicious as they often involve damage to brain cells, which often cannot recover from any damage, thus necessitating fast treatment.\n\n(4). There are two main treatment options for an ischemic stroke. The first is tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) which is administered via intravenous fluid to break down the clot. Ideally, TPA is given within 4.5 hours of the initial onset of stroke, and it can restore blood flow to critical brain regions and prevent severe cognitive impairment. However, this method fails when confronted with a large clot. In this case, prompt surgical intervention in the form of endovascular thrombectomy would be required promptly to remove the clot. Once the precise location of the clot is located through a fluorescent dye and contrast imaging, a thin catheter is inserted from the ankle and guided to the spot of the blockage where it extracts the clot. Although the brain can be rescued from an ischemic stroke by decisive intervention, a malfunctioning heart is still portentous.\n\n(5). The plaques that reside in the coronary artery walls become more troublesome over time. The turbulent blood flow in partially blocked vessels can rupture the plaque. The broken off portion of this debris, called the thrombus, can initiate another plaque some distance away. Even worse, the newly exposed surface of the original plaque is highly thrombogenic. Thus, as blood cells arrive and agglutinate to the vacant spot, the plaque grows to a point where it might completely impede the flow of blood to cardiac cells and initiate heart failure.\n\n(6). Heart failure describes a gradual process where cardiac cells begin to die off one by one. The heart has not stopped beating at this point but its ability to pump blood progressively declines due to fewer functional muscle cells. The longer an ischemic event persists, the more severe the heart failure becomes. Once the death of cardiac muscle cells reaches a threshold level, chest pain emerges as one of the earliest indicators of a myocardial infarction or heart attack. Often severe heart attacks caused by arterial blockage can be resolved by angioplasty. This is a surgery where a metal stent that looks like a wiry mesh is inserted into the hardened region of the artery to artificially increase its radius and ease stress on the heart. If a heart attack is not identified in due time, the person’s condition continues to deteriorate. Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart ceases to pump. Once this happens, the rule of thumb is that a 3-minute window separates life and death. The death of heart cells to the point of cardiac arrest is irrevocable and the person would require a heart transplant to live.\n\n(7). It is abundantly clear that cardiac health must be a priority for us all. The process of taking care of one’s heart begins with identifying inborn dispositions. Part of the risk for heart attack depends on the non-modifiable factors of age, gender, and genetics. Older people have a higher tendency to develop plaque within their cardiovascular system because of the cumulative effects of their lifestyle. Keep in mind that by upholding a healthy lifestyle that includes exercise for example, some seniors may circumvent the harmful effects of plaque buildup. Moreover, males experience cardiovascular heart disease earlier and more frequently than women. The body of Research hints that the reason is that men adapt unhealthy coping habits when facing stress. Men are more likely to resort to smoking, alcohol, or unhealthy foods when it comes to dealing with anguish. The inability to accept and cope with one’s emotional turmoil has hazardous physical consequences. It has been proven once again that the advocacy for mental health also affects physical health.\n\n(8). Despite setting the hard limits of our cardiovascular health, the massive role of environmental factors cannot be ignored. The Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation maintains that 80% of heart and stroke diseases are preventable by adopting a balanced diet and a physically active lifestyle. A diet high in fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, reduced-fat dairy products, whole grains, and fish is especially recommended. The effect is seen in improved cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, manageable body weight, and reduced blood sugar. Augmenting such a diet with decreased sodium and saturated fats accentuates the benefits. Furthermore, at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise like raking the leaves, dancing, or playing sports when added to moderate alcohol consumption and tobacco cessation leads to reduced blood pressure and cholesterol. Not only that, but exercise takes care of other risk factors for heart disease by producing better sleep, lower levels of stress, and anti-aging effects. In general, the risk factors that are most associated with heart attack include a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, chronic stress, smoking, alcohol abuse, obesity, and both types of diabetes.\n\n(9). Genetics determines virtually every aspect of the cardiovascular blueprint, from the peculiar shape of capillaries to how the electrical signals are communicated to establish a rhythmic heart rate. If a mutation occurs in a key regulator of cardiac health, it will make a noticeable difference in the prognosis of heart disease. For example, a loss-of-function mutation in the enzyme that processes cholesterol would make it easier for such people to have blocked arteries. But as is the case for many physical ailments, our mind has the power to overcome matter. By employing discipline in everyday choices, you can reap the immeasurable rewards of a healthy heart."

Moreover, males experience cardiovascular heart disease earlier and more frequently than women. The body of Research hints that the reason is that men adapt unhealthy coping habits when facing stress. Men are more likely to resort to smoking, alcohol, or unhealthy foods when it comes to dealing with anguish. The inability to accept and cope with one’s emotional turmoil has hazardous physical consequences.

Despite setting the hard limits of our cardiovascular health, the massive role of environmental factors cannot be ignored.

A diet high in fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, reduced-fat dairy products, whole grains, and fish is especially recommended. The effect is seen in improved cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, manageable body weight, and reduced blood sugar. Augmenting such a diet with decreased sodium and saturated fats accentuates the benefits. Furthermore, at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise like raking the leaves, dancing, or playing sports when added to moderate alcohol consumption and tobacco cessation leads to reduced blood pressure and cholesterol. Not only that, but exercise takes care of other risk factors for heart disease by producing better sleep, lower levels of stress, and anti-aging effects. In general, the risk factors that are most associated with heart attack include a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, chronic stress, smoking, alcohol abuse, obesity, and both types of diabetes.\n\n(9).

      "text": "(1). Every 5 seconds, one person dies of cardiovascular disease and another two come down with a stroke. The World Health Organization recently reported that ischemic heart disease and stroke are the two leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Death due to heart conditions are most prominent in the United States, where 23% of total deaths are attributed to heart issues. One possible explanation for such a high prevalence of heart disease is an unhealthy lifestyle. Cardiovascular complications are a manifestation of both genetic and lifestyle factors, a concoction of nature and nurture.\n\n(2). Cardiovascular disease results from atherosclerosis – the hardening of coronary arteries leading to irregular blood flow to the heart and the rest of the body. Lipids, cholesterol, and dead white blood cells co-agglutinate to form plaque in the arterial wall and decrease the radius of the vessel. In the face of increased resistance, the blood must flow with more force which leads to increased blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension requires the heart to pump harder. A prolonged increase in pumping power causes the heart to grow in muscle mass. The accumulation of muscle in the heart is called hypertrophy, and it makes the heart pump less efficiently. In atherosclerosis, the partially blocked vessel also reduces the delivery of blood and its vital constituents to the heart. Insufficient oxygen delivery induces a hypoxic environment where cardiac cells become strained. Subsequently, the diminished capacity of the heart endangers other organs of the body. The most worrying situation is when the brain is affected.\n\n(3). As the heart drops in pumping power and blood flow slows, clotting ingredients have more opportunity to interact. The frequent interaction of platelets, clotting factors, and fibrin results in more clots. The most stubborn of these clots travel up the carotid arteries that feed blood to the brain and lodge into a narrow vessel. The blockage of this vessel leads to a phenomenon called ischemia, the inadequate supply of oxygen to an organ or group of cells. An ischemic stroke results from the barricade of a major blood vessel by a clot, lowering blood supply to brain cells. Since the brain tissue lacks pain receptors, the symptoms of a stroke are instead identified by cognitive and physical malfunctions. Therefore, a droopy face, imbalanced arms, and slurred speech are used as primary indicators of a stroke. Strokes are particularly malicious as they often involve damage to brain cells, which often cannot recover from any damage, thus necessitating fast treatment.\n\n(4). There are two main treatment options for an ischemic stroke. The first is tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) which is administered via intravenous fluid to break down the clot. Ideally, TPA is given within 4.5 hours of the initial onset of stroke, and it can restore blood flow to critical brain regions and prevent severe cognitive impairment. However, this method fails when confronted with a large clot. In this case, prompt surgical intervention in the form of endovascular thrombectomy would be required promptly to remove the clot. Once the precise location of the clot is located through a fluorescent dye and contrast imaging, a thin catheter is inserted from the ankle and guided to the spot of the blockage where it extracts the clot. Although the brain can be rescued from an ischemic stroke by decisive intervention, a malfunctioning heart is still portentous.\n\n(5). The plaques that reside in the coronary artery walls become more troublesome over time. The turbulent blood flow in partially blocked vessels can rupture the plaque. The broken off portion of this debris, called the thrombus, can initiate another plaque some distance away. Even worse, the newly exposed surface of the original plaque is highly thrombogenic. Thus, as blood cells arrive and agglutinate to the vacant spot, the plaque grows to a point where it might completely impede the flow of blood to cardiac cells and initiate heart failure.\n\n(6). Heart failure describes a gradual process where cardiac cells begin to die off one by one. The heart has not stopped beating at this point but its ability to pump blood progressively declines due to fewer functional muscle cells. The longer an ischemic event persists, the more severe the heart failure becomes. Once the death of cardiac muscle cells reaches a threshold level, chest pain emerges as one of the earliest indicators of a myocardial infarction or heart attack. Often severe heart attacks caused by arterial blockage can be resolved by angioplasty. This is a surgery where a metal stent that looks like a wiry mesh is inserted into the hardened region of the artery to artificially increase its radius and ease stress on the heart. If a heart attack is not identified in due time, the person’s condition continues to deteriorate. Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart ceases to pump. Once this happens, the rule of thumb is that a 3-minute window separates life and death. The death of heart cells to the point of cardiac arrest is irrevocable and the person would require a heart transplant to live.\n\n(7). It is abundantly clear that cardiac health must be a priority for us all. The process of taking care of one’s heart begins with identifying inborn dispositions. Part of the risk for heart attack depends on the non-modifiable factors of age, gender, and genetics.

Augmenting such a diet with decreased sodium and saturated fats accentuates the benefits. Furthermore, at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise like raking the leaves, dancing, or playing sports when added to moderate alcohol consumption and tobacco cessation leads to reduced blood pressure and cholesterol.

The reason is also supported by the quote from paragraph 3. (2) “A prolonged increase in pumping power causes the heart to grow in muscle mass. The accumulation of muscle in the heart is called hypertrophy, and it makes the heart pump less efficiently.” (3) “As the heart drops in pumping power and blood flow slows, clotting ingredients have more opportunity to interact. The frequent interaction of platelets, clotting factors, and fibrin results in more clots.” These quotes imply that muscular hearts are less efficient, which leads to slower blood flow that causes more clots. Thus, the statement and reason are both correct and related. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Both the statement and the reason are correct but NOT related – is incorrect because the statement and reason are related as more clotting interactions explain why a muscular and inefficient heart is prone to blockage.

      "text": "(1). Every 5 seconds, one person dies of cardiovascular disease and another two come down with a stroke. The World Health Organization recently reported that ischemic heart disease and stroke are the two leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Death due to heart conditions are most prominent in the United States, where 23% of total deaths are attributed to heart issues. One possible explanation for such a high prevalence of heart disease is an unhealthy lifestyle. Cardiovascular complications are a manifestation of both genetic and lifestyle factors, a concoction of nature and nurture.\n\n(2). Cardiovascular disease results from atherosclerosis – the hardening of coronary arteries leading to irregular blood flow to the heart and the rest of the body. Lipids, cholesterol, and dead white blood cells co-agglutinate to form plaque in the arterial wall and decrease the radius of the vessel. In the face of increased resistance, the blood must flow with more force which leads to increased blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension requires the heart to pump harder. A prolonged increase in pumping power causes the heart to grow in muscle mass. The accumulation of muscle in the heart is called hypertrophy, and it makes the heart pump less efficiently. In atherosclerosis, the partially blocked vessel also reduces the delivery of blood and its vital constituents to the heart. Insufficient oxygen delivery induces a hypoxic environment where cardiac cells become strained. Subsequently, the diminished capacity of the heart endangers other organs of the body. The most worrying situation is when the brain is affected.\n\n(3). As the heart drops in pumping power and blood flow slows, clotting ingredients have more opportunity to interact. The frequent interaction of platelets, clotting factors, and fibrin results in more clots. The most stubborn of these clots travel up the carotid arteries that feed blood to the brain and lodge into a narrow vessel. The blockage of this vessel leads to a phenomenon called ischemia, the inadequate supply of oxygen to an organ or group of cells. An ischemic stroke results from the barricade of a major blood vessel by a clot, lowering blood supply to brain cells. Since the brain tissue lacks pain receptors, the symptoms of a stroke are instead identified by cognitive and physical malfunctions. Therefore, a droopy face, imbalanced arms, and slurred speech are used as primary indicators of a stroke. Strokes are particularly malicious as they often involve damage to brain cells, which often cannot recover from any damage, thus necessitating fast treatment.\n\n(4). There are two main treatment options for an ischemic stroke. The first is tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) which is administered via intravenous fluid to break down the clot. Ideally, TPA is given within 4.5 hours of the initial onset of stroke, and it can restore blood flow to critical brain regions and prevent severe cognitive impairment. However, this method fails when confronted with a large clot. In this case, prompt surgical intervention in the form of endovascular thrombectomy would be required promptly to remove the clot. Once the precise location of the clot is located through a fluorescent dye and contrast imaging, a thin catheter is inserted from the ankle and guided to the spot of the blockage where it extracts the clot. Although the brain can be rescued from an ischemic stroke by decisive intervention, a malfunctioning heart is still portentous.\n\n(5). The plaques that reside in the coronary artery walls become more troublesome over time. The turbulent blood flow in partially blocked vessels can rupture the plaque. The broken off portion of this debris, called the thrombus, can initiate another plaque some distance away. Even worse, the newly exposed surface of the original plaque is highly thrombogenic. Thus, as blood cells arrive and agglutinate to the vacant spot, the plaque grows to a point where it might completely impede the flow of blood to cardiac cells and initiate heart failure.\n\n(6). Heart failure describes a gradual process where cardiac cells begin to die off one by one. The heart has not stopped beating at this point but its ability to pump blood progressively declines due to fewer functional muscle cells. The longer an ischemic event persists, the more severe the heart failure becomes. Once the death of cardiac muscle cells reaches a threshold level, chest pain emerges as one of the earliest indicators of a myocardial infarction or heart attack. Often severe heart attacks caused by arterial blockage can be resolved by angioplasty. This is a surgery where a metal stent that looks like a wiry mesh is inserted into the hardened region of the artery to artificially increase its radius and ease stress on the heart. If a heart attack is not identified in due time, the person’s condition continues to deteriorate. Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart ceases to pump. Once this happens, the rule of thumb is that a 3-minute window separates life and death. The death of heart cells to the point of cardiac arrest is irrevocable and the person would require a heart transplant to live.\n\n(7). It is abundantly clear that cardiac health must be a priority for us all. The process of taking care of one’s heart begins with identifying inborn dispositions. Part of the risk for heart attack depends on the non-modifiable factors of age, gender, and genetics. Older people have a higher tendency to develop plaque within their cardiovascular system because of the cumulative effects of their lifestyle. Keep in mind that by upholding a healthy lifestyle that includes exercise for example, some seniors may circumvent the harmful effects of plaque buildup. Moreover, males experience cardiovascular heart disease earlier and more frequently than women. The body of Research hints that the reason is that men adapt unhealthy coping habits when facing stress.

Once the death of cardiac muscle cells reaches a threshold level, chest pain emerges as one of the earliest indicators of a myocardial infarction or heart attack. Often severe heart attacks caused by arterial blockage can be resolved by angioplasty. This is a surgery where a metal stent that looks like a wiry mesh is inserted into the hardened region of the artery to artificially increase its radius and ease stress on the heart. If a heart attack is not identified in due time, the person’s condition continues to deteriorate. Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart ceases to pump. Once this happens, the rule of thumb is that a 3-minute window separates life and death. The death of heart cells to the point of cardiac arrest is irrevocable and the person would require a heart transplant to live.\n\n(7). It is abundantly clear that cardiac health must be a priority for us all. The process of taking care of one’s heart begins with identifying inborn dispositions. Part of the risk for heart attack depends on the non-modifiable factors of age, gender, and genetics. Older people have a higher tendency to develop plaque within their cardiovascular system because of the cumulative effects of their lifestyle. Keep in mind that by upholding a healthy lifestyle that includes exercise for example, some seniors may circumvent the harmful effects of plaque buildup. Moreover, males experience cardiovascular heart disease earlier and more frequently than women. The body of Research hints that the reason is that men adapt unhealthy coping habits when facing stress. Men are more likely to resort to smoking, alcohol, or unhealthy foods when it comes to dealing with anguish. The inability to accept and cope with one’s emotional turmoil has hazardous physical consequences. It has been proven once again that the advocacy for mental health also affects physical health.\n\n(8). Despite setting the hard limits of our cardiovascular health, the massive role of environmental factors cannot be ignored. The Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation maintains that 80% of heart and stroke diseases are preventable by adopting a balanced diet and a physically active lifestyle. A diet high in fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, reduced-fat dairy products, whole grains, and fish is especially recommended. The effect is seen in improved cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, manageable body weight, and reduced blood sugar. Augmenting such a diet with decreased sodium and saturated fats accentuates the benefits. Furthermore, at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise like raking the leaves, dancing, or playing sports when added to moderate alcohol consumption and tobacco cessation leads to reduced blood pressure and cholesterol. Not only that, but exercise takes care of other risk factors for heart disease by producing better sleep, lower levels of stress, and anti-aging effects. In general, the risk factors that are most associated with heart attack include a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, chronic stress, smoking, alcohol abuse, obesity, and both types of diabetes.\n\n(9). Genetics determines virtually every aspect of the cardiovascular blueprint, from the peculiar shape of capillaries to how the electrical signals are communicated to establish a rhythmic heart rate. If a mutation occurs in a key regulator of cardiac health, it will make a noticeable difference in the prognosis of heart disease. For example, a loss-of-function mutation in the enzyme that processes cholesterol would make it easier for such people to have blocked arteries. But as is the case for many physical ailments, our mind has the power to overcome matter. By employing discipline in everyday choices, you can reap the immeasurable rewards of a healthy heart."

      "concept_text": "The question asks which option most strengthens the author’s stance on the brain’s vulnerability. The author’s stance is identified in paragraph 3: “Strokes are particularly malicious as they often involve damage to brain cells, which often cannot recover from any damage, thus necessitating fast treatment.” The author believes that brain cells are vulnerable because any damage they suffer is often irreversible. The only option that supports this view is Option A, as it confirms how brain cells die quickly and cannot be regenerated. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. The formation of new brain cells can be achieved through exercise – is incorrect because this option implies that there are easily accessible ways of regenerating brain cells, which undermines the view that brain cells are irreplaceable. Option C. Endovascular thrombectomy is developing into a more effective treatment – is incorrect because endovascular thrombectomy is a surgical intervention for strokes. If it were more effective, then there is lower risk of damage to brain cells, which undermines the author’s view that the brain is vulnerable. Option D. Intravenous therapy modalities for stroke can be administered at home – is incorrect because the existence of self-administered therapies would make strokes less of an issue. Individuals would be less likely to have a stroke and suffering damage to brain cells. This suggests that brain damage is unlikely, which opposes the author’s perspective. Option E. Immediate medical attention in the hospital is the only way to treat a stroke – is incorrect because although this option suggests that strokes are dire enough to require hospital access, it is not as strong as option A in portraying the brain’s fragility. Option E implies there are still many treatment options available if given professional facilities.",

      "text": "(1). Every 5 seconds, one person dies of cardiovascular disease and another two come down with a stroke. The World Health Organization recently reported that ischemic heart disease and stroke are the two leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Death due to heart conditions are most prominent in the United States, where 23% of total deaths are attributed to heart issues. One possible explanation for such a high prevalence of heart disease is an unhealthy lifestyle. Cardiovascular complications are a manifestation of both genetic and lifestyle factors, a concoction of nature and nurture.\n\n(2). Cardiovascular disease results from atherosclerosis – the hardening of coronary arteries leading to irregular blood flow to the heart and the rest of the body. Lipids, cholesterol, and dead white blood cells co-agglutinate to form plaque in the arterial wall and decrease the radius of the vessel. In the face of increased resistance, the blood must flow with more force which leads to increased blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension requires the heart to pump harder. A prolonged increase in pumping power causes the heart to grow in muscle mass. The accumulation of muscle in the heart is called hypertrophy, and it makes the heart pump less efficiently. In atherosclerosis, the partially blocked vessel also reduces the delivery of blood and its vital constituents to the heart. Insufficient oxygen delivery induces a hypoxic environment where cardiac cells become strained. Subsequently, the diminished capacity of the heart endangers other organs of the body. The most worrying situation is when the brain is affected.\n\n(3). As the heart drops in pumping power and blood flow slows, clotting ingredients have more opportunity to interact. The frequent interaction of platelets, clotting factors, and fibrin results in more clots. The most stubborn of these clots travel up the carotid arteries that feed blood to the brain and lodge into a narrow vessel. The blockage of this vessel leads to a phenomenon called ischemia, the inadequate supply of oxygen to an organ or group of cells. An ischemic stroke results from the barricade of a major blood vessel by a clot, lowering blood supply to brain cells. Since the brain tissue lacks pain receptors, the symptoms of a stroke are instead identified by cognitive and physical malfunctions. Therefore, a droopy face, imbalanced arms, and slurred speech are used as primary indicators of a stroke. Strokes are particularly malicious as they often involve damage to brain cells, which often cannot recover from any damage, thus necessitating fast treatment.\n\n(4). There are two main treatment options for an ischemic stroke. The first is tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) which is administered via intravenous fluid to break down the clot. Ideally, TPA is given within 4.5 hours of the initial onset of stroke, and it can restore blood flow to critical brain regions and prevent severe cognitive impairment. However, this method fails when confronted with a large clot. In this case, prompt surgical intervention in the form of endovascular thrombectomy would be required promptly to remove the clot. Once the precise location of the clot is located through a fluorescent dye and contrast imaging, a thin catheter is inserted from the ankle and guided to the spot of the blockage where it extracts the clot. Although the brain can be rescued from an ischemic stroke by decisive intervention, a malfunctioning heart is still portentous.\n\n(5). The plaques that reside in the coronary artery walls become more troublesome over time. The turbulent blood flow in partially blocked vessels can rupture the plaque. The broken off portion of this debris, called the thrombus, can initiate another plaque some distance away. Even worse, the newly exposed surface of the original plaque is highly thrombogenic. Thus, as blood cells arrive and agglutinate to the vacant spot, the plaque grows to a point where it might completely impede the flow of blood to cardiac cells and initiate heart failure.\n\n(6). Heart failure describes a gradual process where cardiac cells begin to die off one by one. The heart has not stopped beating at this point but its ability to pump blood progressively declines due to fewer functional muscle cells. The longer an ischemic event persists, the more severe the heart failure becomes. Once the death of cardiac muscle cells reaches a threshold level, chest pain emerges as one of the earliest indicators of a myocardial infarction or heart attack.

However, this method fails when confronted with a large clot. In this case, prompt surgical intervention in the form of endovascular thrombectomy would be required promptly to remove the clot. Once the precise location of the clot is located through a fluorescent dye and contrast imaging, a thin catheter is inserted from the ankle and guided to the spot of the blockage where it extracts the clot. Although the brain can be rescued from an ischemic stroke by decisive intervention, a malfunctioning heart is still portentous.\n\n(5). The plaques that reside in the coronary artery walls become more troublesome over time. The turbulent blood flow in partially blocked vessels can rupture the plaque. The broken off portion of this debris, called the thrombus, can initiate another plaque some distance away. Even worse, the newly exposed surface of the original plaque is highly thrombogenic. Thus, as blood cells arrive and agglutinate to the vacant spot, the plaque grows to a point where it might completely impede the flow of blood to cardiac cells and initiate heart failure.\n\n(6). Heart failure describes a gradual process where cardiac cells begin to die off one by one. The heart has not stopped beating at this point but its ability to pump blood progressively declines due to fewer functional muscle cells. The longer an ischemic event persists, the more severe the heart failure becomes. Once the death of cardiac muscle cells reaches a threshold level, chest pain emerges as one of the earliest indicators of a myocardial infarction or heart attack. Often severe heart attacks caused by arterial blockage can be resolved by angioplasty. This is a surgery where a metal stent that looks like a wiry mesh is inserted into the hardened region of the artery to artificially increase its radius and ease stress on the heart. If a heart attack is not identified in due time, the person’s condition continues to deteriorate. Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart ceases to pump. Once this happens, the rule of thumb is that a 3-minute window separates life and death. The death of heart cells to the point of cardiac arrest is irrevocable and the person would require a heart transplant to live.\n\n(7). It is abundantly clear that cardiac health must be a priority for us all. The process of taking care of one’s heart begins with identifying inborn dispositions. Part of the risk for heart attack depends on the non-modifiable factors of age, gender, and genetics. Older people have a higher tendency to develop plaque within their cardiovascular system because of the cumulative effects of their lifestyle. Keep in mind that by upholding a healthy lifestyle that includes exercise for example, some seniors may circumvent the harmful effects of plaque buildup. Moreover, males experience cardiovascular heart disease earlier and more frequently than women. The body of Research hints that the reason is that men adapt unhealthy coping habits when facing stress. Men are more likely to resort to smoking, alcohol, or unhealthy foods when it comes to dealing with anguish. The inability to accept and cope with one’s emotional turmoil has hazardous physical consequences. It has been proven once again that the advocacy for mental health also affects physical health.\n\n(8). Despite setting the hard limits of our cardiovascular health, the massive role of environmental factors cannot be ignored. The Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation maintains that 80% of heart and stroke diseases are preventable by adopting a balanced diet and a physically active lifestyle. A diet high in fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, reduced-fat dairy products, whole grains, and fish is especially recommended. The effect is seen in improved cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, manageable body weight, and reduced blood sugar. Augmenting such a diet with decreased sodium and saturated fats accentuates the benefits. Furthermore, at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise like raking the leaves, dancing, or playing sports when added to moderate alcohol consumption and tobacco cessation leads to reduced blood pressure and cholesterol. Not only that, but exercise takes care of other risk factors for heart disease by producing better sleep, lower levels of stress, and anti-aging effects. In general, the risk factors that are most associated with heart attack include a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, chronic stress, smoking, alcohol abuse, obesity, and both types of diabetes.\n\n(9). Genetics determines virtually every aspect of the cardiovascular blueprint, from the peculiar shape of capillaries to how the electrical signals are communicated to establish a rhythmic heart rate. If a mutation occurs in a key regulator of cardiac health, it will make a noticeable difference in the prognosis of heart disease. For example, a loss-of-function mutation in the enzyme that processes cholesterol would make it easier for such people to have blocked arteries. But as is the case for many physical ailments, our mind has the power to overcome matter. By employing discipline in everyday choices, you can reap the immeasurable rewards of a healthy heart."

      "text": "(1). Every 5 seconds, one person dies of cardiovascular disease and another two come down with a stroke. The World Health Organization recently reported that ischemic heart disease and stroke are the two leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Death due to heart conditions are most prominent in the United States, where 23% of total deaths are attributed to heart issues. One possible explanation for such a high prevalence of heart disease is an unhealthy lifestyle. Cardiovascular complications are a manifestation of both genetic and lifestyle factors, a concoction of nature and nurture.\n\n(2). Cardiovascular disease results from atherosclerosis – the hardening of coronary arteries leading to irregular blood flow to the heart and the rest of the body. Lipids, cholesterol, and dead white blood cells co-agglutinate to form plaque in the arterial wall and decrease the radius of the vessel. In the face of increased resistance, the blood must flow with more force which leads to increased blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension requires the heart to pump harder. A prolonged increase in pumping power causes the heart to grow in muscle mass. The accumulation of muscle in the heart is called hypertrophy, and it makes the heart pump less efficiently. In atherosclerosis, the partially blocked vessel also reduces the delivery of blood and its vital constituents to the heart. Insufficient oxygen delivery induces a hypoxic environment where cardiac cells become strained. Subsequently, the diminished capacity of the heart endangers other organs of the body. The most worrying situation is when the brain is affected.\n\n(3). As the heart drops in pumping power and blood flow slows, clotting ingredients have more opportunity to interact. The frequent interaction of platelets, clotting factors, and fibrin results in more clots. The most stubborn of these clots travel up the carotid arteries that feed blood to the brain and lodge into a narrow vessel. The blockage of this vessel leads to a phenomenon called ischemia, the inadequate supply of oxygen to an organ or group of cells. An ischemic stroke results from the barricade of a major blood vessel by a clot, lowering blood supply to brain cells. Since the brain tissue lacks pain receptors, the symptoms of a stroke are instead identified by cognitive and physical malfunctions. Therefore, a droopy face, imbalanced arms, and slurred speech are used as primary indicators of a stroke. Strokes are particularly malicious as they often involve damage to brain cells, which often cannot recover from any damage, thus necessitating fast treatment.\n\n(4).

The most worrying situation is when the brain is affected.\n\n(3). As the heart drops in pumping power and blood flow slows, clotting ingredients have more opportunity to interact. The frequent interaction of platelets, clotting factors, and fibrin results in more clots. The most stubborn of these clots travel up the carotid arteries that feed blood to the brain and lodge into a narrow vessel. The blockage of this vessel leads to a phenomenon called ischemia, the inadequate supply of oxygen to an organ or group of cells. An ischemic stroke results from the barricade of a major blood vessel by a clot, lowering blood supply to brain cells. Since the brain tissue lacks pain receptors, the symptoms of a stroke are instead identified by cognitive and physical malfunctions. Therefore, a droopy face, imbalanced arms, and slurred speech are used as primary indicators of a stroke. Strokes are particularly malicious as they often involve damage to brain cells, which often cannot recover from any damage, thus necessitating fast treatment.\n\n(4). There are two main treatment options for an ischemic stroke. The first is tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) which is administered via intravenous fluid to break down the clot. Ideally, TPA is given within 4.5 hours of the initial onset of stroke, and it can restore blood flow to critical brain regions and prevent severe cognitive impairment. However, this method fails when confronted with a large clot. In this case, prompt surgical intervention in the form of endovascular thrombectomy would be required promptly to remove the clot. Once the precise location of the clot is located through a fluorescent dye and contrast imaging, a thin catheter is inserted from the ankle and guided to the spot of the blockage where it extracts the clot. Although the brain can be rescued from an ischemic stroke by decisive intervention, a malfunctioning heart is still portentous.\n\n(5). The plaques that reside in the coronary artery walls become more troublesome over time. The turbulent blood flow in partially blocked vessels can rupture the plaque. The broken off portion of this debris, called the thrombus, can initiate another plaque some distance away. Even worse, the newly exposed surface of the original plaque is highly thrombogenic. Thus, as blood cells arrive and agglutinate to the vacant spot, the plaque grows to a point where it might completely impede the flow of blood to cardiac cells and initiate heart failure.\n\n(6). Heart failure describes a gradual process where cardiac cells begin to die off one by one. The heart has not stopped beating at this point but its ability to pump blood progressively declines due to fewer functional muscle cells. The longer an ischemic event persists, the more severe the heart failure becomes. Once the death of cardiac muscle cells reaches a threshold level, chest pain emerges as one of the earliest indicators of a myocardial infarction or heart attack. Often severe heart attacks caused by arterial blockage can be resolved by angioplasty. This is a surgery where a metal stent that looks like a wiry mesh is inserted into the hardened region of the artery to artificially increase its radius and ease stress on the heart. If a heart attack is not identified in due time, the person’s condition continues to deteriorate. Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart ceases to pump. Once this happens, the rule of thumb is that a 3-minute window separates life and death. The death of heart cells to the point of cardiac arrest is irrevocable and the person would require a heart transplant to live.\n\n(7). It is abundantly clear that cardiac health must be a priority for us all. The process of taking care of one’s heart begins with identifying inborn dispositions. Part of the risk for heart attack depends on the non-modifiable factors of age, gender, and genetics. Older people have a higher tendency to develop plaque within their cardiovascular system because of the cumulative effects of their lifestyle. Keep in mind that by upholding a healthy lifestyle that includes exercise for example, some seniors may circumvent the harmful effects of plaque buildup. Moreover, males experience cardiovascular heart disease earlier and more frequently than women. The body of Research hints that the reason is that men adapt unhealthy coping habits when facing stress. Men are more likely to resort to smoking, alcohol, or unhealthy foods when it comes to dealing with anguish. The inability to accept and cope with one’s emotional turmoil has hazardous physical consequences. It has been proven once again that the advocacy for mental health also affects physical health.\n\n(8). Despite setting the hard limits of our cardiovascular health, the massive role of environmental factors cannot be ignored. The Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation maintains that 80% of heart and stroke diseases are preventable by adopting a balanced diet and a physically active lifestyle. A diet high in fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, reduced-fat dairy products, whole grains, and fish is especially recommended. The effect is seen in improved cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, manageable body weight, and reduced blood sugar. Augmenting such a diet with decreased sodium and saturated fats accentuates the benefits. Furthermore, at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise like raking the leaves, dancing, or playing sports when added to moderate alcohol consumption and tobacco cessation leads to reduced blood pressure and cholesterol. Not only that, but exercise takes care of other risk factors for heart disease by producing better sleep, lower levels of stress, and anti-aging effects. In general, the risk factors that are most associated with heart attack include a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, chronic stress, smoking, alcohol abuse, obesity, and both types of diabetes.\n\n(9). Genetics determines virtually every aspect of the cardiovascular blueprint, from the peculiar shape of capillaries to how the electrical signals are communicated to establish a rhythmic heart rate. If a mutation occurs in a key regulator of cardiac health, it will make a noticeable difference in the prognosis of heart disease. For example, a loss-of-function mutation in the enzyme that processes cholesterol would make it easier for such people to have blocked arteries. But as is the case for many physical ailments, our mind has the power to overcome matter. By employing discipline in everyday choices, you can reap the immeasurable rewards of a healthy heart."

      "text": "(1). Every 5 seconds, one person dies of cardiovascular disease and another two come down with a stroke. The World Health Organization recently reported that ischemic heart disease and stroke are the two leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Death due to heart conditions are most prominent in the United States, where 23% of total deaths are attributed to heart issues. One possible explanation for such a high prevalence of heart disease is an unhealthy lifestyle. Cardiovascular complications are a manifestation of both genetic and lifestyle factors, a concoction of nature and nurture.\n\n(2). Cardiovascular disease results from atherosclerosis – the hardening of coronary arteries leading to irregular blood flow to the heart and the rest of the body. Lipids, cholesterol, and dead white blood cells co-agglutinate to form plaque in the arterial wall and decrease the radius of the vessel. In the face of increased resistance, the blood must flow with more force which leads to increased blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension requires the heart to pump harder. A prolonged increase in pumping power causes the heart to grow in muscle mass. The accumulation of muscle in the heart is called hypertrophy, and it makes the heart pump less efficiently. In atherosclerosis, the partially blocked vessel also reduces the delivery of blood and its vital constituents to the heart.

      "text": "(1). For most of history, doctors have relied on superficial descriptions of symptoms to diagnose disease. However, at the turn of the 20 th century, advances in physics brought new tools into the medical field that have given doctors a window into how the body functions. These tools have included: x-rays, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine.\n\n(2). X-ray is the oldest form of medical imaging. It uses electromagnetic radiation in the x-ray spectrum to create 2D images of internal structures. Before understanding how x-rays work, the behavior of electrons must be understood. On an atomic level, electrons with differing energy levels orbit an atom. The electrons can move to a higher energy level if they absorb a packet of energy, called a photon. This photon has a discrete amount of energy, which corresponds to the distance it needs to jump to reach a higher orbital. On the other hand, if the electron loses energy, it will emit a photon with a discrete amount of energy which corresponds to the distance it jumped to reach a lower orbital. If the discrete amount of energy in a photon does not equal the energy needs of the electron that it collides with, the photon will not be absorbed by the atom.\n\n(3). X-ray photons have too much energy to be absorbed by most of the atoms in the human body. That means that they pass right through our soft tissue and organs. However, x-ray photons have energy levels that correspond with the electron orbitals in bone tissue and many types of metal. This means that, while they are absorbed by bone tissue, they pass through soft tissue and thus create a shadow image of the bone’s structure on x-ray film.\n\n(4). An x-ray machine consists of a tube with a tungsten anode and a heat-filament cathode. There is a high voltage difference between the anode and the cathode, which causes electrons to fly between them. When the electrons hit the tungsten atoms, they knock an electron into a lower orbital. This emits a high-energy photon which is in the x-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The machine is surrounded by a thick piece of lead to keep the x-rays from scattering and has a small opening where a beam of x-ray photons is directed out. This beam is focused at a patient’s targeted area, and a film is placed facing the x-ray, thus recording the pattern of photons that pass through the soft tissues.\n\n(5). With the use of fluoroscopy (a three-dimensional modified x-ray imaging technique), doctors can look at softer tissues such as blood vessels and the gastrointestinal tract. To do this, the patient first must ingest a radiocontrast agent, most often a barium compound or iodine, which is absorbed into key issues. This causes the atoms of those tissues to absorb the x-rays, making them visible on a fluorescent screen, which records a moving image. Doctors can then track the movement of the radiocontrast agent as it moves through the body.\n\n(6). Computerized axial tomography, more commonly known as a CT or CAT scan, uses x-ray technology to create a 3D image of a patient’s internal structures along the axial plane. To create the image, a patient is moved through an x-ray tube with a revolving ring that is outfitted with x-ray beams and detectors. As the patient moves through the tube, the ring takes x-ray images from many different angles. The images are then rendered by a computer, which puts together a 3D model from each scan. This type of scan can give doctors a quick and finely detailed look at many different areas of the body. Therefore, it is the first choice for doctors in diagnosing emergency conditions such as cerebral trauma, appendicitis, kidney stones, and blockages in the arteries.\n\n(7). Not only do doctors use electromagnetic waves to see inside of the body, but they also harness sound waves to create images of internal structures. An ultrasound is one of the technologies to use this technique by sending sound waves through a targeted area. The main part of an ultrasound machine consists of a transducer probe. This probe contains one or more quartz crystals called piezoelectric crystals. These crystals change shape rapidly whenever an electric current is applied. The vibrations then travel outwardly as sound waves. When the crystals are in turn hit by a sound wave, they emit an electrical current. This allows them to be used to send, as well as receive, sound wave information. As the sound waves travel through different tissues in the body, they travel at different speeds. When the sound wave hits a border between two different types of tissue, some of the waves reflect and are directed back toward the probe. When they return to the probe, information regarding the distance and speed of travel for each sound wave is recorded, and a computer then compiles a 2D image.\n\n(8). In recent years, doppler ultrasound imaging has become available for creating 3D images. It uses the same type of probe as an ultrasound, but it creates an image with moving or rotating probes, and it then applies the concept of the doppler effect. The Doppler effect refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for an observer, who is moving relative to the wave source. That means that when a sound wave echoes back to the probe, the wave frequency will change based on the direction and the speed at which it is moving. A Doppler ultrasound then measures the change in frequency of the echoes to calculate how fast an object is moving. The computer can then create a 3D image with this technology. This technology is considered safe, and it is therefore used frequently for observing fetal progression in pregnant women. It is also frequently used for assessing blood clotting and internal bleeding in trauma wards.\n\n(9). Furthermore, MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, uses magnetism to produce detailed pictures of the inside of the body. It is a significant tool used in hospitals for detailed pictures of organs, soft tissues, bone, and virtually all other internal body structures. To use this machine, a patient is rolled inside a tube that is surrounded by a giant superconductive magnet. The magnet consists of a large, electrified wire coil that produces 2.0 teslas of magnetism. That is four times the power of the Earth’s magnetic field! Normally, this machine would require a lot of energy to run, but energy costs are brought down by lowering the resistance within the wires. This is achieved by bathing the wires in liquid helium kept at 269.1 degrees Celsius below zero. The whole system is then insulated inside of a vacuum.\n\n(10). An MRI machine works by creating a strong magnetic field that acts on the plentiful hydrogen molecules inside of the body. At any moment, each hydrogen molecule inside of a person is spinning along its axis in various directions. When placed in a strong magnetic field, the atoms have a strong magnetic moment. This means that they line up in the direction of the field.\n\n(11). A radio signal then disturbs the nucleus's axis of rotation and records the frequency signal that is produced when the nucleus goes back to its baseline state. The coils then pick up this signal and send it to the computer system. Based on the frequencies, the computer can then create a 2D or 3D layout of the different tissue types. The advantages of this technique are that you can create images of soft tissues along the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. There are also some major disadvantages, such as the equipment cost for doctors to buy and patients to use. Patients must also stay extremely still for up to 1.5 hours as any movement can distort the image quality. Individuals with any metal in their body, for example, a pacemaker or dental implants cannot enter the machine due to the strong magnetic force.\n\n(12). Lastly, positron emission tomography, or PET scans, are a type of nuclear medicine imaging. Instead of passing radiation through a patient’s tissues, this type of scan records radiation that comes from within the body. To create radiation within the body, a tracer substance is injected into the peripheral veins. The tracer is picked up by the targeted organ and the substance undergoes a process called positive beta decay. During this decay, a proton inside the nucleus of the tracer atom is converted into a neutron, and a positron, or the antiparticle of an electron, is released. After the positron travels a short distance, it loses its kinetic energy and will annihilate any electron that it encounters. The energy from this annihilation sends out gamma radiation, which is a beam of high-energy photons. These gamma rays are detected by the PET scanner and are then used to map organs and tissues on a computer. The PET scanner is often used to look at physiological functions, such as the excretory function of the kidneys or the rate of blood flow to the heart.\n\n(13). In the past century, advances in medical imaging have allowed doctors to learn about the progressions of diseases and better diagnose patients. As time passes on, advancements are being made in medical imaging that continually decrease the cost and increase the imaging quality. Just imagine what the next hundred years will bring!"

The radiocontrast agent causes the atoms of the key tissues mentioned to absorb the x-rays, making them visible on a fluorescent screen…doctors can then track the movement of the radiocontrast agent as it moves through the body.” This tells us that an advantage of fluoroscopy is its ability to track motion within the body.

      "text": "(1). For most of history, doctors have relied on superficial descriptions of symptoms to diagnose disease. However, at the turn of the 20 th century, advances in physics brought new tools into the medical field that have given doctors a window into how the body functions. These tools have included: x-rays, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine.\n\n(2). X-ray is the oldest form of medical imaging. It uses electromagnetic radiation in the x-ray spectrum to create 2D images of internal structures. Before understanding how x-rays work, the behavior of electrons must be understood. On an atomic level, electrons with differing energy levels orbit an atom. The electrons can move to a higher energy level if they absorb a packet of energy, called a photon. This photon has a discrete amount of energy, which corresponds to the distance it needs to jump to reach a higher orbital. On the other hand, if the electron loses energy, it will emit a photon with a discrete amount of energy which corresponds to the distance it jumped to reach a lower orbital. If the discrete amount of energy in a photon does not equal the energy needs of the electron that it collides with, the photon will not be absorbed by the atom.\n\n(3). X-ray photons have too much energy to be absorbed by most of the atoms in the human body. That means that they pass right through our soft tissue and organs. However, x-ray photons have energy levels that correspond with the electron orbitals in bone tissue and many types of metal. This means that, while they are absorbed by bone tissue, they pass through soft tissue and thus create a shadow image of the bone’s structure on x-ray film.\n\n(4). An x-ray machine consists of a tube with a tungsten anode and a heat-filament cathode. There is a high voltage difference between the anode and the cathode, which causes electrons to fly between them. When the electrons hit the tungsten atoms, they knock an electron into a lower orbital. This emits a high-energy photon which is in the x-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The machine is surrounded by a thick piece of lead to keep the x-rays from scattering and has a small opening where a beam of x-ray photons is directed out. This beam is focused at a patient’s targeted area, and a film is placed facing the x-ray, thus recording the pattern of photons that pass through the soft tissues.\n\n(5). With the use of fluoroscopy (a three-dimensional modified x-ray imaging technique), doctors can look at softer tissues such as blood vessels and the gastrointestinal tract. To do this, the patient first must ingest a radiocontrast agent, most often a barium compound or iodine, which is absorbed into key issues. This causes the atoms of those tissues to absorb the x-rays, making them visible on a fluorescent screen, which records a moving image. Doctors can then track the movement of the radiocontrast agent as it moves through the body.\n\n(6). Computerized axial tomography, more commonly known as a CT or CAT scan, uses x-ray technology to create a 3D image of a patient’s internal structures along the axial plane. To create the image, a patient is moved through an x-ray tube with a revolving ring that is outfitted with x-ray beams and detectors. As the patient moves through the tube, the ring takes x-ray images from many different angles. The images are then rendered by a computer, which puts together a 3D model from each scan. This type of scan can give doctors a quick and finely detailed look at many different areas of the body. Therefore, it is the first choice for doctors in diagnosing emergency conditions such as cerebral trauma, appendicitis, kidney stones, and blockages in the arteries.\n\n(7). Not only do doctors use electromagnetic waves to see inside of the body, but they also harness sound waves to create images of internal structures. An ultrasound is one of the technologies to use this technique by sending sound waves through a targeted area. The main part of an ultrasound machine consists of a transducer probe. This probe contains one or more quartz crystals called piezoelectric crystals. These crystals change shape rapidly whenever an electric current is applied. The vibrations then travel outwardly as sound waves. When the crystals are in turn hit by a sound wave, they emit an electrical current. This allows them to be used to send, as well as receive, sound wave information. As the sound waves travel through different tissues in the body, they travel at different speeds. When the sound wave hits a border between two different types of tissue, some of the waves reflect and are directed back toward the probe. When they return to the probe, information regarding the distance and speed of travel for each sound wave is recorded, and a computer then compiles a 2D image.\n\n(8). In recent years, doppler ultrasound imaging has become available for creating 3D images. It uses the same type of probe as an ultrasound, but it creates an image with moving or rotating probes, and it then applies the concept of the doppler effect. The Doppler effect refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for an observer, who is moving relative to the wave source. That means that when a sound wave echoes back to the probe, the wave frequency will change based on the direction and the speed at which it is moving. A Doppler ultrasound then measures the change in frequency of the echoes to calculate how fast an object is moving. The computer can then create a 3D image with this technology. This technology is considered safe, and it is therefore used frequently for observing fetal progression in pregnant women. It is also frequently used for assessing blood clotting and internal bleeding in trauma wards.\n\n(9). Furthermore, MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, uses magnetism to produce detailed pictures of the inside of the body. It is a significant tool used in hospitals for detailed pictures of organs, soft tissues, bone, and virtually all other internal body structures. To use this machine, a patient is rolled inside a tube that is surrounded by a giant superconductive magnet. The magnet consists of a large, electrified wire coil that produces 2.0 teslas of magnetism. That is four times the power of the Earth’s magnetic field! Normally, this machine would require a lot of energy to run, but energy costs are brought down by lowering the resistance within the wires. This is achieved by bathing the wires in liquid helium kept at 269.1 degrees Celsius below zero. The whole system is then insulated inside of a vacuum.\n\n(10). An MRI machine works by creating a strong magnetic field that acts on the plentiful hydrogen molecules inside of the body. At any moment, each hydrogen molecule inside of a person is spinning along its axis in various directions. When placed in a strong magnetic field, the atoms have a strong magnetic moment. This means that they line up in the direction of the field.\n\n(11). A radio signal then disturbs the nucleus's axis of rotation and records the frequency signal that is produced when the nucleus goes back to its baseline state. The coils then pick up this signal and send it to the computer system. Based on the frequencies, the computer can then create a 2D or 3D layout of the different tissue types. The advantages of this technique are that you can create images of soft tissues along the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. There are also some major disadvantages, such as the equipment cost for doctors to buy and patients to use. Patients must also stay extremely still for up to 1.5 hours as any movement can distort the image quality. Individuals with any metal in their body, for example, a pacemaker or dental implants cannot enter the machine due to the strong magnetic force.\n\n(12). Lastly, positron emission tomography, or PET scans, are a type of nuclear medicine imaging. Instead of passing radiation through a patient’s tissues, this type of scan records radiation that comes from within the body. To create radiation within the body, a tracer substance is injected into the peripheral veins. The tracer is picked up by the targeted organ and the substance undergoes a process called positive beta decay. During this decay, a proton inside the nucleus of the tracer atom is converted into a neutron, and a positron, or the antiparticle of an electron, is released. After the positron travels a short distance, it loses its kinetic energy and will annihilate any electron that it encounters. The energy from this annihilation sends out gamma radiation, which is a beam of high-energy photons. These gamma rays are detected by the PET scanner and are then used to map organs and tissues on a computer. The PET scanner is often used to look at physiological functions, such as the excretory function of the kidneys or the rate of blood flow to the heart.\n\n(13). In the past century, advances in medical imaging have allowed doctors to learn about the progressions of diseases and better diagnose patients. As time passes on, advancements are being made in medical imaging that continually decrease the cost and increase the imaging quality. Just imagine what the next hundred years will bring!"

As the patient moves through the tube, the ring takes x-ray images from many different angles. The images are then rendered by a computer, which puts together a 3D model from each scan. This type of scan can give doctors a quick and finely detailed look at many different areas of the body. Therefore, it is the first choice for doctors in diagnosing emergency conditions such as cerebral trauma, appendicitis, kidney stones, and blockages in the arteries.\n\n(7). Not only do doctors use electromagnetic waves to see inside of the body, but they also harness sound waves to create images of internal structures. An ultrasound is one of the technologies to use this technique by sending sound waves through a targeted area. The main part of an ultrasound machine consists of a transducer probe. This probe contains one or more quartz crystals called piezoelectric crystals. These crystals change shape rapidly whenever an electric current is applied. The vibrations then travel outwardly as sound waves. When the crystals are in turn hit by a sound wave, they emit an electrical current. This allows them to be used to send, as well as receive, sound wave information. As the sound waves travel through different tissues in the body, they travel at different speeds. When the sound wave hits a border between two different types of tissue, some of the waves reflect and are directed back toward the probe. When they return to the probe, information regarding the distance and speed of travel for each sound wave is recorded, and a computer then compiles a 2D image.\n\n(8). In recent years, doppler ultrasound imaging has become available for creating 3D images. It uses the same type of probe as an ultrasound, but it creates an image with moving or rotating probes, and it then applies the concept of the doppler effect. The Doppler effect refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for an observer, who is moving relative to the wave source. That means that when a sound wave echoes back to the probe, the wave frequency will change based on the direction and the speed at which it is moving. A Doppler ultrasound then measures the change in frequency of the echoes to calculate how fast an object is moving. The computer can then create a 3D image with this technology. This technology is considered safe, and it is therefore used frequently for observing fetal progression in pregnant women. It is also frequently used for assessing blood clotting and internal bleeding in trauma wards.\n\n(9). Furthermore, MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, uses magnetism to produce detailed pictures of the inside of the body. It is a significant tool used in hospitals for detailed pictures of organs, soft tissues, bone, and virtually all other internal body structures. To use this machine, a patient is rolled inside a tube that is surrounded by a giant superconductive magnet. The magnet consists of a large, electrified wire coil that produces 2.0 teslas of magnetism. That is four times the power of the Earth’s magnetic field! Normally, this machine would require a lot of energy to run, but energy costs are brought down by lowering the resistance within the wires. This is achieved by bathing the wires in liquid helium kept at 269.1 degrees Celsius below zero. The whole system is then insulated inside of a vacuum.\n\n(10). An MRI machine works by creating a strong magnetic field that acts on the plentiful hydrogen molecules inside of the body. At any moment, each hydrogen molecule inside of a person is spinning along its axis in various directions. When placed in a strong magnetic field, the atoms have a strong magnetic moment. This means that they line up in the direction of the field.\n\n(11). A radio signal then disturbs the nucleus's axis of rotation and records the frequency signal that is produced when the nucleus goes back to its baseline state. The coils then pick up this signal and send it to the computer system. Based on the frequencies, the computer can then create a 2D or 3D layout of the different tissue types. The advantages of this technique are that you can create images of soft tissues along the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. There are also some major disadvantages, such as the equipment cost for doctors to buy and patients to use. Patients must also stay extremely still for up to 1.5 hours as any movement can distort the image quality. Individuals with any metal in their body, for example, a pacemaker or dental implants cannot enter the machine due to the strong magnetic force.\n\n(12). Lastly, positron emission tomography, or PET scans, are a type of nuclear medicine imaging. Instead of passing radiation through a patient’s tissues, this type of scan records radiation that comes from within the body. To create radiation within the body, a tracer substance is injected into the peripheral veins. The tracer is picked up by the targeted organ and the substance undergoes a process called positive beta decay. During this decay, a proton inside the nucleus of the tracer atom is converted into a neutron, and a positron, or the antiparticle of an electron, is released. After the positron travels a short distance, it loses its kinetic energy and will annihilate any electron that it encounters. The energy from this annihilation sends out gamma radiation, which is a beam of high-energy photons. These gamma rays are detected by the PET scanner and are then used to map organs and tissues on a computer. The PET scanner is often used to look at physiological functions, such as the excretory function of the kidneys or the rate of blood flow to the heart.\n\n(13). In the past century, advances in medical imaging have allowed doctors to learn about the progressions of diseases and better diagnose patients. As time passes on, advancements are being made in medical imaging that continually decrease the cost and increase the imaging quality. Just imagine what the next hundred years will bring!"

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should first define each of the option choices. Sarcasm means irony or mocking, informational means providing useful facts, reflective means contemplative, excitement means enthusiasm, and uncertainty means doubt. Next, we should consider the author’s tone in the text and match it to one of the above definitions. Paragraph 13 reads: “As time passes, advancements are being made in medical imaging that continually bring down cost, as well as improve the quality of the medical imaging itself. Now just imagine what the next hundred years will bring!” We can say that the author does NOT use sarcasm when discussing advancements in medical imaging, NOR is the author contemplating the topic and being reflective. The author does NOT express doubt in the paragraph, so we can conclude that they are not uncertain. Lastly, the author emphasizes their own opinion over providing information or facts in the paragraph. By talking about advancements in medical imaging and asking the reader to imagine what technology will become available in the next one hundred years, the author is expressing excitement about the future. Thus, we can say that the author’s tone conveys excitement. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Sarcastic – is incorrect because a sarcastic tone would mean that the author uses irony or mocks individuals. This is not the case as the author cannot wait to see developments in medical imaging technology; thus, this is incorrect. Option B. Informational – is incorrect because, while this may seem correct, the author expresses excitement about future developments in medical imaging. Hence, their tone is not purely informational but also expresses their personal viewpoint; thus, this is incorrect. Option C. Reflective – is incorrect because reflective would mean that the author is contemplating and thinking about medical imaging technologies; this is not the case as the author expresses excitement about the future developments of this technology and does not discuss its past, at least in the context of paragraph 13. Option E. Uncertain – is incorrect because, while this may seem correct, the author expresses excitement about the future developments of medical imaging technology; this is not the same as feeling uncertain; thus, this is incorrect.",

      "text": "(1). For most of history, doctors have relied on superficial descriptions of symptoms to diagnose disease. However, at the turn of the 20 th century, advances in physics brought new tools into the medical field that have given doctors a window into how the body functions. These tools have included: x-rays, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine.\n\n(2). X-ray is the oldest form of medical imaging. It uses electromagnetic radiation in the x-ray spectrum to create 2D images of internal structures. Before understanding how x-rays work, the behavior of electrons must be understood. On an atomic level, electrons with differing energy levels orbit an atom. The electrons can move to a higher energy level if they absorb a packet of energy, called a photon. This photon has a discrete amount of energy, which corresponds to the distance it needs to jump to reach a higher orbital. On the other hand, if the electron loses energy, it will emit a photon with a discrete amount of energy which corresponds to the distance it jumped to reach a lower orbital. If the discrete amount of energy in a photon does not equal the energy needs of the electron that it collides with, the photon will not be absorbed by the atom.\n\n(3). X-ray photons have too much energy to be absorbed by most of the atoms in the human body. That means that they pass right through our soft tissue and organs. However, x-ray photons have energy levels that correspond with the electron orbitals in bone tissue and many types of metal. This means that, while they are absorbed by bone tissue, they pass through soft tissue and thus create a shadow image of the bone’s structure on x-ray film.\n\n(4). An x-ray machine consists of a tube with a tungsten anode and a heat-filament cathode. There is a high voltage difference between the anode and the cathode, which causes electrons to fly between them. When the electrons hit the tungsten atoms, they knock an electron into a lower orbital. This emits a high-energy photon which is in the x-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The machine is surrounded by a thick piece of lead to keep the x-rays from scattering and has a small opening where a beam of x-ray photons is directed out. This beam is focused at a patient’s targeted area, and a film is placed facing the x-ray, thus recording the pattern of photons that pass through the soft tissues.\n\n(5). With the use of fluoroscopy (a three-dimensional modified x-ray imaging technique), doctors can look at softer tissues such as blood vessels and the gastrointestinal tract. To do this, the patient first must ingest a radiocontrast agent, most often a barium compound or iodine, which is absorbed into key issues. This causes the atoms of those tissues to absorb the x-rays, making them visible on a fluorescent screen, which records a moving image. Doctors can then track the movement of the radiocontrast agent as it moves through the body.\n\n(6). Computerized axial tomography, more commonly known as a CT or CAT scan, uses x-ray technology to create a 3D image of a patient’s internal structures along the axial plane. To create the image, a patient is moved through an x-ray tube with a revolving ring that is outfitted with x-ray beams and detectors.

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, note that the question and reason in the stem relate to the same subtopic of the passage (Dopplers). Thus, it can be presumed that the information needed to ascertain the veracity and relatedness of both the statement and reason will be found in the same section of the passage. Doppler ultrasounds are mentioned in paragraph 8. The author mentions the statement below in paragraph 8. This tells us that Doppler ultrasounds DO create 3D images and that this is accomplished using a probe moving relative to a soundwave. It reads: “In recent years, doppler ultrasound imaging has become an available resource for creating 3D images. It uses the same type of probe as an ultrasound, but it creates an image with moving or rotating probes, then applies the concept of the doppler effect (the doppler effect refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for an observer who is moving relative to the wave source).” Thus, both the statement and the reason are correct and related. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Both the statement and reason are correct and related – is incorrect because the statement and reason are related; it is because of the Doppler effect, which measures the frequency of a sound wave change, that the Doppler ultrasound can create 3D images (this is proven through a close reading of paragraph 8). Option C. The statement is correct, but the reason is NOT – is incorrect because the reason is also correct. The Doppler effect works by measuring the “change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for an observer who is moving relative to the wave source.” Option D. The statement is NOT correct, but the reason is correct – is incorrect because the statement is also correct. In paragraph 8, the author says that “doppler ultrasound imaging has become an available resource for creating 3D images.” It is because of the Doppler effect that the Doppler ultrasound can create 3D images. Option E. NEITHER the statement NOR the reason is correct – is incorrect because both the statement and reason are correct. In paragraph 8, the author says that “Doppler ultrasound imaging has become an available resource for creating 3D images,” which proves the statement correct.

      "text": "(1). For most of history, doctors have relied on superficial descriptions of symptoms to diagnose disease. However, at the turn of the 20 th century, advances in physics brought new tools into the medical field that have given doctors a window into how the body functions. These tools have included: x-rays, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine.\n\n(2). X-ray is the oldest form of medical imaging. It uses electromagnetic radiation in the x-ray spectrum to create 2D images of internal structures. Before understanding how x-rays work, the behavior of electrons must be understood. On an atomic level, electrons with differing energy levels orbit an atom. The electrons can move to a higher energy level if they absorb a packet of energy, called a photon. This photon has a discrete amount of energy, which corresponds to the distance it needs to jump to reach a higher orbital. On the other hand, if the electron loses energy, it will emit a photon with a discrete amount of energy which corresponds to the distance it jumped to reach a lower orbital. If the discrete amount of energy in a photon does not equal the energy needs of the electron that it collides with, the photon will not be absorbed by the atom.\n\n(3). X-ray photons have too much energy to be absorbed by most of the atoms in the human body. That means that they pass right through our soft tissue and organs. However, x-ray photons have energy levels that correspond with the electron orbitals in bone tissue and many types of metal. This means that, while they are absorbed by bone tissue, they pass through soft tissue and thus create a shadow image of the bone’s structure on x-ray film.\n\n(4). An x-ray machine consists of a tube with a tungsten anode and a heat-filament cathode. There is a high voltage difference between the anode and the cathode, which causes electrons to fly between them. When the electrons hit the tungsten atoms, they knock an electron into a lower orbital. This emits a high-energy photon which is in the x-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The machine is surrounded by a thick piece of lead to keep the x-rays from scattering and has a small opening where a beam of x-ray photons is directed out. This beam is focused at a patient’s targeted area, and a film is placed facing the x-ray, thus recording the pattern of photons that pass through the soft tissues.\n\n(5). With the use of fluoroscopy (a three-dimensional modified x-ray imaging technique), doctors can look at softer tissues such as blood vessels and the gastrointestinal tract. To do this, the patient first must ingest a radiocontrast agent, most often a barium compound or iodine, which is absorbed into key issues. This causes the atoms of those tissues to absorb the x-rays, making them visible on a fluorescent screen, which records a moving image. Doctors can then track the movement of the radiocontrast agent as it moves through the body.\n\n(6). Computerized axial tomography, more commonly known as a CT or CAT scan, uses x-ray technology to create a 3D image of a patient’s internal structures along the axial plane. To create the image, a patient is moved through an x-ray tube with a revolving ring that is outfitted with x-ray beams and detectors. As the patient moves through the tube, the ring takes x-ray images from many different angles. The images are then rendered by a computer, which puts together a 3D model from each scan. This type of scan can give doctors a quick and finely detailed look at many different areas of the body. Therefore, it is the first choice for doctors in diagnosing emergency conditions such as cerebral trauma, appendicitis, kidney stones, and blockages in the arteries.\n\n(7). Not only do doctors use electromagnetic waves to see inside of the body, but they also harness sound waves to create images of internal structures. An ultrasound is one of the technologies to use this technique by sending sound waves through a targeted area. The main part of an ultrasound machine consists of a transducer probe. This probe contains one or more quartz crystals called piezoelectric crystals. These crystals change shape rapidly whenever an electric current is applied. The vibrations then travel outwardly as sound waves. When the crystals are in turn hit by a sound wave, they emit an electrical current. This allows them to be used to send, as well as receive, sound wave information. As the sound waves travel through different tissues in the body, they travel at different speeds. When the sound wave hits a border between two different types of tissue, some of the waves reflect and are directed back toward the probe. When they return to the probe, information regarding the distance and speed of travel for each sound wave is recorded, and a computer then compiles a 2D image.\n\n(8). In recent years, doppler ultrasound imaging has become available for creating 3D images. It uses the same type of probe as an ultrasound, but it creates an image with moving or rotating probes, and it then applies the concept of the doppler effect. The Doppler effect refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for an observer, who is moving relative to the wave source. That means that when a sound wave echoes back to the probe, the wave frequency will change based on the direction and the speed at which it is moving. A Doppler ultrasound then measures the change in frequency of the echoes to calculate how fast an object is moving. The computer can then create a 3D image with this technology. This technology is considered safe, and it is therefore used frequently for observing fetal progression in pregnant women. It is also frequently used for assessing blood clotting and internal bleeding in trauma wards.\n\n(9). Furthermore, MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, uses magnetism to produce detailed pictures of the inside of the body. It is a significant tool used in hospitals for detailed pictures of organs, soft tissues, bone, and virtually all other internal body structures. To use this machine, a patient is rolled inside a tube that is surrounded by a giant superconductive magnet. The magnet consists of a large, electrified wire coil that produces 2.0 teslas of magnetism. That is four times the power of the Earth’s magnetic field! Normally, this machine would require a lot of energy to run, but energy costs are brought down by lowering the resistance within the wires. This is achieved by bathing the wires in liquid helium kept at 269.1 degrees Celsius below zero. The whole system is then insulated inside of a vacuum.\n\n(10). An MRI machine works by creating a strong magnetic field that acts on the plentiful hydrogen molecules inside of the body. At any moment, each hydrogen molecule inside of a person is spinning along its axis in various directions. When placed in a strong magnetic field, the atoms have a strong magnetic moment. This means that they line up in the direction of the field.\n\n(11). A radio signal then disturbs the nucleus's axis of rotation and records the frequency signal that is produced when the nucleus goes back to its baseline state. The coils then pick up this signal and send it to the computer system. Based on the frequencies, the computer can then create a 2D or 3D layout of the different tissue types. The advantages of this technique are that you can create images of soft tissues along the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. There are also some major disadvantages, such as the equipment cost for doctors to buy and patients to use. Patients must also stay extremely still for up to 1.5 hours as any movement can distort the image quality. Individuals with any metal in their body, for example, a pacemaker or dental implants cannot enter the machine due to the strong magnetic force.\n\n(12). Lastly, positron emission tomography, or PET scans, are a type of nuclear medicine imaging. Instead of passing radiation through a patient’s tissues, this type of scan records radiation that comes from within the body. To create radiation within the body, a tracer substance is injected into the peripheral veins. The tracer is picked up by the targeted organ and the substance undergoes a process called positive beta decay. During this decay, a proton inside the nucleus of the tracer atom is converted into a neutron, and a positron, or the antiparticle of an electron, is released. After the positron travels a short distance, it loses its kinetic energy and will annihilate any electron that it encounters. The energy from this annihilation sends out gamma radiation, which is a beam of high-energy photons. These gamma rays are detected by the PET scanner and are then used to map organs and tissues on a computer. The PET scanner is often used to look at physiological functions, such as the excretory function of the kidneys or the rate of blood flow to the heart.\n\n(13). In the past century, advances in medical imaging have allowed doctors to learn about the progressions of diseases and better diagnose patients. As time passes on, advancements are being made in medical imaging that continually decrease the cost and increase the imaging quality. Just imagine what the next hundred years will bring!"

This means that, while they are absorbed by bone tissue, they pass through soft tissue and thus create a shadow image of the bone’s structure on x-ray film.\n\n(4). An x-ray machine consists of a tube with a tungsten anode and a heat-filament cathode. There is a high voltage difference between the anode and the cathode, which causes electrons to fly between them. When the electrons hit the tungsten atoms, they knock an electron into a lower orbital. This emits a high-energy photon which is in the x-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The machine is surrounded by a thick piece of lead to keep the x-rays from scattering and has a small opening where a beam of x-ray photons is directed out. This beam is focused at a patient’s targeted area, and a film is placed facing the x-ray, thus recording the pattern of photons that pass through the soft tissues.\n\n(5). With the use of fluoroscopy (a three-dimensional modified x-ray imaging technique), doctors can look at softer tissues such as blood vessels and the gastrointestinal tract. To do this, the patient first must ingest a radiocontrast agent, most often a barium compound or iodine, which is absorbed into key issues. This causes the atoms of those tissues to absorb the x-rays, making them visible on a fluorescent screen, which records a moving image. Doctors can then track the movement of the radiocontrast agent as it moves through the body.\n\n(6). Computerized axial tomography, more commonly known as a CT or CAT scan, uses x-ray technology to create a 3D image of a patient’s internal structures along the axial plane. To create the image, a patient is moved through an x-ray tube with a revolving ring that is outfitted with x-ray beams and detectors. As the patient moves through the tube, the ring takes x-ray images from many different angles. The images are then rendered by a computer, which puts together a 3D model from each scan. This type of scan can give doctors a quick and finely detailed look at many different areas of the body. Therefore, it is the first choice for doctors in diagnosing emergency conditions such as cerebral trauma, appendicitis, kidney stones, and blockages in the arteries.\n\n(7). Not only do doctors use electromagnetic waves to see inside of the body, but they also harness sound waves to create images of internal structures. An ultrasound is one of the technologies to use this technique by sending sound waves through a targeted area. The main part of an ultrasound machine consists of a transducer probe. This probe contains one or more quartz crystals called piezoelectric crystals. These crystals change shape rapidly whenever an electric current is applied. The vibrations then travel outwardly as sound waves. When the crystals are in turn hit by a sound wave, they emit an electrical current. This allows them to be used to send, as well as receive, sound wave information. As the sound waves travel through different tissues in the body, they travel at different speeds. When the sound wave hits a border between two different types of tissue, some of the waves reflect and are directed back toward the probe. When they return to the probe, information regarding the distance and speed of travel for each sound wave is recorded, and a computer then compiles a 2D image.\n\n(8). In recent years, doppler ultrasound imaging has become available for creating 3D images. It uses the same type of probe as an ultrasound, but it creates an image with moving or rotating probes, and it then applies the concept of the doppler effect. The Doppler effect refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for an observer, who is moving relative to the wave source. That means that when a sound wave echoes back to the probe, the wave frequency will change based on the direction and the speed at which it is moving. A Doppler ultrasound then measures the change in frequency of the echoes to calculate how fast an object is moving. The computer can then create a 3D image with this technology. This technology is considered safe, and it is therefore used frequently for observing fetal progression in pregnant women. It is also frequently used for assessing blood clotting and internal bleeding in trauma wards.\n\n(9). Furthermore, MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, uses magnetism to produce detailed pictures of the inside of the body. It is a significant tool used in hospitals for detailed pictures of organs, soft tissues, bone, and virtually all other internal body structures. To use this machine, a patient is rolled inside a tube that is surrounded by a giant superconductive magnet. The magnet consists of a large, electrified wire coil that produces 2.0 teslas of magnetism. That is four times the power of the Earth’s magnetic field! Normally, this machine would require a lot of energy to run, but energy costs are brought down by lowering the resistance within the wires. This is achieved by bathing the wires in liquid helium kept at 269.1 degrees Celsius below zero. The whole system is then insulated inside of a vacuum.\n\n(10). An MRI machine works by creating a strong magnetic field that acts on the plentiful hydrogen molecules inside of the body. At any moment, each hydrogen molecule inside of a person is spinning along its axis in various directions. When placed in a strong magnetic field, the atoms have a strong magnetic moment. This means that they line up in the direction of the field.\n\n(11). A radio signal then disturbs the nucleus's axis of rotation and records the frequency signal that is produced when the nucleus goes back to its baseline state. The coils then pick up this signal and send it to the computer system. Based on the frequencies, the computer can then create a 2D or 3D layout of the different tissue types. The advantages of this technique are that you can create images of soft tissues along the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. There are also some major disadvantages, such as the equipment cost for doctors to buy and patients to use. Patients must also stay extremely still for up to 1.5 hours as any movement can distort the image quality. Individuals with any metal in their body, for example, a pacemaker or dental implants cannot enter the machine due to the strong magnetic force.\n\n(12). Lastly, positron emission tomography, or PET scans, are a type of nuclear medicine imaging. Instead of passing radiation through a patient’s tissues, this type of scan records radiation that comes from within the body. To create radiation within the body, a tracer substance is injected into the peripheral veins. The tracer is picked up by the targeted organ and the substance undergoes a process called positive beta decay. During this decay, a proton inside the nucleus of the tracer atom is converted into a neutron, and a positron, or the antiparticle of an electron, is released. After the positron travels a short distance, it loses its kinetic energy and will annihilate any electron that it encounters. The energy from this annihilation sends out gamma radiation, which is a beam of high-energy photons. These gamma rays are detected by the PET scanner and are then used to map organs and tissues on a computer. The PET scanner is often used to look at physiological functions, such as the excretory function of the kidneys or the rate of blood flow to the heart.\n\n(13). In the past century, advances in medical imaging have allowed doctors to learn about the progressions of diseases and better diagnose patients. As time passes on, advancements are being made in medical imaging that continually decrease the cost and increase the imaging quality. Just imagine what the next hundred years will bring!"

      "text": "(1). For most of history, doctors have relied on superficial descriptions of symptoms to diagnose disease. However, at the turn of the 20 th century, advances in physics brought new tools into the medical field that have given doctors a window into how the body functions. These tools have included: x-rays, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine.\n\n(2). X-ray is the oldest form of medical imaging. It uses electromagnetic radiation in the x-ray spectrum to create 2D images of internal structures. Before understanding how x-rays work, the behavior of electrons must be understood. On an atomic level, electrons with differing energy levels orbit an atom. The electrons can move to a higher energy level if they absorb a packet of energy, called a photon. This photon has a discrete amount of energy, which corresponds to the distance it needs to jump to reach a higher orbital. On the other hand, if the electron loses energy, it will emit a photon with a discrete amount of energy which corresponds to the distance it jumped to reach a lower orbital. If the discrete amount of energy in a photon does not equal the energy needs of the electron that it collides with, the photon will not be absorbed by the atom.\n\n(3). X-ray photons have too much energy to be absorbed by most of the atoms in the human body. That means that they pass right through our soft tissue and organs. However, x-ray photons have energy levels that correspond with the electron orbitals in bone tissue and many types of metal. This means that, while they are absorbed by bone tissue, they pass through soft tissue and thus create a shadow image of the bone’s structure on x-ray film.\n\n(4). An x-ray machine consists of a tube with a tungsten anode and a heat-filament cathode. There is a high voltage difference between the anode and the cathode, which causes electrons to fly between them. When the electrons hit the tungsten atoms, they knock an electron into a lower orbital. This emits a high-energy photon which is in the x-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The machine is surrounded by a thick piece of lead to keep the x-rays from scattering and has a small opening where a beam of x-ray photons is directed out. This beam is focused at a patient’s targeted area, and a film is placed facing the x-ray, thus recording the pattern of photons that pass through the soft tissues.\n\n(5). With the use of fluoroscopy (a three-dimensional modified x-ray imaging technique), doctors can look at softer tissues such as blood vessels and the gastrointestinal tract. To do this, the patient first must ingest a radiocontrast agent, most often a barium compound or iodine, which is absorbed into key issues. This causes the atoms of those tissues to absorb the x-rays, making them visible on a fluorescent screen, which records a moving image. Doctors can then track the movement of the radiocontrast agent as it moves through the body.\n\n(6). Computerized axial tomography, more commonly known as a CT or CAT scan, uses x-ray technology to create a 3D image of a patient’s internal structures along the axial plane. To create the image, a patient is moved through an x-ray tube with a revolving ring that is outfitted with x-ray beams and detectors. As the patient moves through the tube, the ring takes x-ray images from many different angles. The images are then rendered by a computer, which puts together a 3D model from each scan. This type of scan can give doctors a quick and finely detailed look at many different areas of the body. Therefore, it is the first choice for doctors in diagnosing emergency conditions such as cerebral trauma, appendicitis, kidney stones, and blockages in the arteries.\n\n(7). Not only do doctors use electromagnetic waves to see inside of the body, but they also harness sound waves to create images of internal structures. An ultrasound is one of the technologies to use this technique by sending sound waves through a targeted area. The main part of an ultrasound machine consists of a transducer probe. This probe contains one or more quartz crystals called piezoelectric crystals. These crystals change shape rapidly whenever an electric current is applied. The vibrations then travel outwardly as sound waves. When the crystals are in turn hit by a sound wave, they emit an electrical current. This allows them to be used to send, as well as receive, sound wave information. As the sound waves travel through different tissues in the body, they travel at different speeds. When the sound wave hits a border between two different types of tissue, some of the waves reflect and are directed back toward the probe. When they return to the probe, information regarding the distance and speed of travel for each sound wave is recorded, and a computer then compiles a 2D image.\n\n(8). In recent years, doppler ultrasound imaging has become available for creating 3D images. It uses the same type of probe as an ultrasound, but it creates an image with moving or rotating probes, and it then applies the concept of the doppler effect. The Doppler effect refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for an observer, who is moving relative to the wave source. That means that when a sound wave echoes back to the probe, the wave frequency will change based on the direction and the speed at which it is moving. A Doppler ultrasound then measures the change in frequency of the echoes to calculate how fast an object is moving. The computer can then create a 3D image with this technology. This technology is considered safe, and it is therefore used frequently for observing fetal progression in pregnant women. It is also frequently used for assessing blood clotting and internal bleeding in trauma wards.\n\n(9). Furthermore, MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, uses magnetism to produce detailed pictures of the inside of the body. It is a significant tool used in hospitals for detailed pictures of organs, soft tissues, bone, and virtually all other internal body structures. To use this machine, a patient is rolled inside a tube that is surrounded by a giant superconductive magnet. The magnet consists of a large, electrified wire coil that produces 2.0 teslas of magnetism. That is four times the power of the Earth’s magnetic field! Normally, this machine would require a lot of energy to run, but energy costs are brought down by lowering the resistance within the wires. This is achieved by bathing the wires in liquid helium kept at 269.1 degrees Celsius below zero. The whole system is then insulated inside of a vacuum.\n\n(10). An MRI machine works by creating a strong magnetic field that acts on the plentiful hydrogen molecules inside of the body. At any moment, each hydrogen molecule inside of a person is spinning along its axis in various directions. When placed in a strong magnetic field, the atoms have a strong magnetic moment. This means that they line up in the direction of the field.\n\n(11). A radio signal then disturbs the nucleus's axis of rotation and records the frequency signal that is produced when the nucleus goes back to its baseline state. The coils then pick up this signal and send it to the computer system. Based on the frequencies, the computer can then create a 2D or 3D layout of the different tissue types. The advantages of this technique are that you can create images of soft tissues along the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. There are also some major disadvantages, such as the equipment cost for doctors to buy and patients to use. Patients must also stay extremely still for up to 1.5 hours as any movement can distort the image quality. Individuals with any metal in their body, for example, a pacemaker or dental implants cannot enter the machine due to the strong magnetic force.\n\n(12). Lastly, positron emission tomography, or PET scans, are a type of nuclear medicine imaging. Instead of passing radiation through a patient’s tissues, this type of scan records radiation that comes from within the body. To create radiation within the body, a tracer substance is injected into the peripheral veins. The tracer is picked up by the targeted organ and the substance undergoes a process called positive beta decay. During this decay, a proton inside the nucleus of the tracer atom is converted into a neutron, and a positron, or the antiparticle of an electron, is released. After the positron travels a short distance, it loses its kinetic energy and will annihilate any electron that it encounters. The energy from this annihilation sends out gamma radiation, which is a beam of high-energy photons. These gamma rays are detected by the PET scanner and are then used to map organs and tissues on a computer. The PET scanner is often used to look at physiological functions, such as the excretory function of the kidneys or the rate of blood flow to the heart.\n\n(13). In the past century, advances in medical imaging have allowed doctors to learn about the progressions of diseases and better diagnose patients. As time passes on, advancements are being made in medical imaging that continually decrease the cost and increase the imaging quality. Just imagine what the next hundred years will bring!"

If the discrete amount of energy in a photon does not equal the energy needs of the electron that it collides with, the photon will not be absorbed by the atom.\n\n(3). X-ray photons have too much energy to be absorbed by most of the atoms in the human body. That means that they pass right through our soft tissue and organs. However, x-ray photons have energy levels that correspond with the electron orbitals in bone tissue and many types of metal. This means that, while they are absorbed by bone tissue, they pass through soft tissue and thus create a shadow image of the bone’s structure on x-ray film.\n\n(4). An x-ray machine consists of a tube with a tungsten anode and a heat-filament cathode. There is a high voltage difference between the anode and the cathode, which causes electrons to fly between them. When the electrons hit the tungsten atoms, they knock an electron into a lower orbital. This emits a high-energy photon which is in the x-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The machine is surrounded by a thick piece of lead to keep the x-rays from scattering and has a small opening where a beam of x-ray photons is directed out. This beam is focused at a patient’s targeted area, and a film is placed facing the x-ray, thus recording the pattern of photons that pass through the soft tissues.\n\n(5). With the use of fluoroscopy (a three-dimensional modified x-ray imaging technique), doctors can look at softer tissues such as blood vessels and the gastrointestinal tract. To do this, the patient first must ingest a radiocontrast agent, most often a barium compound or iodine, which is absorbed into key issues. This causes the atoms of those tissues to absorb the x-rays, making them visible on a fluorescent screen, which records a moving image. Doctors can then track the movement of the radiocontrast agent as it moves through the body.\n\n(6). Computerized axial tomography, more commonly known as a CT or CAT scan, uses x-ray technology to create a 3D image of a patient’s internal structures along the axial plane. To create the image, a patient is moved through an x-ray tube with a revolving ring that is outfitted with x-ray beams and detectors. As the patient moves through the tube, the ring takes x-ray images from many different angles. The images are then rendered by a computer, which puts together a 3D model from each scan. This type of scan can give doctors a quick and finely detailed look at many different areas of the body. Therefore, it is the first choice for doctors in diagnosing emergency conditions such as cerebral trauma, appendicitis, kidney stones, and blockages in the arteries.\n\n(7). Not only do doctors use electromagnetic waves to see inside of the body, but they also harness sound waves to create images of internal structures. An ultrasound is one of the technologies to use this technique by sending sound waves through a targeted area. The main part of an ultrasound machine consists of a transducer probe. This probe contains one or more quartz crystals called piezoelectric crystals. These crystals change shape rapidly whenever an electric current is applied. The vibrations then travel outwardly as sound waves. When the crystals are in turn hit by a sound wave, they emit an electrical current. This allows them to be used to send, as well as receive, sound wave information. As the sound waves travel through different tissues in the body, they travel at different speeds. When the sound wave hits a border between two different types of tissue, some of the waves reflect and are directed back toward the probe. When they return to the probe, information regarding the distance and speed of travel for each sound wave is recorded, and a computer then compiles a 2D image.\n\n(8). In recent years, doppler ultrasound imaging has become available for creating 3D images. It uses the same type of probe as an ultrasound, but it creates an image with moving or rotating probes, and it then applies the concept of the doppler effect. The Doppler effect refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for an observer, who is moving relative to the wave source. That means that when a sound wave echoes back to the probe, the wave frequency will change based on the direction and the speed at which it is moving. A Doppler ultrasound then measures the change in frequency of the echoes to calculate how fast an object is moving. The computer can then create a 3D image with this technology. This technology is considered safe, and it is therefore used frequently for observing fetal progression in pregnant women. It is also frequently used for assessing blood clotting and internal bleeding in trauma wards.\n\n(9). Furthermore, MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, uses magnetism to produce detailed pictures of the inside of the body. It is a significant tool used in hospitals for detailed pictures of organs, soft tissues, bone, and virtually all other internal body structures. To use this machine, a patient is rolled inside a tube that is surrounded by a giant superconductive magnet. The magnet consists of a large, electrified wire coil that produces 2.0 teslas of magnetism. That is four times the power of the Earth’s magnetic field! Normally, this machine would require a lot of energy to run, but energy costs are brought down by lowering the resistance within the wires. This is achieved by bathing the wires in liquid helium kept at 269.1 degrees Celsius below zero. The whole system is then insulated inside of a vacuum.\n\n(10). An MRI machine works by creating a strong magnetic field that acts on the plentiful hydrogen molecules inside of the body. At any moment, each hydrogen molecule inside of a person is spinning along its axis in various directions. When placed in a strong magnetic field, the atoms have a strong magnetic moment. This means that they line up in the direction of the field.\n\n(11). A radio signal then disturbs the nucleus's axis of rotation and records the frequency signal that is produced when the nucleus goes back to its baseline state. The coils then pick up this signal and send it to the computer system. Based on the frequencies, the computer can then create a 2D or 3D layout of the different tissue types. The advantages of this technique are that you can create images of soft tissues along the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. There are also some major disadvantages, such as the equipment cost for doctors to buy and patients to use. Patients must also stay extremely still for up to 1.5 hours as any movement can distort the image quality. Individuals with any metal in their body, for example, a pacemaker or dental implants cannot enter the machine due to the strong magnetic force.\n\n(12). Lastly, positron emission tomography, or PET scans, are a type of nuclear medicine imaging. Instead of passing radiation through a patient’s tissues, this type of scan records radiation that comes from within the body. To create radiation within the body, a tracer substance is injected into the peripheral veins. The tracer is picked up by the targeted organ and the substance undergoes a process called positive beta decay. During this decay, a proton inside the nucleus of the tracer atom is converted into a neutron, and a positron, or the antiparticle of an electron, is released. After the positron travels a short distance, it loses its kinetic energy and will annihilate any electron that it encounters. The energy from this annihilation sends out gamma radiation, which is a beam of high-energy photons. These gamma rays are detected by the PET scanner and are then used to map organs and tissues on a computer. The PET scanner is often used to look at physiological functions, such as the excretory function of the kidneys or the rate of blood flow to the heart.\n\n(13). In the past century, advances in medical imaging have allowed doctors to learn about the progressions of diseases and better diagnose patients. As time passes on, advancements are being made in medical imaging that continually decrease the cost and increase the imaging quality. Just imagine what the next hundred years will bring!"

      "text": "(1). For most of history, doctors have relied on superficial descriptions of symptoms to diagnose disease. However, at the turn of the 20 th century, advances in physics brought new tools into the medical field that have given doctors a window into how the body functions. These tools have included: x-rays, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine.\n\n(2). X-ray is the oldest form of medical imaging. It uses electromagnetic radiation in the x-ray spectrum to create 2D images of internal structures. Before understanding how x-rays work, the behavior of electrons must be understood. On an atomic level, electrons with differing energy levels orbit an atom. The electrons can move to a higher energy level if they absorb a packet of energy, called a photon. This photon has a discrete amount of energy, which corresponds to the distance it needs to jump to reach a higher orbital. On the other hand, if the electron loses energy, it will emit a photon with a discrete amount of energy which corresponds to the distance it jumped to reach a lower orbital. If the discrete amount of energy in a photon does not equal the energy needs of the electron that it collides with, the photon will not be absorbed by the atom.\n\n(3).
