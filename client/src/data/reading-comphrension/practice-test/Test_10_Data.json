      "text": "(1). The evolution of pharmaceuticals and access to medical care has equipped humans with unprecedented protection against a variety of health problems. However, over the past few decades, the misuse and abuse of prescription drugs have led to a global opioid crisis. The number of deaths due to opioid overdose has been steadily increasing, while opioid poisoning has led to 30% more hospitalizations today compared to a decade ago. In Canada alone, the number of opioid-related deaths surged to approximately 4000 in 2017. The opioid crisis has negative impacts that extend beyond the healthcare sector, as social and economic welfare suffer as well.\n\n(2). Economic effects of the opioid crisis have included an increased burden on the medical system. Healthcare workers have had to devote greater resources to addiction treatment and overdose cases, as well as to those patients suffering from the long-term effects of opioid addiction, such as liver and heart disease. The opioid crisis has had further economic repercussions because those who suffer from opioid addiction may struggle to maintain productivity in the workplace, leading to reduced participation and, as the addiction worsens, disability claims. Social welfare is impacted because in areas where opioid addiction is prevalent, there may be higher rates of financial hardship amongst families, generational poverty, and social upheaval for children of addicted parents. As such, the demand for social services and foster care placements increases, as does the demand on police forces, since resources must be allocated toward issues such as drug trafficking.\n\n(3). Opioids are a class of drugs used to reduce pain and improve function. They can produce feelings of euphoria or a “high,” which is the reason they are so addictive. Opioids bind to cells located in parts of the brain, spinal cord, and other organs in the body, especially those involved in sensing pain and pleasure - by attaching to these receptors, they block pain signals sent from the body and release dopamine, causing the person to want to recreate the effects of the drug.\n\n(4). The opioid crisis has occurred in three waves. The first wave transpired in the late 1990s when healthcare providers began to prescribe pain relievers at higher rates - this was because pharmaceutical companies claimed that they had minimized the addictive properties of these drugs. Some common prescription pain relievers include oxycodone, hydrocode, codeine, and morphine. Communities, where opioids were readily available and prescribed liberally, were the first to experience abuse and diversion; as a result, the use of prescription drugs became more widespread locally, mainly among friends and family.\n\n(5). The second wave was caused by heroin abuse. Heroin is made from the natural substance morphine, which is taken from the seed pod of various opium poppy plants grown in Southeast Asia, Mexico, and Colombia. When regulations on prescription drugs made them harder to obtain, heroin presented itself as a cheap, widely available, and powerful opioid. Heroin is commonly injected, which increases the risk for injection-related diseases such as HIV/AIDS, HEP B&C, skin, bloodstream, and heart infections.\n\n(6). The third wave of the opioid crisis was caused by Fentanyl, which is possibly the deadliest of all opioids. Originally used as a surgical anesthetic and a potent pain reliever, Fentanyl has recently been synthesized in illegal labs and sold as a street drug or, alternatively, mixed with drugs like cocaine to bolster profits. Fentanyl can be found in tablets or powder form; these increase the risk of overdose since people are unaware of the nature of the substance and its dosage. More than 70% of opioid-related deaths in 2017 were attributed to fentanyl or its analogues. Troublingly, there are no visible indicators that fentanyl has been mixed with another drug because it cannot be smelled, seen, or tasted. As such, it is vital to select a trustworthy provider when acquiring prescription drugs, since fentanyl can be lethal even in small doses. A fentanyl overdose can be identified through slowed or absent breathing, blue coloration of lips or fingertips, lack of consciousness and pinpoint pupils.\n\n(7). Although opioids are effective as pain-relievers, there are alternative treatments for pain relief that can be just as useful. Over-the-counter or prescribed non-opioid medications such as ibuprofen (Motrin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin (Bayer), and steroids are reported to be enough for patients’ needs. Additionally, physical therapy through an exercise program created by a licensed physiotherapist can help reduce pain and improve function. Such a program can include components of whirlpools and deep-tissue massages to accelerate healing. Acupuncture is another treatment that involves the use of thin needles inserted at various areas of the skin to block pain signals. Alternatively, injections with localized anesthetics can decrease muscle spasms and nerve pain. If none of the above treatment methods prove useful, surgery is the last resort that can make a difference in cases where a bodily irregularity is the root of the pain. Despite the established clinical benefit of these methods, technology has given way to even more innovative approaches to treating pain.\n\n(8). Technology is developing faster than ever before and, consequently, modern treatment methods are quickly emerging. In radio wave-targeted pain removal, a needle is inserted next to the nerve responsible for pain; next, the electrical currents created by radio waves are used to burn the nerve. In turn, this causes the pain signal to short-circuit and thus remain unsensed for up to one year. Electrical signals can be used in a similar way, but their exact method of action is not as clearly understood. These signals are used for short-term relief from muscle pain, where pods attached to the skin deliver low-voltage electrical signals from an external source. Scientists believe the signals play a role in interrupting nerve-brain communication, or act by releasing the body’s natural painkillers. Furthermore, stem cells have emerged as a promising area of study and research for pain treatment in recent years. Deteriorating tissue that causes pain can be rebuilt into new and healthy tissue by injection of stem cells derived from a patient’s bone marrow into the affected area.\n\n(9). Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a surgical treatment method that involves the implantation of a stimulator by a neurosurgeon or a pain management specialist that works to interfere with pain signals sent to the brain. However, before the stimulator is inserted, a trial run is conducted to test whether the device makes a difference in the type, location, and severity of the afflicted individual’s pain. Spinal cord stimulators come in a variety of forms, but all consist of a pulse generator, a lead wire with electrodes that deliver signals to the spinal cord, and a hand-held remote that allows the user to control the settings. The remote provides control of pulse rate, pulse width (which determines the area of coverage), and pulse amplitude (which correlates to the limit of pain perception). The stimulator works by sending electrical impulses to the spinal cord, where it then interferes with nerve signals being delivered to the brain. Thus, pain perception is either reduced or replaced by a tingling sensation. It should be noted that the procedure is associated with several risks, including cerebrospinal fluid leak, pain at the stimulator site, allergic response, and paralysis below the point of implantation. It can be expected that such risks will be lowered with more research and technological advancement; regardless, the patient and their doctor need to thoroughly analyze all circumstances before proceeding with the surgery.\n\n(10). The social implications of the opioid crisis are equally important when it comes to devising an action plan. There is a misunderstanding about the addictive nature of opioids amongst the general population, so people tend to use them excessively without considering the negative consequences. The fact that opioids are prescribed frequently and in high doses further complicates the situation. The lack of awareness surrounding alternative treatments such as physical therapy also contributes to opioid overuse. Opioids are relatively cheap and accessible for those who are unaware of other options; moreover, the mixing of Fentanyl with illegal drugs makes opioids almost impossible to track, thus making it very difficult to cut the supply at its roots. Other psychological, social, and biological risk factors play a major role in opioid dependence as well. For example, those with genetic predisposition, mental health problems, early life trauma, poverty, and non-secure housing are more susceptible to opioid addiction. Lastly, the stigma around substance abuse discourages individuals from seeking help.\n\n(11). Specific genetic factors that may predispose an individual to opioid addiction include a reduced ability to produce natural pain-relieving chemicals, such as endorphins, or a naturally increased sensitivity to the effects of opioids. A person’s psychology can also play into their propensity for opioid addiction, since individuals with anxiety, depression, or PTSD, for instance, may use opioids as a means of self-medicating. Those who have experienced trauma in early childhood may be especially vulnerable to opioid addiction. If one does not develop healthy coping skills early in life, substances may be used in place of such skills. When it comes to social factors, poverty can make an individual more likely to turn to opioids as a coping mechanism since poverty creates stress, and opioids may be used to help with these stresses. Finally, social stigma may aggravate an already existing addiction, since people may fear discrimination should they seek help.\n\n(12). The appropriate way to manage opioid misuse and abuse has been the subject of discussion for years. Although a lack of consensus on the matter is preventing an action plan from being put into motion, the following are some points that must be addressed. Firstly, awareness should be a cornerstone of the solution; people should be made cognisant of dosage poisoning, which would reduce their risk of accidental overdose. Secondly, preventative measures should also be a significant focus because studies show that the earlier a person is exposed to such substances, the higher the possibility of developing a substance use disorder. An example of this can be seen in Southern Europe, where the legal drinking age is 16. Consequently, teens and young adults in these regions engage more frequently in binge drinking, compared to the same age cohort in North America, where the drinking age is 19 in Canada and 21 in the US. Moreover, we should view addiction as a biological implication rather than a social and moral failure. This notion is supported by evidence that early life experiences can induce chemical changes in the brain, which alter its reward system and stress response; this change of perspective removes the stigma and focuses on marginalized groups. Development of the drug treatment industry and expanding addiction support groups could go a long way in minimizing addictive behaviors. It is time to stop viewing opioid addiction as a human failure and instead tackle the biological reasons behind it."

In radio wave-targeted pain removal, a needle is inserted next to the nerve responsible for pain; next, the electrical currents created by radio waves are used to burn the nerve. In turn, this causes the pain signal to short-circuit and thus remain unsensed for up to one year. Electrical signals can be used in a similar way, but their exact method of action is not as clearly understood. These signals are used for short-term relief from muscle pain, where pods attached to the skin deliver low-voltage electrical signals from an external source. Scientists believe the signals play a role in interrupting nerve-brain communication, or act by releasing the body’s natural painkillers. Furthermore, stem cells have emerged as a promising area of study and research for pain treatment in recent years. Deteriorating tissue that causes pain can be rebuilt into new and healthy tissue by injection of stem cells derived from a patient’s bone marrow into the affected area.\n\n(9). Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a surgical treatment method that involves the implantation of a stimulator by a neurosurgeon or a pain management specialist that works to interfere with pain signals sent to the brain. However, before the stimulator is inserted, a trial run is conducted to test whether the device makes a difference in the type, location, and severity of the afflicted individual’s pain. Spinal cord stimulators come in a variety of forms, but all consist of a pulse generator, a lead wire with electrodes that deliver signals to the spinal cord, and a hand-held remote that allows the user to control the settings. The remote provides control of pulse rate, pulse width (which determines the area of coverage), and pulse amplitude (which correlates to the limit of pain perception). The stimulator works by sending electrical impulses to the spinal cord, where it then interferes with nerve signals being delivered to the brain. Thus, pain perception is either reduced or replaced by a tingling sensation. It should be noted that the procedure is associated with several risks, including cerebrospinal fluid leak, pain at the stimulator site, allergic response, and paralysis below the point of implantation. It can be expected that such risks will be lowered with more research and technological advancement; regardless, the patient and their doctor need to thoroughly analyze all circumstances before proceeding with the surgery.\n\n(10). The social implications of the opioid crisis are equally important when it comes to devising an action plan. There is a misunderstanding about the addictive nature of opioids amongst the general population, so people tend to use them excessively without considering the negative consequences. The fact that opioids are prescribed frequently and in high doses further complicates the situation. The lack of awareness surrounding alternative treatments such as physical therapy also contributes to opioid overuse. Opioids are relatively cheap and accessible for those who are unaware of other options; moreover, the mixing of Fentanyl with illegal drugs makes opioids almost impossible to track, thus making it very difficult to cut the supply at its roots. Other psychological, social, and biological risk factors play a major role in opioid dependence as well. For example, those with genetic predisposition, mental health problems, early life trauma, poverty, and non-secure housing are more susceptible to opioid addiction. Lastly, the stigma around substance abuse discourages individuals from seeking help.\n\n(11). Specific genetic factors that may predispose an individual to opioid addiction include a reduced ability to produce natural pain-relieving chemicals, such as endorphins, or a naturally increased sensitivity to the effects of opioids. A person’s psychology can also play into their propensity for opioid addiction, since individuals with anxiety, depression, or PTSD, for instance, may use opioids as a means of self-medicating. Those who have experienced trauma in early childhood may be especially vulnerable to opioid addiction. If one does not develop healthy coping skills early in life, substances may be used in place of such skills. When it comes to social factors, poverty can make an individual more likely to turn to opioids as a coping mechanism since poverty creates stress, and opioids may be used to help with these stresses. Finally, social stigma may aggravate an already existing addiction, since people may fear discrimination should they seek help.\n\n(12). The appropriate way to manage opioid misuse and abuse has been the subject of discussion for years. Although a lack of consensus on the matter is preventing an action plan from being put into motion, the following are some points that must be addressed. Firstly, awareness should be a cornerstone of the solution; people should be made cognisant of dosage poisoning, which would reduce their risk of accidental overdose. Secondly, preventative measures should also be a significant focus because studies show that the earlier a person is exposed to such substances, the higher the possibility of developing a substance use disorder. An example of this can be seen in Southern Europe, where the legal drinking age is 16. Consequently, teens and young adults in these regions engage more frequently in binge drinking, compared to the same age cohort in North America, where the drinking age is 19 in Canada and 21 in the US. Moreover, we should view addiction as a biological implication rather than a social and moral failure. This notion is supported by evidence that early life experiences can induce chemical changes in the brain, which alter its reward system and stress response; this change of perspective removes the stigma and focuses on marginalized groups. Development of the drug treatment industry and expanding addiction support groups could go a long way in minimizing addictive behaviors. It is time to stop viewing opioid addiction as a human failure and instead tackle the biological reasons behind it."

      "text": "(1). The evolution of pharmaceuticals and access to medical care has equipped humans with unprecedented protection against a variety of health problems. However, over the past few decades, the misuse and abuse of prescription drugs have led to a global opioid crisis. The number of deaths due to opioid overdose has been steadily increasing, while opioid poisoning has led to 30% more hospitalizations today compared to a decade ago. In Canada alone, the number of opioid-related deaths surged to approximately 4000 in 2017. The opioid crisis has negative impacts that extend beyond the healthcare sector, as social and economic welfare suffer as well.\n\n(2). Economic effects of the opioid crisis have included an increased burden on the medical system. Healthcare workers have had to devote greater resources to addiction treatment and overdose cases, as well as to those patients suffering from the long-term effects of opioid addiction, such as liver and heart disease. The opioid crisis has had further economic repercussions because those who suffer from opioid addiction may struggle to maintain productivity in the workplace, leading to reduced participation and, as the addiction worsens, disability claims. Social welfare is impacted because in areas where opioid addiction is prevalent, there may be higher rates of financial hardship amongst families, generational poverty, and social upheaval for children of addicted parents. As such, the demand for social services and foster care placements increases, as does the demand on police forces, since resources must be allocated toward issues such as drug trafficking.\n\n(3). Opioids are a class of drugs used to reduce pain and improve function. They can produce feelings of euphoria or a “high,” which is the reason they are so addictive. Opioids bind to cells located in parts of the brain, spinal cord, and other organs in the body, especially those involved in sensing pain and pleasure - by attaching to these receptors, they block pain signals sent from the body and release dopamine, causing the person to want to recreate the effects of the drug.\n\n(4). The opioid crisis has occurred in three waves. The first wave transpired in the late 1990s when healthcare providers began to prescribe pain relievers at higher rates - this was because pharmaceutical companies claimed that they had minimized the addictive properties of these drugs. Some common prescription pain relievers include oxycodone, hydrocode, codeine, and morphine. Communities, where opioids were readily available and prescribed liberally, were the first to experience abuse and diversion; as a result, the use of prescription drugs became more widespread locally, mainly among friends and family.\n\n(5). The second wave was caused by heroin abuse. Heroin is made from the natural substance morphine, which is taken from the seed pod of various opium poppy plants grown in Southeast Asia, Mexico, and Colombia. When regulations on prescription drugs made them harder to obtain, heroin presented itself as a cheap, widely available, and powerful opioid. Heroin is commonly injected, which increases the risk for injection-related diseases such as HIV/AIDS, HEP B&C, skin, bloodstream, and heart infections.\n\n(6). The third wave of the opioid crisis was caused by Fentanyl, which is possibly the deadliest of all opioids. Originally used as a surgical anesthetic and a potent pain reliever, Fentanyl has recently been synthesized in illegal labs and sold as a street drug or, alternatively, mixed with drugs like cocaine to bolster profits. Fentanyl can be found in tablets or powder form; these increase the risk of overdose since people are unaware of the nature of the substance and its dosage. More than 70% of opioid-related deaths in 2017 were attributed to fentanyl or its analogues. Troublingly, there are no visible indicators that fentanyl has been mixed with another drug because it cannot be smelled, seen, or tasted. As such, it is vital to select a trustworthy provider when acquiring prescription drugs, since fentanyl can be lethal even in small doses. A fentanyl overdose can be identified through slowed or absent breathing, blue coloration of lips or fingertips, lack of consciousness and pinpoint pupils.\n\n(7). Although opioids are effective as pain-relievers, there are alternative treatments for pain relief that can be just as useful. Over-the-counter or prescribed non-opioid medications such as ibuprofen (Motrin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin (Bayer), and steroids are reported to be enough for patients’ needs. Additionally, physical therapy through an exercise program created by a licensed physiotherapist can help reduce pain and improve function. Such a program can include components of whirlpools and deep-tissue massages to accelerate healing. Acupuncture is another treatment that involves the use of thin needles inserted at various areas of the skin to block pain signals. Alternatively, injections with localized anesthetics can decrease muscle spasms and nerve pain. If none of the above treatment methods prove useful, surgery is the last resort that can make a difference in cases where a bodily irregularity is the root of the pain. Despite the established clinical benefit of these methods, technology has given way to even more innovative approaches to treating pain.\n\n(8). Technology is developing faster than ever before and, consequently, modern treatment methods are quickly emerging. In radio wave-targeted pain removal, a needle is inserted next to the nerve responsible for pain; next, the electrical currents created by radio waves are used to burn the nerve. In turn, this causes the pain signal to short-circuit and thus remain unsensed for up to one year. Electrical signals can be used in a similar way, but their exact method of action is not as clearly understood.

However, before the stimulator is inserted, a trial run is conducted to test whether the device makes a difference in the type, location, and severity of the afflicted individual’s pain. Spinal cord stimulators come in a variety of forms, but all consist of a pulse generator, a lead wire with electrodes that deliver signals to the spinal cord, and a hand-held remote that allows the user to control the settings. The remote provides control of pulse rate, pulse width (which determines the area of coverage), and pulse amplitude (which correlates to the limit of pain perception). The stimulator works by sending electrical impulses to the spinal cord, where it then interferes with nerve signals being delivered to the brain. Thus, pain perception is either reduced or replaced by a tingling sensation. It should be noted that the procedure is associated with several risks, including cerebrospinal fluid leak, pain at the stimulator site, allergic response, and paralysis below the point of implantation. It can be expected that such risks will be lowered with more research and technological advancement; regardless, the patient and their doctor need to thoroughly analyze all circumstances before proceeding with the surgery.\n\n(10).

      "text": "(1). The evolution of pharmaceuticals and access to medical care has equipped humans with unprecedented protection against a variety of health problems. However, over the past few decades, the misuse and abuse of prescription drugs have led to a global opioid crisis. The number of deaths due to opioid overdose has been steadily increasing, while opioid poisoning has led to 30% more hospitalizations today compared to a decade ago. In Canada alone, the number of opioid-related deaths surged to approximately 4000 in 2017. The opioid crisis has negative impacts that extend beyond the healthcare sector, as social and economic welfare suffer as well.\n\n(2). Economic effects of the opioid crisis have included an increased burden on the medical system. Healthcare workers have had to devote greater resources to addiction treatment and overdose cases, as well as to those patients suffering from the long-term effects of opioid addiction, such as liver and heart disease. The opioid crisis has had further economic repercussions because those who suffer from opioid addiction may struggle to maintain productivity in the workplace, leading to reduced participation and, as the addiction worsens, disability claims. Social welfare is impacted because in areas where opioid addiction is prevalent, there may be higher rates of financial hardship amongst families, generational poverty, and social upheaval for children of addicted parents. As such, the demand for social services and foster care placements increases, as does the demand on police forces, since resources must be allocated toward issues such as drug trafficking.\n\n(3). Opioids are a class of drugs used to reduce pain and improve function. They can produce feelings of euphoria or a “high,” which is the reason they are so addictive. Opioids bind to cells located in parts of the brain, spinal cord, and other organs in the body, especially those involved in sensing pain and pleasure - by attaching to these receptors, they block pain signals sent from the body and release dopamine, causing the person to want to recreate the effects of the drug.\n\n(4). The opioid crisis has occurred in three waves. The first wave transpired in the late 1990s when healthcare providers began to prescribe pain relievers at higher rates - this was because pharmaceutical companies claimed that they had minimized the addictive properties of these drugs. Some common prescription pain relievers include oxycodone, hydrocode, codeine, and morphine. Communities, where opioids were readily available and prescribed liberally, were the first to experience abuse and diversion; as a result, the use of prescription drugs became more widespread locally, mainly among friends and family.\n\n(5). The second wave was caused by heroin abuse. Heroin is made from the natural substance morphine, which is taken from the seed pod of various opium poppy plants grown in Southeast Asia, Mexico, and Colombia. When regulations on prescription drugs made them harder to obtain, heroin presented itself as a cheap, widely available, and powerful opioid. Heroin is commonly injected, which increases the risk for injection-related diseases such as HIV/AIDS, HEP B&C, skin, bloodstream, and heart infections.\n\n(6). The third wave of the opioid crisis was caused by Fentanyl, which is possibly the deadliest of all opioids. Originally used as a surgical anesthetic and a potent pain reliever, Fentanyl has recently been synthesized in illegal labs and sold as a street drug or, alternatively, mixed with drugs like cocaine to bolster profits. Fentanyl can be found in tablets or powder form; these increase the risk of overdose since people are unaware of the nature of the substance and its dosage. More than 70% of opioid-related deaths in 2017 were attributed to fentanyl or its analogues. Troublingly, there are no visible indicators that fentanyl has been mixed with another drug because it cannot be smelled, seen, or tasted. As such, it is vital to select a trustworthy provider when acquiring prescription drugs, since fentanyl can be lethal even in small doses. A fentanyl overdose can be identified through slowed or absent breathing, blue coloration of lips or fingertips, lack of consciousness and pinpoint pupils.\n\n(7). Although opioids are effective as pain-relievers, there are alternative treatments for pain relief that can be just as useful. Over-the-counter or prescribed non-opioid medications such as ibuprofen (Motrin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin (Bayer), and steroids are reported to be enough for patients’ needs. Additionally, physical therapy through an exercise program created by a licensed physiotherapist can help reduce pain and improve function. Such a program can include components of whirlpools and deep-tissue massages to accelerate healing. Acupuncture is another treatment that involves the use of thin needles inserted at various areas of the skin to block pain signals. Alternatively, injections with localized anesthetics can decrease muscle spasms and nerve pain. If none of the above treatment methods prove useful, surgery is the last resort that can make a difference in cases where a bodily irregularity is the root of the pain. Despite the established clinical benefit of these methods, technology has given way to even more innovative approaches to treating pain.\n\n(8). Technology is developing faster than ever before and, consequently, modern treatment methods are quickly emerging. In radio wave-targeted pain removal, a needle is inserted next to the nerve responsible for pain; next, the electrical currents created by radio waves are used to burn the nerve. In turn, this causes the pain signal to short-circuit and thus remain unsensed for up to one year. Electrical signals can be used in a similar way, but their exact method of action is not as clearly understood. These signals are used for short-term relief from muscle pain, where pods attached to the skin deliver low-voltage electrical signals from an external source. Scientists believe the signals play a role in interrupting nerve-brain communication, or act by releasing the body’s natural painkillers. Furthermore, stem cells have emerged as a promising area of study and research for pain treatment in recent years. Deteriorating tissue that causes pain can be rebuilt into new and healthy tissue by injection of stem cells derived from a patient’s bone marrow into the affected area.\n\n(9). Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a surgical treatment method that involves the implantation of a stimulator by a neurosurgeon or a pain management specialist that works to interfere with pain signals sent to the brain. However, before the stimulator is inserted, a trial run is conducted to test whether the device makes a difference in the type, location, and severity of the afflicted individual’s pain. Spinal cord stimulators come in a variety of forms, but all consist of a pulse generator, a lead wire with electrodes that deliver signals to the spinal cord, and a hand-held remote that allows the user to control the settings. The remote provides control of pulse rate, pulse width (which determines the area of coverage), and pulse amplitude (which correlates to the limit of pain perception). The stimulator works by sending electrical impulses to the spinal cord, where it then interferes with nerve signals being delivered to the brain. Thus, pain perception is either reduced or replaced by a tingling sensation. It should be noted that the procedure is associated with several risks, including cerebrospinal fluid leak, pain at the stimulator site, allergic response, and paralysis below the point of implantation. It can be expected that such risks will be lowered with more research and technological advancement; regardless, the patient and their doctor need to thoroughly analyze all circumstances before proceeding with the surgery.\n\n(10). The social implications of the opioid crisis are equally important when it comes to devising an action plan. There is a misunderstanding about the addictive nature of opioids amongst the general population, so people tend to use them excessively without considering the negative consequences. The fact that opioids are prescribed frequently and in high doses further complicates the situation. The lack of awareness surrounding alternative treatments such as physical therapy also contributes to opioid overuse. Opioids are relatively cheap and accessible for those who are unaware of other options; moreover, the mixing of Fentanyl with illegal drugs makes opioids almost impossible to track, thus making it very difficult to cut the supply at its roots. Other psychological, social, and biological risk factors play a major role in opioid dependence as well. For example, those with genetic predisposition, mental health problems, early life trauma, poverty, and non-secure housing are more susceptible to opioid addiction. Lastly, the stigma around substance abuse discourages individuals from seeking help.\n\n(11). Specific genetic factors that may predispose an individual to opioid addiction include a reduced ability to produce natural pain-relieving chemicals, such as endorphins, or a naturally increased sensitivity to the effects of opioids. A person’s psychology can also play into their propensity for opioid addiction, since individuals with anxiety, depression, or PTSD, for instance, may use opioids as a means of self-medicating. Those who have experienced trauma in early childhood may be especially vulnerable to opioid addiction. If one does not develop healthy coping skills early in life, substances may be used in place of such skills. When it comes to social factors, poverty can make an individual more likely to turn to opioids as a coping mechanism since poverty creates stress, and opioids may be used to help with these stresses. Finally, social stigma may aggravate an already existing addiction, since people may fear discrimination should they seek help.\n\n(12). The appropriate way to manage opioid misuse and abuse has been the subject of discussion for years. Although a lack of consensus on the matter is preventing an action plan from being put into motion, the following are some points that must be addressed. Firstly, awareness should be a cornerstone of the solution; people should be made cognisant of dosage poisoning, which would reduce their risk of accidental overdose. Secondly, preventative measures should also be a significant focus because studies show that the earlier a person is exposed to such substances, the higher the possibility of developing a substance use disorder. An example of this can be seen in Southern Europe, where the legal drinking age is 16. Consequently, teens and young adults in these regions engage more frequently in binge drinking, compared to the same age cohort in North America, where the drinking age is 19 in Canada and 21 in the US. Moreover, we should view addiction as a biological implication rather than a social and moral failure. This notion is supported by evidence that early life experiences can induce chemical changes in the brain, which alter its reward system and stress response; this change of perspective removes the stigma and focuses on marginalized groups. Development of the drug treatment industry and expanding addiction support groups could go a long way in minimizing addictive behaviors. It is time to stop viewing opioid addiction as a human failure and instead tackle the biological reasons behind it."

Opioids bind to cells located in parts of the brain, spinal cord, and other organs in the body, especially those involved in sensing pain and pleasure - by attaching to these receptors, they block pain signals sent from the body and release dopamine, causing the person to want to recreate the effects of the drug.\n\n(4). The opioid crisis has occurred in three waves. The first wave transpired in the late 1990s when healthcare providers began to prescribe pain relievers at higher rates - this was because pharmaceutical companies claimed that they had minimized the addictive properties of these drugs. Some common prescription pain relievers include oxycodone, hydrocode, codeine, and morphine. Communities, where opioids were readily available and prescribed liberally, were the first to experience abuse and diversion; as a result, the use of prescription drugs became more widespread locally, mainly among friends and family.\n\n(5). The second wave was caused by heroin abuse. Heroin is made from the natural substance morphine, which is taken from the seed pod of various opium poppy plants grown in Southeast Asia, Mexico, and Colombia. When regulations on prescription drugs made them harder to obtain, heroin presented itself as a cheap, widely available, and powerful opioid. Heroin is commonly injected, which increases the risk for injection-related diseases such as HIV/AIDS, HEP B&C, skin, bloodstream, and heart infections.\n\n(6). The third wave of the opioid crisis was caused by Fentanyl, which is possibly the deadliest of all opioids. Originally used as a surgical anesthetic and a potent pain reliever, Fentanyl has recently been synthesized in illegal labs and sold as a street drug or, alternatively, mixed with drugs like cocaine to bolster profits. Fentanyl can be found in tablets or powder form; these increase the risk of overdose since people are unaware of the nature of the substance and its dosage. More than 70% of opioid-related deaths in 2017 were attributed to fentanyl or its analogues. Troublingly, there are no visible indicators that fentanyl has been mixed with another drug because it cannot be smelled, seen, or tasted. As such, it is vital to select a trustworthy provider when acquiring prescription drugs, since fentanyl can be lethal even in small doses. A fentanyl overdose can be identified through slowed or absent breathing, blue coloration of lips or fingertips, lack of consciousness and pinpoint pupils.\n\n(7). Although opioids are effective as pain-relievers, there are alternative treatments for pain relief that can be just as useful. Over-the-counter or prescribed non-opioid medications such as ibuprofen (Motrin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin (Bayer), and steroids are reported to be enough for patients’ needs. Additionally, physical therapy through an exercise program created by a licensed physiotherapist can help reduce pain and improve function. Such a program can include components of whirlpools and deep-tissue massages to accelerate healing. Acupuncture is another treatment that involves the use of thin needles inserted at various areas of the skin to block pain signals. Alternatively, injections with localized anesthetics can decrease muscle spasms and nerve pain. If none of the above treatment methods prove useful, surgery is the last resort that can make a difference in cases where a bodily irregularity is the root of the pain. Despite the established clinical benefit of these methods, technology has given way to even more innovative approaches to treating pain.\n\n(8). Technology is developing faster than ever before and, consequently, modern treatment methods are quickly emerging. In radio wave-targeted pain removal, a needle is inserted next to the nerve responsible for pain; next, the electrical currents created by radio waves are used to burn the nerve. In turn, this causes the pain signal to short-circuit and thus remain unsensed for up to one year. Electrical signals can be used in a similar way, but their exact method of action is not as clearly understood. These signals are used for short-term relief from muscle pain, where pods attached to the skin deliver low-voltage electrical signals from an external source. Scientists believe the signals play a role in interrupting nerve-brain communication, or act by releasing the body’s natural painkillers. Furthermore, stem cells have emerged as a promising area of study and research for pain treatment in recent years. Deteriorating tissue that causes pain can be rebuilt into new and healthy tissue by injection of stem cells derived from a patient’s bone marrow into the affected area.\n\n(9). Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a surgical treatment method that involves the implantation of a stimulator by a neurosurgeon or a pain management specialist that works to interfere with pain signals sent to the brain. However, before the stimulator is inserted, a trial run is conducted to test whether the device makes a difference in the type, location, and severity of the afflicted individual’s pain. Spinal cord stimulators come in a variety of forms, but all consist of a pulse generator, a lead wire with electrodes that deliver signals to the spinal cord, and a hand-held remote that allows the user to control the settings. The remote provides control of pulse rate, pulse width (which determines the area of coverage), and pulse amplitude (which correlates to the limit of pain perception). The stimulator works by sending electrical impulses to the spinal cord, where it then interferes with nerve signals being delivered to the brain. Thus, pain perception is either reduced or replaced by a tingling sensation. It should be noted that the procedure is associated with several risks, including cerebrospinal fluid leak, pain at the stimulator site, allergic response, and paralysis below the point of implantation. It can be expected that such risks will be lowered with more research and technological advancement; regardless, the patient and their doctor need to thoroughly analyze all circumstances before proceeding with the surgery.\n\n(10). The social implications of the opioid crisis are equally important when it comes to devising an action plan. There is a misunderstanding about the addictive nature of opioids amongst the general population, so people tend to use them excessively without considering the negative consequences. The fact that opioids are prescribed frequently and in high doses further complicates the situation. The lack of awareness surrounding alternative treatments such as physical therapy also contributes to opioid overuse. Opioids are relatively cheap and accessible for those who are unaware of other options; moreover, the mixing of Fentanyl with illegal drugs makes opioids almost impossible to track, thus making it very difficult to cut the supply at its roots. Other psychological, social, and biological risk factors play a major role in opioid dependence as well. For example, those with genetic predisposition, mental health problems, early life trauma, poverty, and non-secure housing are more susceptible to opioid addiction. Lastly, the stigma around substance abuse discourages individuals from seeking help.\n\n(11). Specific genetic factors that may predispose an individual to opioid addiction include a reduced ability to produce natural pain-relieving chemicals, such as endorphins, or a naturally increased sensitivity to the effects of opioids. A person’s psychology can also play into their propensity for opioid addiction, since individuals with anxiety, depression, or PTSD, for instance, may use opioids as a means of self-medicating. Those who have experienced trauma in early childhood may be especially vulnerable to opioid addiction. If one does not develop healthy coping skills early in life, substances may be used in place of such skills. When it comes to social factors, poverty can make an individual more likely to turn to opioids as a coping mechanism since poverty creates stress, and opioids may be used to help with these stresses. Finally, social stigma may aggravate an already existing addiction, since people may fear discrimination should they seek help.\n\n(12). The appropriate way to manage opioid misuse and abuse has been the subject of discussion for years. Although a lack of consensus on the matter is preventing an action plan from being put into motion, the following are some points that must be addressed. Firstly, awareness should be a cornerstone of the solution; people should be made cognisant of dosage poisoning, which would reduce their risk of accidental overdose. Secondly, preventative measures should also be a significant focus because studies show that the earlier a person is exposed to such substances, the higher the possibility of developing a substance use disorder. An example of this can be seen in Southern Europe, where the legal drinking age is 16. Consequently, teens and young adults in these regions engage more frequently in binge drinking, compared to the same age cohort in North America, where the drinking age is 19 in Canada and 21 in the US. Moreover, we should view addiction as a biological implication rather than a social and moral failure. This notion is supported by evidence that early life experiences can induce chemical changes in the brain, which alter its reward system and stress response; this change of perspective removes the stigma and focuses on marginalized groups. Development of the drug treatment industry and expanding addiction support groups could go a long way in minimizing addictive behaviors. It is time to stop viewing opioid addiction as a human failure and instead tackle the biological reasons behind it."

      "concept_text": "To answer this application question, we should search the passage for the topics mentioned in the answer choices. The first option choice references stem cell therapy, which is discussed in paragraph 8. This tells us that the author WOULD agree that stem cell therapy is the most promising technological advancement for treating pain. It reads: “Furthermore, stem cells have emerged as a promising area of study and research for pain treatment in recent years. Deteriorating tissue that causes pain can be rebuilt into new and healthy tissue by injection of stem cells derived from a patient’s bone marrow into the affected area.” The second answer choice mentions SCS, which is discussed in paragraph 9. This tells us that, due to its many risks, the author would NOT agree that SCS should be the primary choice to treat pain for every person. It reads: “Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a surgical treatment method that involves the implantation of a stimulator by a neurosurgeon or a pain management specialist that works to interfere with pain signals sent to the brain….It should be noted that the procedure is associated with several risks, including cerebrospinal fluid leak, pain at the stimulator site, allergic response, and paralysis below the point of implantation. It can be expected that such risks will be lowered with more research and technological advancement; regardless, the patient and their doctor need to thoroughly analyze all circumstances before proceeding with the surgery.” The third option choice mentions the causes of the opioid crisis, which is discussed in paragraph 10. Based on this statement, the author says that the opioid crisis is the result of numerous factors, not just environmental factors. Thus, the author would disagree with the third option choice. It reads: “Other psychological, social, and biological risk factors play a major role in opioid dependence as well. For example, those with genetic predisposition, mental health problems, early life trauma, poverty and non-secure housing are more susceptible to opioid addiction. Lastly, the stigma around substance abuse discourages individuals from seeking help.” The fourth answer choice references pharmaceutical companies, a topic covered in paragraph 4. This tells us that the author would NOT agree that pharmaceutical companies are blameless. It reads: “The opioid crisis has occurred in three waves. The first wave transpired in the late 1990s when healthcare providers began to prescribe pain relievers at higher rates - this was because pharmaceutical companies claimed that they had minimized the addictive properties of these drugs.” Thus, the only statement that the author would agree with is the first. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. SCS should be the primary choice to treat pain for every individual – is incorrect because in paragraph 9, the author states: “[…] regardless, the patient and their doctor need to thoroughly analyze all circumstances before proceeding with the surgery.” This shows that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is not always the best course of action for an individual. Option C. The opioid crisis is the sole result of environmental factors – is incorrect because in paragraph 10, the author states: “[…] Other psychological, social, and biological risk factors play a major role in opioid dependence as well,” which indicates that the opioid crisis is a result of environmental AND biological factors. Option D. Pharmaceutical companies play no part in the opioid crisis – is incorrect because in paragraph 4, the author states: “[…] healthcare providers began to prescribe pain relievers at higher rates - this was because pharmaceutical companies claimed that they had minimized the addictive properties of these drugs.” This clearly indicates that pharmaceutical companies contributed to the opioid crisis.",

      "text": "(1). The evolution of pharmaceuticals and access to medical care has equipped humans with unprecedented protection against a variety of health problems. However, over the past few decades, the misuse and abuse of prescription drugs have led to a global opioid crisis. The number of deaths due to opioid overdose has been steadily increasing, while opioid poisoning has led to 30% more hospitalizations today compared to a decade ago. In Canada alone, the number of opioid-related deaths surged to approximately 4000 in 2017. The opioid crisis has negative impacts that extend beyond the healthcare sector, as social and economic welfare suffer as well.\n\n(2). Economic effects of the opioid crisis have included an increased burden on the medical system. Healthcare workers have had to devote greater resources to addiction treatment and overdose cases, as well as to those patients suffering from the long-term effects of opioid addiction, such as liver and heart disease. The opioid crisis has had further economic repercussions because those who suffer from opioid addiction may struggle to maintain productivity in the workplace, leading to reduced participation and, as the addiction worsens, disability claims. Social welfare is impacted because in areas where opioid addiction is prevalent, there may be higher rates of financial hardship amongst families, generational poverty, and social upheaval for children of addicted parents. As such, the demand for social services and foster care placements increases, as does the demand on police forces, since resources must be allocated toward issues such as drug trafficking.\n\n(3).

Spinal cord stimulators come in a variety of forms, but all consist of a pulse generator, a lead wire with electrodes that deliver signals to the spinal cord, and a hand-held remote that allows the user to control the settings. The remote provides control of pulse rate, pulse width (which determines the area of coverage), and pulse amplitude (which correlates to the limit of pain perception). The stimulator works by sending electrical impulses to the spinal cord, where it then interferes with nerve signals being delivered to the brain. Thus, pain perception is either reduced or replaced by a tingling sensation. It should be noted that the procedure is associated with several risks, including cerebrospinal fluid leak, pain at the stimulator site, allergic response, and paralysis below the point of implantation. It can be expected that such risks will be lowered with more research and technological advancement; regardless, the patient and their doctor need to thoroughly analyze all circumstances before proceeding with the surgery.\n\n(10). The social implications of the opioid crisis are equally important when it comes to devising an action plan. There is a misunderstanding about the addictive nature of opioids amongst the general population, so people tend to use them excessively without considering the negative consequences. The fact that opioids are prescribed frequently and in high doses further complicates the situation. The lack of awareness surrounding alternative treatments such as physical therapy also contributes to opioid overuse. Opioids are relatively cheap and accessible for those who are unaware of other options; moreover, the mixing of Fentanyl with illegal drugs makes opioids almost impossible to track, thus making it very difficult to cut the supply at its roots. Other psychological, social, and biological risk factors play a major role in opioid dependence as well. For example, those with genetic predisposition, mental health problems, early life trauma, poverty, and non-secure housing are more susceptible to opioid addiction. Lastly, the stigma around substance abuse discourages individuals from seeking help.\n\n(11). Specific genetic factors that may predispose an individual to opioid addiction include a reduced ability to produce natural pain-relieving chemicals, such as endorphins, or a naturally increased sensitivity to the effects of opioids. A person’s psychology can also play into their propensity for opioid addiction, since individuals with anxiety, depression, or PTSD, for instance, may use opioids as a means of self-medicating. Those who have experienced trauma in early childhood may be especially vulnerable to opioid addiction. If one does not develop healthy coping skills early in life, substances may be used in place of such skills. When it comes to social factors, poverty can make an individual more likely to turn to opioids as a coping mechanism since poverty creates stress, and opioids may be used to help with these stresses. Finally, social stigma may aggravate an already existing addiction, since people may fear discrimination should they seek help.\n\n(12). The appropriate way to manage opioid misuse and abuse has been the subject of discussion for years. Although a lack of consensus on the matter is preventing an action plan from being put into motion, the following are some points that must be addressed. Firstly, awareness should be a cornerstone of the solution; people should be made cognisant of dosage poisoning, which would reduce their risk of accidental overdose. Secondly, preventative measures should also be a significant focus because studies show that the earlier a person is exposed to such substances, the higher the possibility of developing a substance use disorder. An example of this can be seen in Southern Europe, where the legal drinking age is 16. Consequently, teens and young adults in these regions engage more frequently in binge drinking, compared to the same age cohort in North America, where the drinking age is 19 in Canada and 21 in the US. Moreover, we should view addiction as a biological implication rather than a social and moral failure. This notion is supported by evidence that early life experiences can induce chemical changes in the brain, which alter its reward system and stress response; this change of perspective removes the stigma and focuses on marginalized groups. Development of the drug treatment industry and expanding addiction support groups could go a long way in minimizing addictive behaviors. It is time to stop viewing opioid addiction as a human failure and instead tackle the biological reasons behind it."

They can produce feelings of euphoria or a \"high,\" which is the reason they are so addictive...” This tells us that the statement AND reason are correct and related. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",

Dopamine causes a person to want to recreate the effects of the opioid, and thus, they are addictive. This is mentioned more specifically in paragraph 3. Option C. The statement is correct, but the reason is NOT – is incorrect because the reason is also correct. In paragraph 3, the author writes “[…] they block pain signals sent from the body and release dopamine, causing the person to want to recreate the effects.” Option D. The statement is NOT correct, but the reason is correct – is incorrect because the statement is also correct. In paragraph 3, the author states: “Opioids are a class of drugs used to reduce pain and improve function.” Option E. NEITHER the statement NOR the reason is correct – is incorrect because both the statement and the reason are correct and related.

      "text": "(1). The evolution of pharmaceuticals and access to medical care has equipped humans with unprecedented protection against a variety of health problems. However, over the past few decades, the misuse and abuse of prescription drugs have led to a global opioid crisis. The number of deaths due to opioid overdose has been steadily increasing, while opioid poisoning has led to 30% more hospitalizations today compared to a decade ago. In Canada alone, the number of opioid-related deaths surged to approximately 4000 in 2017. The opioid crisis has negative impacts that extend beyond the healthcare sector, as social and economic welfare suffer as well.\n\n(2). Economic effects of the opioid crisis have included an increased burden on the medical system. Healthcare workers have had to devote greater resources to addiction treatment and overdose cases, as well as to those patients suffering from the long-term effects of opioid addiction, such as liver and heart disease. The opioid crisis has had further economic repercussions because those who suffer from opioid addiction may struggle to maintain productivity in the workplace, leading to reduced participation and, as the addiction worsens, disability claims. Social welfare is impacted because in areas where opioid addiction is prevalent, there may be higher rates of financial hardship amongst families, generational poverty, and social upheaval for children of addicted parents. As such, the demand for social services and foster care placements increases, as does the demand on police forces, since resources must be allocated toward issues such as drug trafficking.\n\n(3). Opioids are a class of drugs used to reduce pain and improve function. They can produce feelings of euphoria or a “high,” which is the reason they are so addictive. Opioids bind to cells located in parts of the brain, spinal cord, and other organs in the body, especially those involved in sensing pain and pleasure - by attaching to these receptors, they block pain signals sent from the body and release dopamine, causing the person to want to recreate the effects of the drug.\n\n(4). The opioid crisis has occurred in three waves. The first wave transpired in the late 1990s when healthcare providers began to prescribe pain relievers at higher rates - this was because pharmaceutical companies claimed that they had minimized the addictive properties of these drugs. Some common prescription pain relievers include oxycodone, hydrocode, codeine, and morphine. Communities, where opioids were readily available and prescribed liberally, were the first to experience abuse and diversion; as a result, the use of prescription drugs became more widespread locally, mainly among friends and family.\n\n(5). The second wave was caused by heroin abuse. Heroin is made from the natural substance morphine, which is taken from the seed pod of various opium poppy plants grown in Southeast Asia, Mexico, and Colombia. When regulations on prescription drugs made them harder to obtain, heroin presented itself as a cheap, widely available, and powerful opioid. Heroin is commonly injected, which increases the risk for injection-related diseases such as HIV/AIDS, HEP B&C, skin, bloodstream, and heart infections.\n\n(6). The third wave of the opioid crisis was caused by Fentanyl, which is possibly the deadliest of all opioids. Originally used as a surgical anesthetic and a potent pain reliever, Fentanyl has recently been synthesized in illegal labs and sold as a street drug or, alternatively, mixed with drugs like cocaine to bolster profits. Fentanyl can be found in tablets or powder form; these increase the risk of overdose since people are unaware of the nature of the substance and its dosage. More than 70% of opioid-related deaths in 2017 were attributed to fentanyl or its analogues. Troublingly, there are no visible indicators that fentanyl has been mixed with another drug because it cannot be smelled, seen, or tasted. As such, it is vital to select a trustworthy provider when acquiring prescription drugs, since fentanyl can be lethal even in small doses. A fentanyl overdose can be identified through slowed or absent breathing, blue coloration of lips or fingertips, lack of consciousness and pinpoint pupils.\n\n(7). Although opioids are effective as pain-relievers, there are alternative treatments for pain relief that can be just as useful. Over-the-counter or prescribed non-opioid medications such as ibuprofen (Motrin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin (Bayer), and steroids are reported to be enough for patients’ needs. Additionally, physical therapy through an exercise program created by a licensed physiotherapist can help reduce pain and improve function. Such a program can include components of whirlpools and deep-tissue massages to accelerate healing. Acupuncture is another treatment that involves the use of thin needles inserted at various areas of the skin to block pain signals. Alternatively, injections with localized anesthetics can decrease muscle spasms and nerve pain. If none of the above treatment methods prove useful, surgery is the last resort that can make a difference in cases where a bodily irregularity is the root of the pain. Despite the established clinical benefit of these methods, technology has given way to even more innovative approaches to treating pain.\n\n(8). Technology is developing faster than ever before and, consequently, modern treatment methods are quickly emerging. In radio wave-targeted pain removal, a needle is inserted next to the nerve responsible for pain; next, the electrical currents created by radio waves are used to burn the nerve. In turn, this causes the pain signal to short-circuit and thus remain unsensed for up to one year. Electrical signals can be used in a similar way, but their exact method of action is not as clearly understood. These signals are used for short-term relief from muscle pain, where pods attached to the skin deliver low-voltage electrical signals from an external source. Scientists believe the signals play a role in interrupting nerve-brain communication, or act by releasing the body’s natural painkillers. Furthermore, stem cells have emerged as a promising area of study and research for pain treatment in recent years. Deteriorating tissue that causes pain can be rebuilt into new and healthy tissue by injection of stem cells derived from a patient’s bone marrow into the affected area.\n\n(9). Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a surgical treatment method that involves the implantation of a stimulator by a neurosurgeon or a pain management specialist that works to interfere with pain signals sent to the brain. However, before the stimulator is inserted, a trial run is conducted to test whether the device makes a difference in the type, location, and severity of the afflicted individual’s pain.

As such, it is vital to select a trustworthy provider when acquiring prescription drugs, since fentanyl can be lethal even in small doses.” Since fentanyl is so difficult to detect when mixed, this would not be the best tactic. Additionally, there would be several sources of fentanyl-mixed street drugs, so, once more, this would not be the most effective strategy. Option C.

      "title": "Passage 1",
      "text": "(1). The evolution of pharmaceuticals and access to medical care has equipped humans with unprecedented protection against a variety of health problems. However, over the past few decades, the misuse and abuse of prescription drugs have led to a global opioid crisis. The number of deaths due to opioid overdose has been steadily increasing, while opioid poisoning has led to 30% more hospitalizations today compared to a decade ago. In Canada alone, the number of opioid-related deaths surged to approximately 4000 in 2017. The opioid crisis has negative impacts that extend beyond the healthcare sector, as social and economic welfare suffer as well.\n\n(2). Economic effects of the opioid crisis have included an increased burden on the medical system. Healthcare workers have had to devote greater resources to addiction treatment and overdose cases, as well as to those patients suffering from the long-term effects of opioid addiction, such as liver and heart disease. The opioid crisis has had further economic repercussions because those who suffer from opioid addiction may struggle to maintain productivity in the workplace, leading to reduced participation and, as the addiction worsens, disability claims. Social welfare is impacted because in areas where opioid addiction is prevalent, there may be higher rates of financial hardship amongst families, generational poverty, and social upheaval for children of addicted parents. As such, the demand for social services and foster care placements increases, as does the demand on police forces, since resources must be allocated toward issues such as drug trafficking.\n\n(3). Opioids are a class of drugs used to reduce pain and improve function. They can produce feelings of euphoria or a “high,” which is the reason they are so addictive. Opioids bind to cells located in parts of the brain, spinal cord, and other organs in the body, especially those involved in sensing pain and pleasure - by attaching to these receptors, they block pain signals sent from the body and release dopamine, causing the person to want to recreate the effects of the drug.\n\n(4). The opioid crisis has occurred in three waves. The first wave transpired in the late 1990s when healthcare providers began to prescribe pain relievers at higher rates - this was because pharmaceutical companies claimed that they had minimized the addictive properties of these drugs. Some common prescription pain relievers include oxycodone, hydrocode, codeine, and morphine. Communities, where opioids were readily available and prescribed liberally, were the first to experience abuse and diversion; as a result, the use of prescription drugs became more widespread locally, mainly among friends and family.\n\n(5). The second wave was caused by heroin abuse. Heroin is made from the natural substance morphine, which is taken from the seed pod of various opium poppy plants grown in Southeast Asia, Mexico, and Colombia. When regulations on prescription drugs made them harder to obtain, heroin presented itself as a cheap, widely available, and powerful opioid. Heroin is commonly injected, which increases the risk for injection-related diseases such as HIV/AIDS, HEP B&C, skin, bloodstream, and heart infections.\n\n(6). The third wave of the opioid crisis was caused by Fentanyl, which is possibly the deadliest of all opioids. Originally used as a surgical anesthetic and a potent pain reliever, Fentanyl has recently been synthesized in illegal labs and sold as a street drug or, alternatively, mixed with drugs like cocaine to bolster profits. Fentanyl can be found in tablets or powder form; these increase the risk of overdose since people are unaware of the nature of the substance and its dosage. More than 70% of opioid-related deaths in 2017 were attributed to fentanyl or its analogues. Troublingly, there are no visible indicators that fentanyl has been mixed with another drug because it cannot be smelled, seen, or tasted. As such, it is vital to select a trustworthy provider when acquiring prescription drugs, since fentanyl can be lethal even in small doses. A fentanyl overdose can be identified through slowed or absent breathing, blue coloration of lips or fingertips, lack of consciousness and pinpoint pupils.\n\n(7). Although opioids are effective as pain-relievers, there are alternative treatments for pain relief that can be just as useful. Over-the-counter or prescribed non-opioid medications such as ibuprofen (Motrin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin (Bayer), and steroids are reported to be enough for patients’ needs. Additionally, physical therapy through an exercise program created by a licensed physiotherapist can help reduce pain and improve function. Such a program can include components of whirlpools and deep-tissue massages to accelerate healing. Acupuncture is another treatment that involves the use of thin needles inserted at various areas of the skin to block pain signals. Alternatively, injections with localized anesthetics can decrease muscle spasms and nerve pain. If none of the above treatment methods prove useful, surgery is the last resort that can make a difference in cases where a bodily irregularity is the root of the pain. Despite the established clinical benefit of these methods, technology has given way to even more innovative approaches to treating pain.\n\n(8). Technology is developing faster than ever before and, consequently, modern treatment methods are quickly emerging. In radio wave-targeted pain removal, a needle is inserted next to the nerve responsible for pain; next, the electrical currents created by radio waves are used to burn the nerve. In turn, this causes the pain signal to short-circuit and thus remain unsensed for up to one year. Electrical signals can be used in a similar way, but their exact method of action is not as clearly understood. These signals are used for short-term relief from muscle pain, where pods attached to the skin deliver low-voltage electrical signals from an external source. Scientists believe the signals play a role in interrupting nerve-brain communication, or act by releasing the body’s natural painkillers. Furthermore, stem cells have emerged as a promising area of study and research for pain treatment in recent years. Deteriorating tissue that causes pain can be rebuilt into new and healthy tissue by injection of stem cells derived from a patient’s bone marrow into the affected area.\n\n(9). Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a surgical treatment method that involves the implantation of a stimulator by a neurosurgeon or a pain management specialist that works to interfere with pain signals sent to the brain. However, before the stimulator is inserted, a trial run is conducted to test whether the device makes a difference in the type, location, and severity of the afflicted individual’s pain. Spinal cord stimulators come in a variety of forms, but all consist of a pulse generator, a lead wire with electrodes that deliver signals to the spinal cord, and a hand-held remote that allows the user to control the settings. The remote provides control of pulse rate, pulse width (which determines the area of coverage), and pulse amplitude (which correlates to the limit of pain perception). The stimulator works by sending electrical impulses to the spinal cord, where it then interferes with nerve signals being delivered to the brain. Thus, pain perception is either reduced or replaced by a tingling sensation. It should be noted that the procedure is associated with several risks, including cerebrospinal fluid leak, pain at the stimulator site, allergic response, and paralysis below the point of implantation. It can be expected that such risks will be lowered with more research and technological advancement; regardless, the patient and their doctor need to thoroughly analyze all circumstances before proceeding with the surgery.\n\n(10). The social implications of the opioid crisis are equally important when it comes to devising an action plan. There is a misunderstanding about the addictive nature of opioids amongst the general population, so people tend to use them excessively without considering the negative consequences. The fact that opioids are prescribed frequently and in high doses further complicates the situation. The lack of awareness surrounding alternative treatments such as physical therapy also contributes to opioid overuse. Opioids are relatively cheap and accessible for those who are unaware of other options; moreover, the mixing of Fentanyl with illegal drugs makes opioids almost impossible to track, thus making it very difficult to cut the supply at its roots. Other psychological, social, and biological risk factors play a major role in opioid dependence as well. For example, those with genetic predisposition, mental health problems, early life trauma, poverty, and non-secure housing are more susceptible to opioid addiction. Lastly, the stigma around substance abuse discourages individuals from seeking help.\n\n(11). Specific genetic factors that may predispose an individual to opioid addiction include a reduced ability to produce natural pain-relieving chemicals, such as endorphins, or a naturally increased sensitivity to the effects of opioids. A person’s psychology can also play into their propensity for opioid addiction, since individuals with anxiety, depression, or PTSD, for instance, may use opioids as a means of self-medicating. Those who have experienced trauma in early childhood may be especially vulnerable to opioid addiction. If one does not develop healthy coping skills early in life, substances may be used in place of such skills. When it comes to social factors, poverty can make an individual more likely to turn to opioids as a coping mechanism since poverty creates stress, and opioids may be used to help with these stresses. Finally, social stigma may aggravate an already existing addiction, since people may fear discrimination should they seek help.\n\n(12). The appropriate way to manage opioid misuse and abuse has been the subject of discussion for years. Although a lack of consensus on the matter is preventing an action plan from being put into motion, the following are some points that must be addressed. Firstly, awareness should be a cornerstone of the solution; people should be made cognisant of dosage poisoning, which would reduce their risk of accidental overdose. Secondly, preventative measures should also be a significant focus because studies show that the earlier a person is exposed to such substances, the higher the possibility of developing a substance use disorder. An example of this can be seen in Southern Europe, where the legal drinking age is 16. Consequently, teens and young adults in these regions engage more frequently in binge drinking, compared to the same age cohort in North America, where the drinking age is 19 in Canada and 21 in the US. Moreover, we should view addiction as a biological implication rather than a social and moral failure. This notion is supported by evidence that early life experiences can induce chemical changes in the brain, which alter its reward system and stress response; this change of perspective removes the stigma and focuses on marginalized groups. Development of the drug treatment industry and expanding addiction support groups could go a long way in minimizing addictive behaviors. It is time to stop viewing opioid addiction as a human failure and instead tackle the biological reasons behind it."

Originally used as a surgical anesthetic and a potent pain reliever, Fentanyl has recently been synthesized in illegal labs and sold as a street drug or, alternatively, mixed with drugs like cocaine to bolster profits. Fentanyl can be found in tablets or powder form; these increase the risk of overdose since people are unaware of the nature of the substance and its dosage. More than 70% of opioid-related deaths in 2017 were attributed to fentanyl or its analogues. Troublingly, there are no visible indicators that fentanyl has been mixed with another drug because it cannot be smelled, seen, or tasted. As such, it is vital to select a trustworthy provider when acquiring prescription drugs, since fentanyl can be lethal even in small doses. A fentanyl overdose can be identified through slowed or absent breathing, blue coloration of lips or fingertips, lack of consciousness and pinpoint pupils.\n\n(7). Although opioids are effective as pain-relievers, there are alternative treatments for pain relief that can be just as useful. Over-the-counter or prescribed non-opioid medications such as ibuprofen (Motrin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin (Bayer), and steroids are reported to be enough for patients’ needs. Additionally, physical therapy through an exercise program created by a licensed physiotherapist can help reduce pain and improve function. Such a program can include components of whirlpools and deep-tissue massages to accelerate healing. Acupuncture is another treatment that involves the use of thin needles inserted at various areas of the skin to block pain signals. Alternatively, injections with localized anesthetics can decrease muscle spasms and nerve pain. If none of the above treatment methods prove useful, surgery is the last resort that can make a difference in cases where a bodily irregularity is the root of the pain. Despite the established clinical benefit of these methods, technology has given way to even more innovative approaches to treating pain.\n\n(8). Technology is developing faster than ever before and, consequently, modern treatment methods are quickly emerging. In radio wave-targeted pain removal, a needle is inserted next to the nerve responsible for pain; next, the electrical currents created by radio waves are used to burn the nerve. In turn, this causes the pain signal to short-circuit and thus remain unsensed for up to one year. Electrical signals can be used in a similar way, but their exact method of action is not as clearly understood. These signals are used for short-term relief from muscle pain, where pods attached to the skin deliver low-voltage electrical signals from an external source. Scientists believe the signals play a role in interrupting nerve-brain communication, or act by releasing the body’s natural painkillers. Furthermore, stem cells have emerged as a promising area of study and research for pain treatment in recent years. Deteriorating tissue that causes pain can be rebuilt into new and healthy tissue by injection of stem cells derived from a patient’s bone marrow into the affected area.\n\n(9). Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a surgical treatment method that involves the implantation of a stimulator by a neurosurgeon or a pain management specialist that works to interfere with pain signals sent to the brain. However, before the stimulator is inserted, a trial run is conducted to test whether the device makes a difference in the type, location, and severity of the afflicted individual’s pain. Spinal cord stimulators come in a variety of forms, but all consist of a pulse generator, a lead wire with electrodes that deliver signals to the spinal cord, and a hand-held remote that allows the user to control the settings. The remote provides control of pulse rate, pulse width (which determines the area of coverage), and pulse amplitude (which correlates to the limit of pain perception). The stimulator works by sending electrical impulses to the spinal cord, where it then interferes with nerve signals being delivered to the brain. Thus, pain perception is either reduced or replaced by a tingling sensation. It should be noted that the procedure is associated with several risks, including cerebrospinal fluid leak, pain at the stimulator site, allergic response, and paralysis below the point of implantation. It can be expected that such risks will be lowered with more research and technological advancement; regardless, the patient and their doctor need to thoroughly analyze all circumstances before proceeding with the surgery.\n\n(10). The social implications of the opioid crisis are equally important when it comes to devising an action plan. There is a misunderstanding about the addictive nature of opioids amongst the general population, so people tend to use them excessively without considering the negative consequences. The fact that opioids are prescribed frequently and in high doses further complicates the situation. The lack of awareness surrounding alternative treatments such as physical therapy also contributes to opioid overuse. Opioids are relatively cheap and accessible for those who are unaware of other options; moreover, the mixing of Fentanyl with illegal drugs makes opioids almost impossible to track, thus making it very difficult to cut the supply at its roots. Other psychological, social, and biological risk factors play a major role in opioid dependence as well. For example, those with genetic predisposition, mental health problems, early life trauma, poverty, and non-secure housing are more susceptible to opioid addiction. Lastly, the stigma around substance abuse discourages individuals from seeking help.\n\n(11). Specific genetic factors that may predispose an individual to opioid addiction include a reduced ability to produce natural pain-relieving chemicals, such as endorphins, or a naturally increased sensitivity to the effects of opioids. A person’s psychology can also play into their propensity for opioid addiction, since individuals with anxiety, depression, or PTSD, for instance, may use opioids as a means of self-medicating. Those who have experienced trauma in early childhood may be especially vulnerable to opioid addiction. If one does not develop healthy coping skills early in life, substances may be used in place of such skills. When it comes to social factors, poverty can make an individual more likely to turn to opioids as a coping mechanism since poverty creates stress, and opioids may be used to help with these stresses. Finally, social stigma may aggravate an already existing addiction, since people may fear discrimination should they seek help.\n\n(12). The appropriate way to manage opioid misuse and abuse has been the subject of discussion for years. Although a lack of consensus on the matter is preventing an action plan from being put into motion, the following are some points that must be addressed. Firstly, awareness should be a cornerstone of the solution; people should be made cognisant of dosage poisoning, which would reduce their risk of accidental overdose. Secondly, preventative measures should also be a significant focus because studies show that the earlier a person is exposed to such substances, the higher the possibility of developing a substance use disorder. An example of this can be seen in Southern Europe, where the legal drinking age is 16. Consequently, teens and young adults in these regions engage more frequently in binge drinking, compared to the same age cohort in North America, where the drinking age is 19 in Canada and 21 in the US. Moreover, we should view addiction as a biological implication rather than a social and moral failure. This notion is supported by evidence that early life experiences can induce chemical changes in the brain, which alter its reward system and stress response; this change of perspective removes the stigma and focuses on marginalized groups. Development of the drug treatment industry and expanding addiction support groups could go a long way in minimizing addictive behaviors. It is time to stop viewing opioid addiction as a human failure and instead tackle the biological reasons behind it."

      "text": "(1). The evolution of pharmaceuticals and access to medical care has equipped humans with unprecedented protection against a variety of health problems. However, over the past few decades, the misuse and abuse of prescription drugs have led to a global opioid crisis. The number of deaths due to opioid overdose has been steadily increasing, while opioid poisoning has led to 30% more hospitalizations today compared to a decade ago. In Canada alone, the number of opioid-related deaths surged to approximately 4000 in 2017. The opioid crisis has negative impacts that extend beyond the healthcare sector, as social and economic welfare suffer as well.\n\n(2). Economic effects of the opioid crisis have included an increased burden on the medical system. Healthcare workers have had to devote greater resources to addiction treatment and overdose cases, as well as to those patients suffering from the long-term effects of opioid addiction, such as liver and heart disease. The opioid crisis has had further economic repercussions because those who suffer from opioid addiction may struggle to maintain productivity in the workplace, leading to reduced participation and, as the addiction worsens, disability claims. Social welfare is impacted because in areas where opioid addiction is prevalent, there may be higher rates of financial hardship amongst families, generational poverty, and social upheaval for children of addicted parents. As such, the demand for social services and foster care placements increases, as does the demand on police forces, since resources must be allocated toward issues such as drug trafficking.\n\n(3). Opioids are a class of drugs used to reduce pain and improve function. They can produce feelings of euphoria or a “high,” which is the reason they are so addictive. Opioids bind to cells located in parts of the brain, spinal cord, and other organs in the body, especially those involved in sensing pain and pleasure - by attaching to these receptors, they block pain signals sent from the body and release dopamine, causing the person to want to recreate the effects of the drug.\n\n(4). The opioid crisis has occurred in three waves. The first wave transpired in the late 1990s when healthcare providers began to prescribe pain relievers at higher rates - this was because pharmaceutical companies claimed that they had minimized the addictive properties of these drugs. Some common prescription pain relievers include oxycodone, hydrocode, codeine, and morphine. Communities, where opioids were readily available and prescribed liberally, were the first to experience abuse and diversion; as a result, the use of prescription drugs became more widespread locally, mainly among friends and family.\n\n(5). The second wave was caused by heroin abuse. Heroin is made from the natural substance morphine, which is taken from the seed pod of various opium poppy plants grown in Southeast Asia, Mexico, and Colombia. When regulations on prescription drugs made them harder to obtain, heroin presented itself as a cheap, widely available, and powerful opioid. Heroin is commonly injected, which increases the risk for injection-related diseases such as HIV/AIDS, HEP B&C, skin, bloodstream, and heart infections.\n\n(6). The third wave of the opioid crisis was caused by Fentanyl, which is possibly the deadliest of all opioids. Originally used as a surgical anesthetic and a potent pain reliever, Fentanyl has recently been synthesized in illegal labs and sold as a street drug or, alternatively, mixed with drugs like cocaine to bolster profits. Fentanyl can be found in tablets or powder form; these increase the risk of overdose since people are unaware of the nature of the substance and its dosage. More than 70% of opioid-related deaths in 2017 were attributed to fentanyl or its analogues. Troublingly, there are no visible indicators that fentanyl has been mixed with another drug because it cannot be smelled, seen, or tasted. As such, it is vital to select a trustworthy provider when acquiring prescription drugs, since fentanyl can be lethal even in small doses. A fentanyl overdose can be identified through slowed or absent breathing, blue coloration of lips or fingertips, lack of consciousness and pinpoint pupils.\n\n(7). Although opioids are effective as pain-relievers, there are alternative treatments for pain relief that can be just as useful. Over-the-counter or prescribed non-opioid medications such as ibuprofen (Motrin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin (Bayer), and steroids are reported to be enough for patients’ needs.

Finally, social stigma may aggravate an already existing addiction, since people may fear discrimination should they seek help.\n\n(12). The appropriate way to manage opioid misuse and abuse has been the subject of discussion for years. Although a lack of consensus on the matter is preventing an action plan from being put into motion, the following are some points that must be addressed. Firstly, awareness should be a cornerstone of the solution; people should be made cognisant of dosage poisoning, which would reduce their risk of accidental overdose. Secondly, preventative measures should also be a significant focus because studies show that the earlier a person is exposed to such substances, the higher the possibility of developing a substance use disorder. An example of this can be seen in Southern Europe, where the legal drinking age is 16. Consequently, teens and young adults in these regions engage more frequently in binge drinking, compared to the same age cohort in North America, where the drinking age is 19 in Canada and 21 in the US. Moreover, we should view addiction as a biological implication rather than a social and moral failure. This notion is supported by evidence that early life experiences can induce chemical changes in the brain, which alter its reward system and stress response; this change of perspective removes the stigma and focuses on marginalized groups. Development of the drug treatment industry and expanding addiction support groups could go a long way in minimizing addictive behaviors. It is time to stop viewing opioid addiction as a human failure and instead tackle the biological reasons behind it."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should first locate the paragraph that mentions the legal drinking age in Southern Europe. This topic is covered in the final paragraph of the passage: “Firstly, awareness should be a cornerstone of the solution; people should be made cognisant of dosage poisoning, which would reduce their risk of accidental overdose. Secondly, preventative measures should also be a significant focus because studies show that the earlier a person is exposed to such substances, the higher the possibility of developing a substance use disorder. An example of this can be seen in Southern Europe, where the legal drinking age is 16. Consequently, teens and young adults in these regions engage more frequently in binge-drinking, compared to the same age cohort in North America, where the drinking age is 19 in Canada and 21 in the US.” Next, we should note that the author uses the example of the early drinking age in Europe to show the increased vulnerability of youth in this area to substance abuse. This bolsters the argument that, if the drinking age in an area is increased, fewer individuals are expected to engage in such behavior. Thus, the author conveys the message that implementing regulations limiting access to substances is a prevention measure against substance abuse and addiction. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. They demonstrate the commonality of alcohol abuse amongst the youth – is incorrect because in the first sentences of the paragraph that discusses this, the author notes that preventative measures should be a significant focus, such as with having a higher drinking age. Discussing the commonality of alcohol abuse in parallel to the opioid crisis would not add much to the argument. Option B. They emphasize the importance of increasing the drinking age to control alcoholism – is incorrect because, while this may be true, it is not the main reason this example is mentioned. The author uses the example of the low drinking age in Europe to show the increased vulnerability of these persons to substance abuse. If the drinking age is increased, fewer individuals are expected to engage in such behavior. Implementing regulations that limit access as a prevention measure is what the author is arguing for with the opioid crisis. Option C. They argue that the opioid crisis stems from lax drug accessibility restrictions – is incorrect because, while this may be true, this is not the main reason this example is mentioned. The author uses the example of the low drinking age in Europe to show the increased vulnerability of these persons to substance abuse. If the drinking age is increased, fewer individuals are expected to engage in such behavior. This is not the same as highlighting that the crisis is caused by poor restrictions.

      "text": "(1). Addiction occurs when one continually craves and engages in consuming a certain drug or activity, despite the detrimental consequences. It is a chronic disease that can change both brain structure and function, potentially involving substances such as alcohol, inhalants, opioids, cocaine, nicotine, or tobacco, or even behaviors such as excessive eating, shopping, exercising, technology use, and more. Although recovery from addiction is often a slow and complex process, it is very possible.\n\n(2). The initial consumption of an addictive substance or activity is usually voluntary; however, repeated offenses can lead to physiological changes, which can alter a person’s self-control and ability to resist a given substance. Hence, addiction can switch from a liking to an unwavering wanting. Globally, substance abuse accounts for 190,000 untimely deaths per year. Specifically, North America endures the greatest drug-related mortality rate (about one in four individuals worldwide, and one hundred individuals daily in the United States alone). Everyone can suffer from the harmful effects of addiction, including babies exposed to drugs prenatally, teenagers, adults, and even seniors.\n\n(3). Long-term effects of prolonged drug use can lead to other medical conditions, such as lung or cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, and mental disorders. Addiction to tobacco, for example, can cause cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx, blood, pancreas, kidney, bladder, and/or cervix. At times, mental illness and addiction occur in conjunction with each other; mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression or schizophrenia can be present before addiction, and other times can worsen or trigger a mental disorder. In fact, those who partake in substance abuse are three times more likely to have a mental illness.\n\n(4). Many factors can increase the likelihood of addiction. The more risk factors one has, the more he or she is inclined to fall prey to drug addiction. Biology, environment, and development are all crucial contributors to the disease. According to a twin and adoption study, 40% to 60% of susceptibility to addiction is genetic. Furthermore, varying brain characteristics between individuals can make one person more prone to the disease than another. Other biological factors that affect drug use and dependence include gender, ethnicity, and the presence of mental illness. In terms of environmental factors, these can include peer pressure, stress, substance abuse in family and friends, lack of parental guidance, easy access to substances, pop culture encouragement of drug use, and exposure to physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. Lastly, development entails age - addiction can occur at any age, but the earlier an addictive habit begins, the higher the chance it will progress into a chronic disease.\n\n(5). A sign of addiction is using a substance or engaging in a specific activity for long periods, more than recommended. Other indicators include a lack of desire or effort to decrease use, intense cravings, and disturbances caused in one’s work, home, or social life. A further red flag is when an addictive behavior continues despite the physical and physiological harm it causes, on top of social and interpersonal consequences. Furthermore, when someone invests significant time either participating in, or recovering from, addictive behavior, it is a sign of addiction. The severity of the addiction is judged by how many of these indicators are present.\n\n(6). Pleasure in the brain is characterized by the release of dopamine into the accumbens. The hippocampus then stores this, the amygdala creates a conditioned response, and the prefrontal cortex organizes the information. The nucleus accumbens, also known as the reward center, are nerve cells located underneath the cerebral cortex; when food and water are consumed, for example, this reward system is activated, causing the release of dopamine. This pleasurable feeling ensures behaviors are repeated. The more rewarding an activity is, the more probable it is that one will remember and repeat it. How addictive a substance or activity will be is dependent on the speed, intensity, and reliability of the dopamine release. In drug use specifically, the route of entry plays a key role. For instance, consuming a drug intravenously rather than in pill form will yield a stronger and speedier dopamine signal, thus increasing the chance of addiction.\n\n(7). Like a bad habit, addiction can be difficult to quit. At the point that one decides to walk on a path of sobriety, cravings will be imminent. Merely thinking about engaging in an addictive activity can create a sensation of pleasure within an addict, making moving on much more challenging. Certain environmental cues in one’s surroundings can either initiate or exacerbate cravings, potentially triggering a relapse. Examples of environmental cues include a person, place, activity, or even a specific time. The brain forms a positive memory with drug use or an addictive activity and then incorporates the cues present into the narrative. As addictive behaviors increase in number, the association of cues to the addictive behavior is compounded. In addition to positive memories, negative memories can also lead to cravings. For example, feelings of withdrawal can cause emotional or physical distress; therefore, re-engaging in an addictive behavior would be due to withdrawal avoidance. A significant part of treatment is to ensure that cues do not trigger cravings or relapse.\n\n(8). Addiction causes changes in the brain by altering the prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is responsible for reasonable and logical decision-making in daily life. Damage to the prefrontal cortex because of addiction causes impulsivity and compulsivity - impulsivity is when one acts on a sudden desire or urge without thinking it through or considering the consequences, while compulsivity is behavior that is driven by the need to relieve anxiety. Therefore, once an addictive behavior is practiced, the distress and anxiety go away. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex plays a role in other processes; as such, damaging it affects memory, emotion, and stress regulation in the brain, as well as the brain’s reward system. Addiction also causes loss of rational thought, meaning that an afflicted individual will incorrectly weigh the pros and cons of their decisions. When one realizes that the costs of addictive behavior outweigh the benefits, they are more likely to reach sobriety.\n\n(9). Addiction does not have to be permanent, and recovery is very possible. Entirely ceasing to use or participate in addictive activities can potentially reverse many of the negative physical changes that have occurred in the brain. Furthermore, using combination therapies can aid with recovery from the physiological effects caused by addiction and diverting cravings by partaking in alternate activities can promote healing. The brain is highly adaptable, and every step made in the right direction can have a positive effect on it.\n\n(10). There are three principles that guide our understanding of addiction and treatment - these are learning, cognitive, and behavioral theory. Learning theory helps us comprehend how unhealthy behaviors are learned, and how they can be unlearned to promote recovery, whilst cognitive theory covers how one’s thoughts, emotions, and expectations lead to addiction; by modifying thoughts, one can be treated. Lastly, behavioral theory looks at addiction as a form of stunted development. Using psychotherapy to encourage growth and development is another way to generate a positive outcome.\n\n(11). For treatment to be successful, an individual must have humility and motivation, find meaning in their life, and be committed to the sustained effort of staying sober. Treatment for addiction can be undertaken by the individual, or it can extend to the care of professionals. Usually, addicts try to recover on their own, but when they feel they need help, they turn to treatment. Knowing when to ask for help and being able to do so is humility, while motivation is when one realizes that the cost of participating in addictive behavior is greater than the benefits. As not everyone has this amount of clarity, a significant part of treatment is being able to correctly assess a situation and consider the pros and cons. Sustained effort means to continue pursuing one’s goals of sobriety and maintain self-restraint, despite the discomfort of withdrawals. Lastly, one must find purpose in their life; when a person becomes an addict, participating in an addictive behavior becomes all-consuming. Thus, for treatment to be successful, individuals must find something meaningful that they are passionate about to replace their addictive behaviors. Examples include going to the gym, spending more time with family, or even volunteering. It is crucial for one to keep busy by doing the things they truly enjoy so that they do not fall back into their old ways."

Other indicators include a lack of desire or effort to decrease use, intense cravings, and disturbances caused in one’s work, home, or social life. A further red flag is when an addictive behavior continues despite the physical and physiological harm it causes, on top of social and interpersonal consequences. Furthermore, when someone invests significant time either participating in, or recovering from, addictive behavior, it is a sign of addiction. The severity of the addiction is judged by how many of these indicators are present.\n\n(6). Pleasure in the brain is characterized by the release of dopamine into the accumbens. The hippocampus then stores this, the amygdala creates a conditioned response, and the prefrontal cortex organizes the information. The nucleus accumbens, also known as the reward center, are nerve cells located underneath the cerebral cortex; when food and water are consumed, for example, this reward system is activated, causing the release of dopamine. This pleasurable feeling ensures behaviors are repeated. The more rewarding an activity is, the more probable it is that one will remember and repeat it. How addictive a substance or activity will be is dependent on the speed, intensity, and reliability of the dopamine release. In drug use specifically, the route of entry plays a key role. For instance, consuming a drug intravenously rather than in pill form will yield a stronger and speedier dopamine signal, thus increasing the chance of addiction.\n\n(7). Like a bad habit, addiction can be difficult to quit. At the point that one decides to walk on a path of sobriety, cravings will be imminent. Merely thinking about engaging in an addictive activity can create a sensation of pleasure within an addict, making moving on much more challenging. Certain environmental cues in one’s surroundings can either initiate or exacerbate cravings, potentially triggering a relapse. Examples of environmental cues include a person, place, activity, or even a specific time. The brain forms a positive memory with drug use or an addictive activity and then incorporates the cues present into the narrative. As addictive behaviors increase in number, the association of cues to the addictive behavior is compounded. In addition to positive memories, negative memories can also lead to cravings. For example, feelings of withdrawal can cause emotional or physical distress; therefore, re-engaging in an addictive behavior would be due to withdrawal avoidance. A significant part of treatment is to ensure that cues do not trigger cravings or relapse.\n\n(8). Addiction causes changes in the brain by altering the prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is responsible for reasonable and logical decision-making in daily life. Damage to the prefrontal cortex because of addiction causes impulsivity and compulsivity - impulsivity is when one acts on a sudden desire or urge without thinking it through or considering the consequences, while compulsivity is behavior that is driven by the need to relieve anxiety. Therefore, once an addictive behavior is practiced, the distress and anxiety go away. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex plays a role in other processes; as such, damaging it affects memory, emotion, and stress regulation in the brain, as well as the brain’s reward system. Addiction also causes loss of rational thought, meaning that an afflicted individual will incorrectly weigh the pros and cons of their decisions. When one realizes that the costs of addictive behavior outweigh the benefits, they are more likely to reach sobriety.\n\n(9). Addiction does not have to be permanent, and recovery is very possible. Entirely ceasing to use or participate in addictive activities can potentially reverse many of the negative physical changes that have occurred in the brain. Furthermore, using combination therapies can aid with recovery from the physiological effects caused by addiction and diverting cravings by partaking in alternate activities can promote healing. The brain is highly adaptable, and every step made in the right direction can have a positive effect on it.\n\n(10). There are three principles that guide our understanding of addiction and treatment - these are learning, cognitive, and behavioral theory. Learning theory helps us comprehend how unhealthy behaviors are learned, and how they can be unlearned to promote recovery, whilst cognitive theory covers how one’s thoughts, emotions, and expectations lead to addiction; by modifying thoughts, one can be treated. Lastly, behavioral theory looks at addiction as a form of stunted development. Using psychotherapy to encourage growth and development is another way to generate a positive outcome.\n\n(11). For treatment to be successful, an individual must have humility and motivation, find meaning in their life, and be committed to the sustained effort of staying sober. Treatment for addiction can be undertaken by the individual, or it can extend to the care of professionals. Usually, addicts try to recover on their own, but when they feel they need help, they turn to treatment. Knowing when to ask for help and being able to do so is humility, while motivation is when one realizes that the cost of participating in addictive behavior is greater than the benefits. As not everyone has this amount of clarity, a significant part of treatment is being able to correctly assess a situation and consider the pros and cons. Sustained effort means to continue pursuing one’s goals of sobriety and maintain self-restraint, despite the discomfort of withdrawals. Lastly, one must find purpose in their life; when a person becomes an addict, participating in an addictive behavior becomes all-consuming. Thus, for treatment to be successful, individuals must find something meaningful that they are passionate about to replace their addictive behaviors. Examples include going to the gym, spending more time with family, or even volunteering. It is crucial for one to keep busy by doing the things they truly enjoy so that they do not fall back into their old ways."

      "text": "(1). Addiction occurs when one continually craves and engages in consuming a certain drug or activity, despite the detrimental consequences. It is a chronic disease that can change both brain structure and function, potentially involving substances such as alcohol, inhalants, opioids, cocaine, nicotine, or tobacco, or even behaviors such as excessive eating, shopping, exercising, technology use, and more. Although recovery from addiction is often a slow and complex process, it is very possible.\n\n(2). The initial consumption of an addictive substance or activity is usually voluntary; however, repeated offenses can lead to physiological changes, which can alter a person’s self-control and ability to resist a given substance. Hence, addiction can switch from a liking to an unwavering wanting. Globally, substance abuse accounts for 190,000 untimely deaths per year. Specifically, North America endures the greatest drug-related mortality rate (about one in four individuals worldwide, and one hundred individuals daily in the United States alone). Everyone can suffer from the harmful effects of addiction, including babies exposed to drugs prenatally, teenagers, adults, and even seniors.\n\n(3). Long-term effects of prolonged drug use can lead to other medical conditions, such as lung or cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, and mental disorders. Addiction to tobacco, for example, can cause cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx, blood, pancreas, kidney, bladder, and/or cervix. At times, mental illness and addiction occur in conjunction with each other; mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression or schizophrenia can be present before addiction, and other times can worsen or trigger a mental disorder. In fact, those who partake in substance abuse are three times more likely to have a mental illness.\n\n(4). Many factors can increase the likelihood of addiction. The more risk factors one has, the more he or she is inclined to fall prey to drug addiction. Biology, environment, and development are all crucial contributors to the disease. According to a twin and adoption study, 40% to 60% of susceptibility to addiction is genetic. Furthermore, varying brain characteristics between individuals can make one person more prone to the disease than another. Other biological factors that affect drug use and dependence include gender, ethnicity, and the presence of mental illness. In terms of environmental factors, these can include peer pressure, stress, substance abuse in family and friends, lack of parental guidance, easy access to substances, pop culture encouragement of drug use, and exposure to physical, sexual, or emotional abuse.

It is a chronic disease that can change both brain structure and function, potentially involving substances such as alcohol, inhalants, opioids, cocaine, nicotine, or tobacco, or even behaviors such as excessive eating, shopping, exercising, technology use, and more. Although recovery from addiction is often a slow and complex process, it is very possible.\n\n(2). The initial consumption of an addictive substance or activity is usually voluntary; however, repeated offenses can lead to physiological changes, which can alter a person’s self-control and ability to resist a given substance. Hence, addiction can switch from a liking to an unwavering wanting. Globally, substance abuse accounts for 190,000 untimely deaths per year. Specifically, North America endures the greatest drug-related mortality rate (about one in four individuals worldwide, and one hundred individuals daily in the United States alone). Everyone can suffer from the harmful effects of addiction, including babies exposed to drugs prenatally, teenagers, adults, and even seniors.\n\n(3). Long-term effects of prolonged drug use can lead to other medical conditions, such as lung or cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, and mental disorders. Addiction to tobacco, for example, can cause cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx, blood, pancreas, kidney, bladder, and/or cervix. At times, mental illness and addiction occur in conjunction with each other; mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression or schizophrenia can be present before addiction, and other times can worsen or trigger a mental disorder. In fact, those who partake in substance abuse are three times more likely to have a mental illness.\n\n(4). Many factors can increase the likelihood of addiction. The more risk factors one has, the more he or she is inclined to fall prey to drug addiction. Biology, environment, and development are all crucial contributors to the disease. According to a twin and adoption study, 40% to 60% of susceptibility to addiction is genetic. Furthermore, varying brain characteristics between individuals can make one person more prone to the disease than another. Other biological factors that affect drug use and dependence include gender, ethnicity, and the presence of mental illness. In terms of environmental factors, these can include peer pressure, stress, substance abuse in family and friends, lack of parental guidance, easy access to substances, pop culture encouragement of drug use, and exposure to physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. Lastly, development entails age - addiction can occur at any age, but the earlier an addictive habit begins, the higher the chance it will progress into a chronic disease.\n\n(5). A sign of addiction is using a substance or engaging in a specific activity for long periods, more than recommended. Other indicators include a lack of desire or effort to decrease use, intense cravings, and disturbances caused in one’s work, home, or social life. A further red flag is when an addictive behavior continues despite the physical and physiological harm it causes, on top of social and interpersonal consequences. Furthermore, when someone invests significant time either participating in, or recovering from, addictive behavior, it is a sign of addiction. The severity of the addiction is judged by how many of these indicators are present.\n\n(6). Pleasure in the brain is characterized by the release of dopamine into the accumbens. The hippocampus then stores this, the amygdala creates a conditioned response, and the prefrontal cortex organizes the information. The nucleus accumbens, also known as the reward center, are nerve cells located underneath the cerebral cortex; when food and water are consumed, for example, this reward system is activated, causing the release of dopamine. This pleasurable feeling ensures behaviors are repeated. The more rewarding an activity is, the more probable it is that one will remember and repeat it. How addictive a substance or activity will be is dependent on the speed, intensity, and reliability of the dopamine release. In drug use specifically, the route of entry plays a key role. For instance, consuming a drug intravenously rather than in pill form will yield a stronger and speedier dopamine signal, thus increasing the chance of addiction.\n\n(7). Like a bad habit, addiction can be difficult to quit. At the point that one decides to walk on a path of sobriety, cravings will be imminent. Merely thinking about engaging in an addictive activity can create a sensation of pleasure within an addict, making moving on much more challenging. Certain environmental cues in one’s surroundings can either initiate or exacerbate cravings, potentially triggering a relapse. Examples of environmental cues include a person, place, activity, or even a specific time. The brain forms a positive memory with drug use or an addictive activity and then incorporates the cues present into the narrative. As addictive behaviors increase in number, the association of cues to the addictive behavior is compounded. In addition to positive memories, negative memories can also lead to cravings. For example, feelings of withdrawal can cause emotional or physical distress; therefore, re-engaging in an addictive behavior would be due to withdrawal avoidance. A significant part of treatment is to ensure that cues do not trigger cravings or relapse.\n\n(8). Addiction causes changes in the brain by altering the prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is responsible for reasonable and logical decision-making in daily life. Damage to the prefrontal cortex because of addiction causes impulsivity and compulsivity - impulsivity is when one acts on a sudden desire or urge without thinking it through or considering the consequences, while compulsivity is behavior that is driven by the need to relieve anxiety. Therefore, once an addictive behavior is practiced, the distress and anxiety go away. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex plays a role in other processes; as such, damaging it affects memory, emotion, and stress regulation in the brain, as well as the brain’s reward system. Addiction also causes loss of rational thought, meaning that an afflicted individual will incorrectly weigh the pros and cons of their decisions. When one realizes that the costs of addictive behavior outweigh the benefits, they are more likely to reach sobriety.\n\n(9). Addiction does not have to be permanent, and recovery is very possible. Entirely ceasing to use or participate in addictive activities can potentially reverse many of the negative physical changes that have occurred in the brain. Furthermore, using combination therapies can aid with recovery from the physiological effects caused by addiction and diverting cravings by partaking in alternate activities can promote healing. The brain is highly adaptable, and every step made in the right direction can have a positive effect on it.\n\n(10). There are three principles that guide our understanding of addiction and treatment - these are learning, cognitive, and behavioral theory. Learning theory helps us comprehend how unhealthy behaviors are learned, and how they can be unlearned to promote recovery, whilst cognitive theory covers how one’s thoughts, emotions, and expectations lead to addiction; by modifying thoughts, one can be treated. Lastly, behavioral theory looks at addiction as a form of stunted development. Using psychotherapy to encourage growth and development is another way to generate a positive outcome.\n\n(11). For treatment to be successful, an individual must have humility and motivation, find meaning in their life, and be committed to the sustained effort of staying sober. Treatment for addiction can be undertaken by the individual, or it can extend to the care of professionals. Usually, addicts try to recover on their own, but when they feel they need help, they turn to treatment. Knowing when to ask for help and being able to do so is humility, while motivation is when one realizes that the cost of participating in addictive behavior is greater than the benefits. As not everyone has this amount of clarity, a significant part of treatment is being able to correctly assess a situation and consider the pros and cons. Sustained effort means to continue pursuing one’s goals of sobriety and maintain self-restraint, despite the discomfort of withdrawals. Lastly, one must find purpose in their life; when a person becomes an addict, participating in an addictive behavior becomes all-consuming. Thus, for treatment to be successful, individuals must find something meaningful that they are passionate about to replace their addictive behaviors. Examples include going to the gym, spending more time with family, or even volunteering. It is crucial for one to keep busy by doing the things they truly enjoy so that they do not fall back into their old ways."

Those who are addicted to tobacco are prone to developing mouth, throat, larynx, and blood cancers – is incorrect because while paragraph 3 does discuss tobacco addiction, the author also provides a broad overview of illnesses that go hand in hand with addiction, not just this one. Option D.

      "title": "Passage 2",
      "text": "(1). Addiction occurs when one continually craves and engages in consuming a certain drug or activity, despite the detrimental consequences. It is a chronic disease that can change both brain structure and function, potentially involving substances such as alcohol, inhalants, opioids, cocaine, nicotine, or tobacco, or even behaviors such as excessive eating, shopping, exercising, technology use, and more. Although recovery from addiction is often a slow and complex process, it is very possible.\n\n(2). The initial consumption of an addictive substance or activity is usually voluntary; however, repeated offenses can lead to physiological changes, which can alter a person’s self-control and ability to resist a given substance. Hence, addiction can switch from a liking to an unwavering wanting. Globally, substance abuse accounts for 190,000 untimely deaths per year. Specifically, North America endures the greatest drug-related mortality rate (about one in four individuals worldwide, and one hundred individuals daily in the United States alone). Everyone can suffer from the harmful effects of addiction, including babies exposed to drugs prenatally, teenagers, adults, and even seniors.\n\n(3). Long-term effects of prolonged drug use can lead to other medical conditions, such as lung or cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, and mental disorders. Addiction to tobacco, for example, can cause cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx, blood, pancreas, kidney, bladder, and/or cervix. At times, mental illness and addiction occur in conjunction with each other; mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression or schizophrenia can be present before addiction, and other times can worsen or trigger a mental disorder. In fact, those who partake in substance abuse are three times more likely to have a mental illness.\n\n(4). Many factors can increase the likelihood of addiction. The more risk factors one has, the more he or she is inclined to fall prey to drug addiction. Biology, environment, and development are all crucial contributors to the disease. According to a twin and adoption study, 40% to 60% of susceptibility to addiction is genetic. Furthermore, varying brain characteristics between individuals can make one person more prone to the disease than another. Other biological factors that affect drug use and dependence include gender, ethnicity, and the presence of mental illness. In terms of environmental factors, these can include peer pressure, stress, substance abuse in family and friends, lack of parental guidance, easy access to substances, pop culture encouragement of drug use, and exposure to physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. Lastly, development entails age - addiction can occur at any age, but the earlier an addictive habit begins, the higher the chance it will progress into a chronic disease.\n\n(5). A sign of addiction is using a substance or engaging in a specific activity for long periods, more than recommended. Other indicators include a lack of desire or effort to decrease use, intense cravings, and disturbances caused in one’s work, home, or social life. A further red flag is when an addictive behavior continues despite the physical and physiological harm it causes, on top of social and interpersonal consequences. Furthermore, when someone invests significant time either participating in, or recovering from, addictive behavior, it is a sign of addiction. The severity of the addiction is judged by how many of these indicators are present.\n\n(6). Pleasure in the brain is characterized by the release of dopamine into the accumbens. The hippocampus then stores this, the amygdala creates a conditioned response, and the prefrontal cortex organizes the information. The nucleus accumbens, also known as the reward center, are nerve cells located underneath the cerebral cortex; when food and water are consumed, for example, this reward system is activated, causing the release of dopamine. This pleasurable feeling ensures behaviors are repeated. The more rewarding an activity is, the more probable it is that one will remember and repeat it. How addictive a substance or activity will be is dependent on the speed, intensity, and reliability of the dopamine release. In drug use specifically, the route of entry plays a key role. For instance, consuming a drug intravenously rather than in pill form will yield a stronger and speedier dopamine signal, thus increasing the chance of addiction.\n\n(7). Like a bad habit, addiction can be difficult to quit. At the point that one decides to walk on a path of sobriety, cravings will be imminent. Merely thinking about engaging in an addictive activity can create a sensation of pleasure within an addict, making moving on much more challenging. Certain environmental cues in one’s surroundings can either initiate or exacerbate cravings, potentially triggering a relapse. Examples of environmental cues include a person, place, activity, or even a specific time. The brain forms a positive memory with drug use or an addictive activity and then incorporates the cues present into the narrative. As addictive behaviors increase in number, the association of cues to the addictive behavior is compounded. In addition to positive memories, negative memories can also lead to cravings. For example, feelings of withdrawal can cause emotional or physical distress; therefore, re-engaging in an addictive behavior would be due to withdrawal avoidance. A significant part of treatment is to ensure that cues do not trigger cravings or relapse.\n\n(8). Addiction causes changes in the brain by altering the prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is responsible for reasonable and logical decision-making in daily life. Damage to the prefrontal cortex because of addiction causes impulsivity and compulsivity - impulsivity is when one acts on a sudden desire or urge without thinking it through or considering the consequences, while compulsivity is behavior that is driven by the need to relieve anxiety. Therefore, once an addictive behavior is practiced, the distress and anxiety go away. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex plays a role in other processes; as such, damaging it affects memory, emotion, and stress regulation in the brain, as well as the brain’s reward system. Addiction also causes loss of rational thought, meaning that an afflicted individual will incorrectly weigh the pros and cons of their decisions. When one realizes that the costs of addictive behavior outweigh the benefits, they are more likely to reach sobriety.\n\n(9). Addiction does not have to be permanent, and recovery is very possible. Entirely ceasing to use or participate in addictive activities can potentially reverse many of the negative physical changes that have occurred in the brain. Furthermore, using combination therapies can aid with recovery from the physiological effects caused by addiction and diverting cravings by partaking in alternate activities can promote healing. The brain is highly adaptable, and every step made in the right direction can have a positive effect on it.\n\n(10). There are three principles that guide our understanding of addiction and treatment - these are learning, cognitive, and behavioral theory. Learning theory helps us comprehend how unhealthy behaviors are learned, and how they can be unlearned to promote recovery, whilst cognitive theory covers how one’s thoughts, emotions, and expectations lead to addiction; by modifying thoughts, one can be treated. Lastly, behavioral theory looks at addiction as a form of stunted development. Using psychotherapy to encourage growth and development is another way to generate a positive outcome.\n\n(11). For treatment to be successful, an individual must have humility and motivation, find meaning in their life, and be committed to the sustained effort of staying sober. Treatment for addiction can be undertaken by the individual, or it can extend to the care of professionals. Usually, addicts try to recover on their own, but when they feel they need help, they turn to treatment. Knowing when to ask for help and being able to do so is humility, while motivation is when one realizes that the cost of participating in addictive behavior is greater than the benefits. As not everyone has this amount of clarity, a significant part of treatment is being able to correctly assess a situation and consider the pros and cons. Sustained effort means to continue pursuing one’s goals of sobriety and maintain self-restraint, despite the discomfort of withdrawals. Lastly, one must find purpose in their life; when a person becomes an addict, participating in an addictive behavior becomes all-consuming. Thus, for treatment to be successful, individuals must find something meaningful that they are passionate about to replace their addictive behaviors. Examples include going to the gym, spending more time with family, or even volunteering. It is crucial for one to keep busy by doing the things they truly enjoy so that they do not fall back into their old ways."

Addiction is difficult or even impossible to overcome for some – is incorrect because, while the author does mention that addiction is difficult to defeat, they liken it to a bad habit that is not impossible to overcome. Additionally, this is not the best reflection of the paragraph, as it is more focused on cues. Option C. Addictive activities create a sense of pleasure in an addict – is incorrect because, while this is briefly mentioned in the paragraph, this isn’t the focus. The paragraph is more focused on cues, which can cause feelings of withdrawal. Option D. The presentation of cues does not cause feelings of withdrawal but may lead to relapse – is incorrect because this is a false statement.

      "text": "(1). Addiction occurs when one continually craves and engages in consuming a certain drug or activity, despite the detrimental consequences. It is a chronic disease that can change both brain structure and function, potentially involving substances such as alcohol, inhalants, opioids, cocaine, nicotine, or tobacco, or even behaviors such as excessive eating, shopping, exercising, technology use, and more. Although recovery from addiction is often a slow and complex process, it is very possible.\n\n(2). The initial consumption of an addictive substance or activity is usually voluntary; however, repeated offenses can lead to physiological changes, which can alter a person’s self-control and ability to resist a given substance. Hence, addiction can switch from a liking to an unwavering wanting. Globally, substance abuse accounts for 190,000 untimely deaths per year. Specifically, North America endures the greatest drug-related mortality rate (about one in four individuals worldwide, and one hundred individuals daily in the United States alone). Everyone can suffer from the harmful effects of addiction, including babies exposed to drugs prenatally, teenagers, adults, and even seniors.\n\n(3). Long-term effects of prolonged drug use can lead to other medical conditions, such as lung or cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, and mental disorders. Addiction to tobacco, for example, can cause cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx, blood, pancreas, kidney, bladder, and/or cervix. At times, mental illness and addiction occur in conjunction with each other; mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression or schizophrenia can be present before addiction, and other times can worsen or trigger a mental disorder. In fact, those who partake in substance abuse are three times more likely to have a mental illness.\n\n(4). Many factors can increase the likelihood of addiction. The more risk factors one has, the more he or she is inclined to fall prey to drug addiction. Biology, environment, and development are all crucial contributors to the disease. According to a twin and adoption study, 40% to 60% of susceptibility to addiction is genetic. Furthermore, varying brain characteristics between individuals can make one person more prone to the disease than another. Other biological factors that affect drug use and dependence include gender, ethnicity, and the presence of mental illness. In terms of environmental factors, these can include peer pressure, stress, substance abuse in family and friends, lack of parental guidance, easy access to substances, pop culture encouragement of drug use, and exposure to physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. Lastly, development entails age - addiction can occur at any age, but the earlier an addictive habit begins, the higher the chance it will progress into a chronic disease.\n\n(5). A sign of addiction is using a substance or engaging in a specific activity for long periods, more than recommended. Other indicators include a lack of desire or effort to decrease use, intense cravings, and disturbances caused in one’s work, home, or social life. A further red flag is when an addictive behavior continues despite the physical and physiological harm it causes, on top of social and interpersonal consequences. Furthermore, when someone invests significant time either participating in, or recovering from, addictive behavior, it is a sign of addiction. The severity of the addiction is judged by how many of these indicators are present.\n\n(6). Pleasure in the brain is characterized by the release of dopamine into the accumbens. The hippocampus then stores this, the amygdala creates a conditioned response, and the prefrontal cortex organizes the information. The nucleus accumbens, also known as the reward center, are nerve cells located underneath the cerebral cortex; when food and water are consumed, for example, this reward system is activated, causing the release of dopamine. This pleasurable feeling ensures behaviors are repeated. The more rewarding an activity is, the more probable it is that one will remember and repeat it. How addictive a substance or activity will be is dependent on the speed, intensity, and reliability of the dopamine release. In drug use specifically, the route of entry plays a key role. For instance, consuming a drug intravenously rather than in pill form will yield a stronger and speedier dopamine signal, thus increasing the chance of addiction.\n\n(7). Like a bad habit, addiction can be difficult to quit. At the point that one decides to walk on a path of sobriety, cravings will be imminent. Merely thinking about engaging in an addictive activity can create a sensation of pleasure within an addict, making moving on much more challenging. Certain environmental cues in one’s surroundings can either initiate or exacerbate cravings, potentially triggering a relapse. Examples of environmental cues include a person, place, activity, or even a specific time. The brain forms a positive memory with drug use or an addictive activity and then incorporates the cues present into the narrative. As addictive behaviors increase in number, the association of cues to the addictive behavior is compounded. In addition to positive memories, negative memories can also lead to cravings. For example, feelings of withdrawal can cause emotional or physical distress; therefore, re-engaging in an addictive behavior would be due to withdrawal avoidance. A significant part of treatment is to ensure that cues do not trigger cravings or relapse.\n\n(8). Addiction causes changes in the brain by altering the prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is responsible for reasonable and logical decision-making in daily life. Damage to the prefrontal cortex because of addiction causes impulsivity and compulsivity - impulsivity is when one acts on a sudden desire or urge without thinking it through or considering the consequences, while compulsivity is behavior that is driven by the need to relieve anxiety. Therefore, once an addictive behavior is practiced, the distress and anxiety go away. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex plays a role in other processes; as such, damaging it affects memory, emotion, and stress regulation in the brain, as well as the brain’s reward system. Addiction also causes loss of rational thought, meaning that an afflicted individual will incorrectly weigh the pros and cons of their decisions. When one realizes that the costs of addictive behavior outweigh the benefits, they are more likely to reach sobriety.\n\n(9). Addiction does not have to be permanent, and recovery is very possible. Entirely ceasing to use or participate in addictive activities can potentially reverse many of the negative physical changes that have occurred in the brain. Furthermore, using combination therapies can aid with recovery from the physiological effects caused by addiction and diverting cravings by partaking in alternate activities can promote healing. The brain is highly adaptable, and every step made in the right direction can have a positive effect on it.\n\n(10). There are three principles that guide our understanding of addiction and treatment - these are learning, cognitive, and behavioral theory. Learning theory helps us comprehend how unhealthy behaviors are learned, and how they can be unlearned to promote recovery, whilst cognitive theory covers how one’s thoughts, emotions, and expectations lead to addiction; by modifying thoughts, one can be treated. Lastly, behavioral theory looks at addiction as a form of stunted development. Using psychotherapy to encourage growth and development is another way to generate a positive outcome.\n\n(11). For treatment to be successful, an individual must have humility and motivation, find meaning in their life, and be committed to the sustained effort of staying sober. Treatment for addiction can be undertaken by the individual, or it can extend to the care of professionals. Usually, addicts try to recover on their own, but when they feel they need help, they turn to treatment. Knowing when to ask for help and being able to do so is humility, while motivation is when one realizes that the cost of participating in addictive behavior is greater than the benefits. As not everyone has this amount of clarity, a significant part of treatment is being able to correctly assess a situation and consider the pros and cons. Sustained effort means to continue pursuing one’s goals of sobriety and maintain self-restraint, despite the discomfort of withdrawals. Lastly, one must find purpose in their life; when a person becomes an addict, participating in an addictive behavior becomes all-consuming. Thus, for treatment to be successful, individuals must find something meaningful that they are passionate about to replace their addictive behaviors. Examples include going to the gym, spending more time with family, or even volunteering. It is crucial for one to keep busy by doing the things they truly enjoy so that they do not fall back into their old ways."

For example, feelings of withdrawal can cause emotional or physical distress; therefore, re-engaging in an addictive behavior would be due to withdrawal avoidance. A significant part of treatment is to ensure that cues do not trigger cravings or relapse.\n\n(8). Addiction causes changes in the brain by altering the prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is responsible for reasonable and logical decision-making in daily life. Damage to the prefrontal cortex because of addiction causes impulsivity and compulsivity - impulsivity is when one acts on a sudden desire or urge without thinking it through or considering the consequences, while compulsivity is behavior that is driven by the need to relieve anxiety. Therefore, once an addictive behavior is practiced, the distress and anxiety go away. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex plays a role in other processes; as such, damaging it affects memory, emotion, and stress regulation in the brain, as well as the brain’s reward system. Addiction also causes loss of rational thought, meaning that an afflicted individual will incorrectly weigh the pros and cons of their decisions. When one realizes that the costs of addictive behavior outweigh the benefits, they are more likely to reach sobriety.\n\n(9). Addiction does not have to be permanent, and recovery is very possible. Entirely ceasing to use or participate in addictive activities can potentially reverse many of the negative physical changes that have occurred in the brain. Furthermore, using combination therapies can aid with recovery from the physiological effects caused by addiction and diverting cravings by partaking in alternate activities can promote healing. The brain is highly adaptable, and every step made in the right direction can have a positive effect on it.\n\n(10). There are three principles that guide our understanding of addiction and treatment - these are learning, cognitive, and behavioral theory. Learning theory helps us comprehend how unhealthy behaviors are learned, and how they can be unlearned to promote recovery, whilst cognitive theory covers how one’s thoughts, emotions, and expectations lead to addiction; by modifying thoughts, one can be treated. Lastly, behavioral theory looks at addiction as a form of stunted development. Using psychotherapy to encourage growth and development is another way to generate a positive outcome.\n\n(11). For treatment to be successful, an individual must have humility and motivation, find meaning in their life, and be committed to the sustained effort of staying sober. Treatment for addiction can be undertaken by the individual, or it can extend to the care of professionals. Usually, addicts try to recover on their own, but when they feel they need help, they turn to treatment. Knowing when to ask for help and being able to do so is humility, while motivation is when one realizes that the cost of participating in addictive behavior is greater than the benefits. As not everyone has this amount of clarity, a significant part of treatment is being able to correctly assess a situation and consider the pros and cons. Sustained effort means to continue pursuing one’s goals of sobriety and maintain self-restraint, despite the discomfort of withdrawals. Lastly, one must find purpose in their life; when a person becomes an addict, participating in an addictive behavior becomes all-consuming. Thus, for treatment to be successful, individuals must find something meaningful that they are passionate about to replace their addictive behaviors. Examples include going to the gym, spending more time with family, or even volunteering. It is crucial for one to keep busy by doing the things they truly enjoy so that they do not fall back into their old ways."

      "text": "(1). Addiction occurs when one continually craves and engages in consuming a certain drug or activity, despite the detrimental consequences. It is a chronic disease that can change both brain structure and function, potentially involving substances such as alcohol, inhalants, opioids, cocaine, nicotine, or tobacco, or even behaviors such as excessive eating, shopping, exercising, technology use, and more. Although recovery from addiction is often a slow and complex process, it is very possible.\n\n(2). The initial consumption of an addictive substance or activity is usually voluntary; however, repeated offenses can lead to physiological changes, which can alter a person’s self-control and ability to resist a given substance. Hence, addiction can switch from a liking to an unwavering wanting. Globally, substance abuse accounts for 190,000 untimely deaths per year. Specifically, North America endures the greatest drug-related mortality rate (about one in four individuals worldwide, and one hundred individuals daily in the United States alone). Everyone can suffer from the harmful effects of addiction, including babies exposed to drugs prenatally, teenagers, adults, and even seniors.\n\n(3). Long-term effects of prolonged drug use can lead to other medical conditions, such as lung or cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, and mental disorders. Addiction to tobacco, for example, can cause cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx, blood, pancreas, kidney, bladder, and/or cervix. At times, mental illness and addiction occur in conjunction with each other; mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression or schizophrenia can be present before addiction, and other times can worsen or trigger a mental disorder. In fact, those who partake in substance abuse are three times more likely to have a mental illness.\n\n(4). Many factors can increase the likelihood of addiction. The more risk factors one has, the more he or she is inclined to fall prey to drug addiction. Biology, environment, and development are all crucial contributors to the disease. According to a twin and adoption study, 40% to 60% of susceptibility to addiction is genetic. Furthermore, varying brain characteristics between individuals can make one person more prone to the disease than another. Other biological factors that affect drug use and dependence include gender, ethnicity, and the presence of mental illness. In terms of environmental factors, these can include peer pressure, stress, substance abuse in family and friends, lack of parental guidance, easy access to substances, pop culture encouragement of drug use, and exposure to physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. Lastly, development entails age - addiction can occur at any age, but the earlier an addictive habit begins, the higher the chance it will progress into a chronic disease.\n\n(5). A sign of addiction is using a substance or engaging in a specific activity for long periods, more than recommended. Other indicators include a lack of desire or effort to decrease use, intense cravings, and disturbances caused in one’s work, home, or social life. A further red flag is when an addictive behavior continues despite the physical and physiological harm it causes, on top of social and interpersonal consequences. Furthermore, when someone invests significant time either participating in, or recovering from, addictive behavior, it is a sign of addiction. The severity of the addiction is judged by how many of these indicators are present.\n\n(6). Pleasure in the brain is characterized by the release of dopamine into the accumbens. The hippocampus then stores this, the amygdala creates a conditioned response, and the prefrontal cortex organizes the information. The nucleus accumbens, also known as the reward center, are nerve cells located underneath the cerebral cortex; when food and water are consumed, for example, this reward system is activated, causing the release of dopamine. This pleasurable feeling ensures behaviors are repeated. The more rewarding an activity is, the more probable it is that one will remember and repeat it. How addictive a substance or activity will be is dependent on the speed, intensity, and reliability of the dopamine release. In drug use specifically, the route of entry plays a key role. For instance, consuming a drug intravenously rather than in pill form will yield a stronger and speedier dopamine signal, thus increasing the chance of addiction.\n\n(7). Like a bad habit, addiction can be difficult to quit. At the point that one decides to walk on a path of sobriety, cravings will be imminent. Merely thinking about engaging in an addictive activity can create a sensation of pleasure within an addict, making moving on much more challenging. Certain environmental cues in one’s surroundings can either initiate or exacerbate cravings, potentially triggering a relapse. Examples of environmental cues include a person, place, activity, or even a specific time. The brain forms a positive memory with drug use or an addictive activity and then incorporates the cues present into the narrative. As addictive behaviors increase in number, the association of cues to the addictive behavior is compounded. In addition to positive memories, negative memories can also lead to cravings. For example, feelings of withdrawal can cause emotional or physical distress; therefore, re-engaging in an addictive behavior would be due to withdrawal avoidance.

The first choice mentions behavioral therapy, which is discussed in paragraph 10. This tells us that behavioural therapy focuses on something OTHER than analyzing the emotions of a person. Thus, the author would disagree with the first option choice. It reads: “Lastly, behavioral theory looks at addiction as a form of stunted development.” The second option choice mentions smoking, which is referenced in paragraph 6. Based on this statement, the author says taking drugs intravenously, NOT through smoking, is more potent than pills. Thus, the author would disagree with the second option choice. It reads: “For instance, consuming a drug intravenously rather than in pill form will yield a stronger and speedier dopamine signal, thus increasing the chance of addiction.” The third option choice covers serotonin, which is not mentioned in the passage. Instead, dopamine is cited in paragraph 6. Thus, the author would disagree with the third option choice. It reads: “Pleasure in the brain is characterized by the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine into the nucleus accumbens.” The fourth answer choice mentions the forming of associations, which is covered in paragraph 7. This paragraph references a person (which would include the friend in the stem) as an external cue that can be compounded through repetitive exposure. It reads: “Certain environmental cues in one’s surroundings can either initiate or exacerbate cravings, potentially triggering a relapse. Examples of environmental cues include a person, place, activity, or even a specific time. The brain forms a positive memory with drug use or an addictive activity and then incorporates the cues present into the narrative. As addictive behaviors increase in number, the association of cues to the addictive behavior is compounded. In addition to positive memories, negative memories can also lead to cravings.” The fifth option choice mentions external cues. In paragraph 7, the author mentions the statement below. This does not mention external cues; thus, the author would disagree with the fifth option choice. It reads: “A significant part of treatment is to ensure that cues do not trigger cravings or relapse.” Consequently, the dependent person has a harder time defeating his addiction because the associations are so strong.

      "text": "(1). Dentistry has kept pace with recent technological innovations, particularly within the field of digital dentistry. With advances in imaging, manufacturing, and software integration, dentists are able to use computer-based tools to diagnose, carry-out dental procedures, and conduct follow-up assessments with higher efficiency and accuracy. As such, digital dentistry is replacing or supplementing traditional methods within this field.\n\n(2). A significant contribution to digital dentistry has been computer-aided design and manufacturing, known as CAD/CAM. Using CAD software, dentists convert non-digital data of their patient’s oral cavity into a digital format, apply necessary edits, and create the required physical materials using 3D printing or milling. The latter process of milling involves using a small cutting machine that automatically processes the material into the required dental device. 3D printing, on the other hand, involves creating a three-dimensional object from its digital model by systematically depositing layer upon layer of material. One of the earliest applications of 3D printing within dentistry involved creating study models which provided information on a patient’s dentition and occlusion. Even now, these models serve as invaluable visual aids for both dentists and patients. For the former, these replicas allow for the assessment of abnormalities and visualization of complex or unusual anatomical features. They are hence, used by dentists to conduct procedures with more accuracy and confidence. These models have also been useful in patient communication as they allow patients to visualize their treatment plans.\n\n(3). Amongst its many other applications, 3D printing technology is often used in indirect restorative procedures to perform complex restorations efficiently. When receiving such treatment, the dentist first prepares the site of restoration by removing decayed or damaged parts of the tooth in a process known as tooth preparation. Then, the dentist performs an intraoral scan using an optical scanner to digitally capture the tooth preparation and the surrounding teeth as a 3D image. Afterwards, the dentist uses CAD/CAM software to analyze the image and create the restorative design. Depending on the design, the dental practitioner may 3D print or use a milling machine to construct the restoration. If the dentist decides to use 3D printing, they will utilize different types of resins depending on the purpose and functionality of the dental device. On the other hand, if a milling machine is selected, it will utilize the restorative design to shape a block of ceramic into the desired crown, inlay, onlay, veneer, or bridge. After polishing the object to give it a more natural look, it is placed in the patient's mouth to complete the restorative procedure. Polishing is important as it minimizes the chances of plaque accumulation and protects the object from fracturing.\n\n(4). Notably, dental practices that own scanners, milling machines, and 3D printers can begin restorative treatments almost immediately. Compact millers which have recently entered the market allow dentists to scan, mill, and deliver restorations all within a single appointment. Furthermore, through these technologies, dentists can obtain a digital representation of the intraoral soft and hard tissues which allows patients to avoid the discomfort associated with traditional impressions. Thus, one of the greatest benefits of digital dentistry is the fact that this advancement has improved efficiency and accuracy while maintaining patient satisfaction and comfort.\n\n(5). It is important to note the wide scope of dentistry. This field has several specialties including orthodontics, periodontics, endodontics, prosthodontics, and oral and maxillofacial surgery, among others. Each specialty focuses on a specific area of dental care and requires specialized training and expertise. Since orthodontists focus on correcting mal-positioned teeth and misaligned bite patterns, aligners and retainers are commonly used in orthodontic treatments. By utilizing digital dentistry tools such CAD/CAM technology, orthodontists can create these dental devices with high precision and customization. Likewise, dentists specializing in prosthodontics can utilize these tools to create dental prostheses such as crowns, bridges, and dentures in a short amount of time. This has significantly reduced the need for multiple appointments and temporary restorations.\n\n(6). Oral and maxillofacial surgery, on the other hand, is a specialized field of dentistry that encompasses reconstructive surgery of the face, oral cavity, facial trauma surgery, and head, neck, mouth, and jaw anomalies. Additionally, oral and maxillofacial surgeons may also perform facial plastic and cosmetic procedures including cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries. Surgeons have used tools such as 3D printing to create surgical guides for dental implant placements. They have also been used to create models of the jaw and other structures when planning complex procedures. Furthermore, Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)- a radiographic imaging device, is often used by oral and maxillofacial surgeons to produce holistic 3D images of the facial bones and tissues. Supplementing this with other digital dentistry tools has allowed for accurate surgical planning and ease in post-treatment assessments. A more comprehensive list of the various dental specialties can be found in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: Dental Specialties\n\nDental Specialty\n\nDescription\n\nOrthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics\n\nProsthodontics\n\nPeriodontics\n\nEndodontics\n\nPediatric Dentistry\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Surgery\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Pathology\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Radiology\n\nDental Public Health\n\n(7). Technological innovations have permeated all fields of dentistry. Within dental public health and general dentistry, teledentistry has allowed practitioners to remotely diagnose and treat patients while promoting oral health awareness. These applications have been particularly useful in areas where large geographical distances limit access to oral health services for many people. Other technology such as the VELscope- a special light that is shone into the mouth of patients, has proven to help oral pathologists detect oral cancer and other abnormalities. Additionally, laser technology allows periodontists to remove infected tissue and stimulate healing without the need for invasive surgical procedures. Hence, regardless of the field of practice, dentists use technological advancements and the tools at their disposal to provide precise and customized services to their patients.\n\n(8). Nonetheless, there are limitations to these technologies. For starters, extensive post-processing is involved when dental devices are constructed using CAD/CAM technology. For example, the dental professional must remove the support structures often used by 3D printers when creating these devices. Other types of processing include cleaning the object of any debris, utilizing abrasive tools to smooth and polish the object, and finalizing the object by bonding different components together or applying protective coatings. Furthermore, 3D-printed objects can also be subjected to the “staircase effect” whereby the layer marks are distinctly visible as ridges. This can cause the object to obtain slight dimensional inaccuracies. In some cases, an object with these ridges may also have lower structural integrity and may become more susceptible to fractures. Additionally, despite significant progress in imaging technology, dental diagnostic tools such as the CBCT still lack the ability to capture a detailed depiction of certain soft tissue conditions. Thus, specific pathologies- including some head and neck infections, go undiagnosed. (9). Despite these limitations, research within artificial intelligence (AI) alludes to a promising future for digital dentistry and for dentistry as a whole. In fact, recent advances in AI algorithms have resulted in improved 3D-printed models for diagnosis and treatment planning. Furthermore, such algorithms have been invaluable in assessing and predicting trends within dentistry which include caries risk assessments, orthodontic treatment outcomes, and oral disease progression. Such data can be used to advocate for necessary oral health policies. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated algorithms to improve the overall predictive power and accuracy of existing diagnostic tools. Additionally, integrating innovations such as virtual reality into dentistry and dental education can prove to be invaluable as it can improve treatment planning and assessment through realistic simulators. Evidently, the potential to advance dentistry through technology is limitless."

It allows for the production of custom dentures – is incorrect because in paragraph 5 the author writes, “…dentists specializing in prosthodontics can utilize these tools to create dental prostheses such as crowns, bridges, and dentures in a short amount of time.” Dentures are described as dental prostheses used in prosthodontic procedures. This option describes how digital dentistry is useful for prosthodontists, NOT orthodontists, because there is no evidence in the passage to indicate that orthodontics use CAD/CAM technology to create dentures. On the other hand, the passage does state that “…aligners and retainers are commonly used in orthodontic treatments.

      "text": "(1). Dentistry has kept pace with recent technological innovations, particularly within the field of digital dentistry. With advances in imaging, manufacturing, and software integration, dentists are able to use computer-based tools to diagnose, carry-out dental procedures, and conduct follow-up assessments with higher efficiency and accuracy. As such, digital dentistry is replacing or supplementing traditional methods within this field.\n\n(2). A significant contribution to digital dentistry has been computer-aided design and manufacturing, known as CAD/CAM. Using CAD software, dentists convert non-digital data of their patient’s oral cavity into a digital format, apply necessary edits, and create the required physical materials using 3D printing or milling. The latter process of milling involves using a small cutting machine that automatically processes the material into the required dental device. 3D printing, on the other hand, involves creating a three-dimensional object from its digital model by systematically depositing layer upon layer of material. One of the earliest applications of 3D printing within dentistry involved creating study models which provided information on a patient’s dentition and occlusion. Even now, these models serve as invaluable visual aids for both dentists and patients. For the former, these replicas allow for the assessment of abnormalities and visualization of complex or unusual anatomical features. They are hence, used by dentists to conduct procedures with more accuracy and confidence.

Additionally, Table 1 states that orthodontics “Focuses on correcting the growth and development of dentofacial structures and treating abnormalities associated with these structures.” The scenario presented in the question does not suggest that there is an abnormal growth of dentofacial structures.

Hence, it is unclear how an orthodontist would be involved in the patient’s care. Similarly, Table 1 outlines the focus of a periodontist as “Concerned with treating diseases and conditions that affect the supporting and surrounding tissues of the teeth.” There is no mention of the teeth’s supporting tissues in the question and so, it is unclear how a periodontist would be involved in the patient’s care. If one is still tempted to choose a periodontist based on the assumption that “surgical resection and subsequent reconstruction” involves the supporting structures of the teeth, the first part of this answer involving orthodontics is still incorrect, making the entire option incorrect. Option C .

      "text": "(1). Dentistry has kept pace with recent technological innovations, particularly within the field of digital dentistry. With advances in imaging, manufacturing, and software integration, dentists are able to use computer-based tools to diagnose, carry-out dental procedures, and conduct follow-up assessments with higher efficiency and accuracy. As such, digital dentistry is replacing or supplementing traditional methods within this field.\n\n(2). A significant contribution to digital dentistry has been computer-aided design and manufacturing, known as CAD/CAM. Using CAD software, dentists convert non-digital data of their patient’s oral cavity into a digital format, apply necessary edits, and create the required physical materials using 3D printing or milling. The latter process of milling involves using a small cutting machine that automatically processes the material into the required dental device. 3D printing, on the other hand, involves creating a three-dimensional object from its digital model by systematically depositing layer upon layer of material. One of the earliest applications of 3D printing within dentistry involved creating study models which provided information on a patient’s dentition and occlusion. Even now, these models serve as invaluable visual aids for both dentists and patients. For the former, these replicas allow for the assessment of abnormalities and visualization of complex or unusual anatomical features. They are hence, used by dentists to conduct procedures with more accuracy and confidence. These models have also been useful in patient communication as they allow patients to visualize their treatment plans.\n\n(3). Amongst its many other applications, 3D printing technology is often used in indirect restorative procedures to perform complex restorations efficiently. When receiving such treatment, the dentist first prepares the site of restoration by removing decayed or damaged parts of the tooth in a process known as tooth preparation. Then, the dentist performs an intraoral scan using an optical scanner to digitally capture the tooth preparation and the surrounding teeth as a 3D image. Afterwards, the dentist uses CAD/CAM software to analyze the image and create the restorative design. Depending on the design, the dental practitioner may 3D print or use a milling machine to construct the restoration. If the dentist decides to use 3D printing, they will utilize different types of resins depending on the purpose and functionality of the dental device. On the other hand, if a milling machine is selected, it will utilize the restorative design to shape a block of ceramic into the desired crown, inlay, onlay, veneer, or bridge. After polishing the object to give it a more natural look, it is placed in the patient's mouth to complete the restorative procedure. Polishing is important as it minimizes the chances of plaque accumulation and protects the object from fracturing.\n\n(4). Notably, dental practices that own scanners, milling machines, and 3D printers can begin restorative treatments almost immediately. Compact millers which have recently entered the market allow dentists to scan, mill, and deliver restorations all within a single appointment. Furthermore, through these technologies, dentists can obtain a digital representation of the intraoral soft and hard tissues which allows patients to avoid the discomfort associated with traditional impressions. Thus, one of the greatest benefits of digital dentistry is the fact that this advancement has improved efficiency and accuracy while maintaining patient satisfaction and comfort.\n\n(5). It is important to note the wide scope of dentistry. This field has several specialties including orthodontics, periodontics, endodontics, prosthodontics, and oral and maxillofacial surgery, among others. Each specialty focuses on a specific area of dental care and requires specialized training and expertise. Since orthodontists focus on correcting mal-positioned teeth and misaligned bite patterns, aligners and retainers are commonly used in orthodontic treatments. By utilizing digital dentistry tools such CAD/CAM technology, orthodontists can create these dental devices with high precision and customization. Likewise, dentists specializing in prosthodontics can utilize these tools to create dental prostheses such as crowns, bridges, and dentures in a short amount of time. This has significantly reduced the need for multiple appointments and temporary restorations.\n\n(6). Oral and maxillofacial surgery, on the other hand, is a specialized field of dentistry that encompasses reconstructive surgery of the face, oral cavity, facial trauma surgery, and head, neck, mouth, and jaw anomalies. Additionally, oral and maxillofacial surgeons may also perform facial plastic and cosmetic procedures including cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries. Surgeons have used tools such as 3D printing to create surgical guides for dental implant placements. They have also been used to create models of the jaw and other structures when planning complex procedures. Furthermore, Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)- a radiographic imaging device, is often used by oral and maxillofacial surgeons to produce holistic 3D images of the facial bones and tissues. Supplementing this with other digital dentistry tools has allowed for accurate surgical planning and ease in post-treatment assessments. A more comprehensive list of the various dental specialties can be found in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: Dental Specialties\n\nDental Specialty\n\nDescription\n\nOrthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics\n\nProsthodontics\n\nPeriodontics\n\nEndodontics\n\nPediatric Dentistry\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Surgery\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Pathology\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Radiology\n\nDental Public Health\n\n(7). Technological innovations have permeated all fields of dentistry. Within dental public health and general dentistry, teledentistry has allowed practitioners to remotely diagnose and treat patients while promoting oral health awareness. These applications have been particularly useful in areas where large geographical distances limit access to oral health services for many people. Other technology such as the VELscope- a special light that is shone into the mouth of patients, has proven to help oral pathologists detect oral cancer and other abnormalities. Additionally, laser technology allows periodontists to remove infected tissue and stimulate healing without the need for invasive surgical procedures. Hence, regardless of the field of practice, dentists use technological advancements and the tools at their disposal to provide precise and customized services to their patients.\n\n(8). Nonetheless, there are limitations to these technologies. For starters, extensive post-processing is involved when dental devices are constructed using CAD/CAM technology. For example, the dental professional must remove the support structures often used by 3D printers when creating these devices. Other types of processing include cleaning the object of any debris, utilizing abrasive tools to smooth and polish the object, and finalizing the object by bonding different components together or applying protective coatings. Furthermore, 3D-printed objects can also be subjected to the “staircase effect” whereby the layer marks are distinctly visible as ridges. This can cause the object to obtain slight dimensional inaccuracies. In some cases, an object with these ridges may also have lower structural integrity and may become more susceptible to fractures. Additionally, despite significant progress in imaging technology, dental diagnostic tools such as the CBCT still lack the ability to capture a detailed depiction of certain soft tissue conditions. Thus, specific pathologies- including some head and neck infections, go undiagnosed. (9). Despite these limitations, research within artificial intelligence (AI) alludes to a promising future for digital dentistry and for dentistry as a whole.

Thus, one of the greatest benefits of digital dentistry is the fact that this advancement has improved efficiency and accuracy while maintaining patient satisfaction and comfort.\n\n(5). It is important to note the wide scope of dentistry. This field has several specialties including orthodontics, periodontics, endodontics, prosthodontics, and oral and maxillofacial surgery, among others. Each specialty focuses on a specific area of dental care and requires specialized training and expertise. Since orthodontists focus on correcting mal-positioned teeth and misaligned bite patterns, aligners and retainers are commonly used in orthodontic treatments. By utilizing digital dentistry tools such CAD/CAM technology, orthodontists can create these dental devices with high precision and customization. Likewise, dentists specializing in prosthodontics can utilize these tools to create dental prostheses such as crowns, bridges, and dentures in a short amount of time. This has significantly reduced the need for multiple appointments and temporary restorations.\n\n(6). Oral and maxillofacial surgery, on the other hand, is a specialized field of dentistry that encompasses reconstructive surgery of the face, oral cavity, facial trauma surgery, and head, neck, mouth, and jaw anomalies. Additionally, oral and maxillofacial surgeons may also perform facial plastic and cosmetic procedures including cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries. Surgeons have used tools such as 3D printing to create surgical guides for dental implant placements. They have also been used to create models of the jaw and other structures when planning complex procedures. Furthermore, Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)- a radiographic imaging device, is often used by oral and maxillofacial surgeons to produce holistic 3D images of the facial bones and tissues. Supplementing this with other digital dentistry tools has allowed for accurate surgical planning and ease in post-treatment assessments. A more comprehensive list of the various dental specialties can be found in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: Dental Specialties\n\nDental Specialty\n\nDescription\n\nOrthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics\n\nProsthodontics\n\nPeriodontics\n\nEndodontics\n\nPediatric Dentistry\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Surgery\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Pathology\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Radiology\n\nDental Public Health\n\n(7). Technological innovations have permeated all fields of dentistry. Within dental public health and general dentistry, teledentistry has allowed practitioners to remotely diagnose and treat patients while promoting oral health awareness. These applications have been particularly useful in areas where large geographical distances limit access to oral health services for many people. Other technology such as the VELscope- a special light that is shone into the mouth of patients, has proven to help oral pathologists detect oral cancer and other abnormalities. Additionally, laser technology allows periodontists to remove infected tissue and stimulate healing without the need for invasive surgical procedures. Hence, regardless of the field of practice, dentists use technological advancements and the tools at their disposal to provide precise and customized services to their patients.\n\n(8). Nonetheless, there are limitations to these technologies. For starters, extensive post-processing is involved when dental devices are constructed using CAD/CAM technology. For example, the dental professional must remove the support structures often used by 3D printers when creating these devices. Other types of processing include cleaning the object of any debris, utilizing abrasive tools to smooth and polish the object, and finalizing the object by bonding different components together or applying protective coatings. Furthermore, 3D-printed objects can also be subjected to the “staircase effect” whereby the layer marks are distinctly visible as ridges. This can cause the object to obtain slight dimensional inaccuracies. In some cases, an object with these ridges may also have lower structural integrity and may become more susceptible to fractures. Additionally, despite significant progress in imaging technology, dental diagnostic tools such as the CBCT still lack the ability to capture a detailed depiction of certain soft tissue conditions. Thus, specific pathologies- including some head and neck infections, go undiagnosed. (9). Despite these limitations, research within artificial intelligence (AI) alludes to a promising future for digital dentistry and for dentistry as a whole. In fact, recent advances in AI algorithms have resulted in improved 3D-printed models for diagnosis and treatment planning. Furthermore, such algorithms have been invaluable in assessing and predicting trends within dentistry which include caries risk assessments, orthodontic treatment outcomes, and oral disease progression. Such data can be used to advocate for necessary oral health policies. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated algorithms to improve the overall predictive power and accuracy of existing diagnostic tools. Additionally, integrating innovations such as virtual reality into dentistry and dental education can prove to be invaluable as it can improve treatment planning and assessment through realistic simulators. Evidently, the potential to advance dentistry through technology is limitless."

      "text": "(1). Dentistry has kept pace with recent technological innovations, particularly within the field of digital dentistry. With advances in imaging, manufacturing, and software integration, dentists are able to use computer-based tools to diagnose, carry-out dental procedures, and conduct follow-up assessments with higher efficiency and accuracy. As such, digital dentistry is replacing or supplementing traditional methods within this field.\n\n(2). A significant contribution to digital dentistry has been computer-aided design and manufacturing, known as CAD/CAM. Using CAD software, dentists convert non-digital data of their patient’s oral cavity into a digital format, apply necessary edits, and create the required physical materials using 3D printing or milling. The latter process of milling involves using a small cutting machine that automatically processes the material into the required dental device. 3D printing, on the other hand, involves creating a three-dimensional object from its digital model by systematically depositing layer upon layer of material. One of the earliest applications of 3D printing within dentistry involved creating study models which provided information on a patient’s dentition and occlusion. Even now, these models serve as invaluable visual aids for both dentists and patients. For the former, these replicas allow for the assessment of abnormalities and visualization of complex or unusual anatomical features. They are hence, used by dentists to conduct procedures with more accuracy and confidence. These models have also been useful in patient communication as they allow patients to visualize their treatment plans.\n\n(3). Amongst its many other applications, 3D printing technology is often used in indirect restorative procedures to perform complex restorations efficiently. When receiving such treatment, the dentist first prepares the site of restoration by removing decayed or damaged parts of the tooth in a process known as tooth preparation. Then, the dentist performs an intraoral scan using an optical scanner to digitally capture the tooth preparation and the surrounding teeth as a 3D image. Afterwards, the dentist uses CAD/CAM software to analyze the image and create the restorative design. Depending on the design, the dental practitioner may 3D print or use a milling machine to construct the restoration. If the dentist decides to use 3D printing, they will utilize different types of resins depending on the purpose and functionality of the dental device. On the other hand, if a milling machine is selected, it will utilize the restorative design to shape a block of ceramic into the desired crown, inlay, onlay, veneer, or bridge. After polishing the object to give it a more natural look, it is placed in the patient's mouth to complete the restorative procedure. Polishing is important as it minimizes the chances of plaque accumulation and protects the object from fracturing.\n\n(4). Notably, dental practices that own scanners, milling machines, and 3D printers can begin restorative treatments almost immediately. Compact millers which have recently entered the market allow dentists to scan, mill, and deliver restorations all within a single appointment.

This is rather discussed during the tooth preparation step when the author writes “…When receiving such treatment, the dentist first prepares the site of restoration by removing decayed or damaged parts of the tooth in a process known as tooth preparation.” (Paragraph 3). Option C. It makes the restorative object appear less natural – is incorrect because paragraph 3 states “After polishing the object to give it a more natural look, it is placed in the patient's mouth to complete the restorative procedure.” Thus, polishing allows the object to appear more natural, NOT less natural as this option claims. Option D. It results in an accurate 3D image of the surrounding teeth – is incorrect because paragraph 3 describes the importance of polishing as it gives the restorative object “…a more natural look […] Polishing is important as it minimizes the chances of plaque accumulation and protects the object from fracturing.” The author never attributes polishing to obtaining an accurate 3D image of the surrounding teeth.",

      "text": "(1). Dentistry has kept pace with recent technological innovations, particularly within the field of digital dentistry. With advances in imaging, manufacturing, and software integration, dentists are able to use computer-based tools to diagnose, carry-out dental procedures, and conduct follow-up assessments with higher efficiency and accuracy. As such, digital dentistry is replacing or supplementing traditional methods within this field.\n\n(2). A significant contribution to digital dentistry has been computer-aided design and manufacturing, known as CAD/CAM. Using CAD software, dentists convert non-digital data of their patient’s oral cavity into a digital format, apply necessary edits, and create the required physical materials using 3D printing or milling. The latter process of milling involves using a small cutting machine that automatically processes the material into the required dental device. 3D printing, on the other hand, involves creating a three-dimensional object from its digital model by systematically depositing layer upon layer of material. One of the earliest applications of 3D printing within dentistry involved creating study models which provided information on a patient’s dentition and occlusion. Even now, these models serve as invaluable visual aids for both dentists and patients. For the former, these replicas allow for the assessment of abnormalities and visualization of complex or unusual anatomical features. They are hence, used by dentists to conduct procedures with more accuracy and confidence. These models have also been useful in patient communication as they allow patients to visualize their treatment plans.\n\n(3). Amongst its many other applications, 3D printing technology is often used in indirect restorative procedures to perform complex restorations efficiently. When receiving such treatment, the dentist first prepares the site of restoration by removing decayed or damaged parts of the tooth in a process known as tooth preparation. Then, the dentist performs an intraoral scan using an optical scanner to digitally capture the tooth preparation and the surrounding teeth as a 3D image. Afterwards, the dentist uses CAD/CAM software to analyze the image and create the restorative design. Depending on the design, the dental practitioner may 3D print or use a milling machine to construct the restoration. If the dentist decides to use 3D printing, they will utilize different types of resins depending on the purpose and functionality of the dental device. On the other hand, if a milling machine is selected, it will utilize the restorative design to shape a block of ceramic into the desired crown, inlay, onlay, veneer, or bridge. After polishing the object to give it a more natural look, it is placed in the patient's mouth to complete the restorative procedure. Polishing is important as it minimizes the chances of plaque accumulation and protects the object from fracturing.\n\n(4). Notably, dental practices that own scanners, milling machines, and 3D printers can begin restorative treatments almost immediately. Compact millers which have recently entered the market allow dentists to scan, mill, and deliver restorations all within a single appointment. Furthermore, through these technologies, dentists can obtain a digital representation of the intraoral soft and hard tissues which allows patients to avoid the discomfort associated with traditional impressions. Thus, one of the greatest benefits of digital dentistry is the fact that this advancement has improved efficiency and accuracy while maintaining patient satisfaction and comfort.\n\n(5). It is important to note the wide scope of dentistry. This field has several specialties including orthodontics, periodontics, endodontics, prosthodontics, and oral and maxillofacial surgery, among others. Each specialty focuses on a specific area of dental care and requires specialized training and expertise. Since orthodontists focus on correcting mal-positioned teeth and misaligned bite patterns, aligners and retainers are commonly used in orthodontic treatments. By utilizing digital dentistry tools such CAD/CAM technology, orthodontists can create these dental devices with high precision and customization. Likewise, dentists specializing in prosthodontics can utilize these tools to create dental prostheses such as crowns, bridges, and dentures in a short amount of time. This has significantly reduced the need for multiple appointments and temporary restorations.\n\n(6). Oral and maxillofacial surgery, on the other hand, is a specialized field of dentistry that encompasses reconstructive surgery of the face, oral cavity, facial trauma surgery, and head, neck, mouth, and jaw anomalies. Additionally, oral and maxillofacial surgeons may also perform facial plastic and cosmetic procedures including cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries. Surgeons have used tools such as 3D printing to create surgical guides for dental implant placements. They have also been used to create models of the jaw and other structures when planning complex procedures. Furthermore, Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)- a radiographic imaging device, is often used by oral and maxillofacial surgeons to produce holistic 3D images of the facial bones and tissues. Supplementing this with other digital dentistry tools has allowed for accurate surgical planning and ease in post-treatment assessments. A more comprehensive list of the various dental specialties can be found in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: Dental Specialties\n\nDental Specialty\n\nDescription\n\nOrthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics\n\nProsthodontics\n\nPeriodontics\n\nEndodontics\n\nPediatric Dentistry\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Surgery\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Pathology\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Radiology\n\nDental Public Health\n\n(7). Technological innovations have permeated all fields of dentistry. Within dental public health and general dentistry, teledentistry has allowed practitioners to remotely diagnose and treat patients while promoting oral health awareness. These applications have been particularly useful in areas where large geographical distances limit access to oral health services for many people. Other technology such as the VELscope- a special light that is shone into the mouth of patients, has proven to help oral pathologists detect oral cancer and other abnormalities. Additionally, laser technology allows periodontists to remove infected tissue and stimulate healing without the need for invasive surgical procedures. Hence, regardless of the field of practice, dentists use technological advancements and the tools at their disposal to provide precise and customized services to their patients.\n\n(8). Nonetheless, there are limitations to these technologies. For starters, extensive post-processing is involved when dental devices are constructed using CAD/CAM technology. For example, the dental professional must remove the support structures often used by 3D printers when creating these devices. Other types of processing include cleaning the object of any debris, utilizing abrasive tools to smooth and polish the object, and finalizing the object by bonding different components together or applying protective coatings. Furthermore, 3D-printed objects can also be subjected to the “staircase effect” whereby the layer marks are distinctly visible as ridges. This can cause the object to obtain slight dimensional inaccuracies. In some cases, an object with these ridges may also have lower structural integrity and may become more susceptible to fractures. Additionally, despite significant progress in imaging technology, dental diagnostic tools such as the CBCT still lack the ability to capture a detailed depiction of certain soft tissue conditions. Thus, specific pathologies- including some head and neck infections, go undiagnosed. (9). Despite these limitations, research within artificial intelligence (AI) alludes to a promising future for digital dentistry and for dentistry as a whole. In fact, recent advances in AI algorithms have resulted in improved 3D-printed models for diagnosis and treatment planning. Furthermore, such algorithms have been invaluable in assessing and predicting trends within dentistry which include caries risk assessments, orthodontic treatment outcomes, and oral disease progression. Such data can be used to advocate for necessary oral health policies. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated algorithms to improve the overall predictive power and accuracy of existing diagnostic tools. Additionally, integrating innovations such as virtual reality into dentistry and dental education can prove to be invaluable as it can improve treatment planning and assessment through realistic simulators. Evidently, the potential to advance dentistry through technology is limitless."

      "text": "(1). Dentistry has kept pace with recent technological innovations, particularly within the field of digital dentistry. With advances in imaging, manufacturing, and software integration, dentists are able to use computer-based tools to diagnose, carry-out dental procedures, and conduct follow-up assessments with higher efficiency and accuracy. As such, digital dentistry is replacing or supplementing traditional methods within this field.\n\n(2). A significant contribution to digital dentistry has been computer-aided design and manufacturing, known as CAD/CAM. Using CAD software, dentists convert non-digital data of their patient’s oral cavity into a digital format, apply necessary edits, and create the required physical materials using 3D printing or milling. The latter process of milling involves using a small cutting machine that automatically processes the material into the required dental device. 3D printing, on the other hand, involves creating a three-dimensional object from its digital model by systematically depositing layer upon layer of material. One of the earliest applications of 3D printing within dentistry involved creating study models which provided information on a patient’s dentition and occlusion. Even now, these models serve as invaluable visual aids for both dentists and patients. For the former, these replicas allow for the assessment of abnormalities and visualization of complex or unusual anatomical features. They are hence, used by dentists to conduct procedures with more accuracy and confidence. These models have also been useful in patient communication as they allow patients to visualize their treatment plans.\n\n(3). Amongst its many other applications, 3D printing technology is often used in indirect restorative procedures to perform complex restorations efficiently. When receiving such treatment, the dentist first prepares the site of restoration by removing decayed or damaged parts of the tooth in a process known as tooth preparation. Then, the dentist performs an intraoral scan using an optical scanner to digitally capture the tooth preparation and the surrounding teeth as a 3D image. Afterwards, the dentist uses CAD/CAM software to analyze the image and create the restorative design. Depending on the design, the dental practitioner may 3D print or use a milling machine to construct the restoration. If the dentist decides to use 3D printing, they will utilize different types of resins depending on the purpose and functionality of the dental device. On the other hand, if a milling machine is selected, it will utilize the restorative design to shape a block of ceramic into the desired crown, inlay, onlay, veneer, or bridge. After polishing the object to give it a more natural look, it is placed in the patient's mouth to complete the restorative procedure. Polishing is important as it minimizes the chances of plaque accumulation and protects the object from fracturing.\n\n(4). Notably, dental practices that own scanners, milling machines, and 3D printers can begin restorative treatments almost immediately. Compact millers which have recently entered the market allow dentists to scan, mill, and deliver restorations all within a single appointment. Furthermore, through these technologies, dentists can obtain a digital representation of the intraoral soft and hard tissues which allows patients to avoid the discomfort associated with traditional impressions. Thus, one of the greatest benefits of digital dentistry is the fact that this advancement has improved efficiency and accuracy while maintaining patient satisfaction and comfort.\n\n(5). It is important to note the wide scope of dentistry. This field has several specialties including orthodontics, periodontics, endodontics, prosthodontics, and oral and maxillofacial surgery, among others. Each specialty focuses on a specific area of dental care and requires specialized training and expertise. Since orthodontists focus on correcting mal-positioned teeth and misaligned bite patterns, aligners and retainers are commonly used in orthodontic treatments. By utilizing digital dentistry tools such CAD/CAM technology, orthodontists can create these dental devices with high precision and customization. Likewise, dentists specializing in prosthodontics can utilize these tools to create dental prostheses such as crowns, bridges, and dentures in a short amount of time. This has significantly reduced the need for multiple appointments and temporary restorations.\n\n(6). Oral and maxillofacial surgery, on the other hand, is a specialized field of dentistry that encompasses reconstructive surgery of the face, oral cavity, facial trauma surgery, and head, neck, mouth, and jaw anomalies. Additionally, oral and maxillofacial surgeons may also perform facial plastic and cosmetic procedures including cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries. Surgeons have used tools such as 3D printing to create surgical guides for dental implant placements. They have also been used to create models of the jaw and other structures when planning complex procedures. Furthermore, Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)- a radiographic imaging device, is often used by oral and maxillofacial surgeons to produce holistic 3D images of the facial bones and tissues. Supplementing this with other digital dentistry tools has allowed for accurate surgical planning and ease in post-treatment assessments. A more comprehensive list of the various dental specialties can be found in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: Dental Specialties\n\nDental Specialty\n\nDescription\n\nOrthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics\n\nProsthodontics\n\nPeriodontics\n\nEndodontics\n\nPediatric Dentistry\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Surgery\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Pathology\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Radiology\n\nDental Public Health\n\n(7). Technological innovations have permeated all fields of dentistry. Within dental public health and general dentistry, teledentistry has allowed practitioners to remotely diagnose and treat patients while promoting oral health awareness. These applications have been particularly useful in areas where large geographical distances limit access to oral health services for many people. Other technology such as the VELscope- a special light that is shone into the mouth of patients, has proven to help oral pathologists detect oral cancer and other abnormalities. Additionally, laser technology allows periodontists to remove infected tissue and stimulate healing without the need for invasive surgical procedures. Hence, regardless of the field of practice, dentists use technological advancements and the tools at their disposal to provide precise and customized services to their patients.\n\n(8). Nonetheless, there are limitations to these technologies. For starters, extensive post-processing is involved when dental devices are constructed using CAD/CAM technology. For example, the dental professional must remove the support structures often used by 3D printers when creating these devices. Other types of processing include cleaning the object of any debris, utilizing abrasive tools to smooth and polish the object, and finalizing the object by bonding different components together or applying protective coatings. Furthermore, 3D-printed objects can also be subjected to the “staircase effect” whereby the layer marks are distinctly visible as ridges. This can cause the object to obtain slight dimensional inaccuracies. In some cases, an object with these ridges may also have lower structural integrity and may become more susceptible to fractures. Additionally, despite significant progress in imaging technology, dental diagnostic tools such as the CBCT still lack the ability to capture a detailed depiction of certain soft tissue conditions. Thus, specific pathologies- including some head and neck infections, go undiagnosed. (9). Despite these limitations, research within artificial intelligence (AI) alludes to a promising future for digital dentistry and for dentistry as a whole. In fact, recent advances in AI algorithms have resulted in improved 3D-printed models for diagnosis and treatment planning. Furthermore, such algorithms have been invaluable in assessing and predicting trends within dentistry which include caries risk assessments, orthodontic treatment outcomes, and oral disease progression. Such data can be used to advocate for necessary oral health policies. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated algorithms to improve the overall predictive power and accuracy of existing diagnostic tools. Additionally, integrating innovations such as virtual reality into dentistry and dental education can prove to be invaluable as it can improve treatment planning and assessment through realistic simulators.

If the dentist decides to use 3D printing, they will utilize different types of resins depending on the purpose and functionality of the dental device. On the other hand, if a milling machine is selected, it will utilize the restorative design to shape a block of ceramic into the desired crown, inlay, onlay, veneer, or bridge. After polishing the object to give it a more natural look, it is placed in the patient's mouth to complete the restorative procedure. Polishing is important as it minimizes the chances of plaque accumulation and protects the object from fracturing.\n\n(4). Notably, dental practices that own scanners, milling machines, and 3D printers can begin restorative treatments almost immediately. Compact millers which have recently entered the market allow dentists to scan, mill, and deliver restorations all within a single appointment. Furthermore, through these technologies, dentists can obtain a digital representation of the intraoral soft and hard tissues which allows patients to avoid the discomfort associated with traditional impressions. Thus, one of the greatest benefits of digital dentistry is the fact that this advancement has improved efficiency and accuracy while maintaining patient satisfaction and comfort.\n\n(5). It is important to note the wide scope of dentistry. This field has several specialties including orthodontics, periodontics, endodontics, prosthodontics, and oral and maxillofacial surgery, among others. Each specialty focuses on a specific area of dental care and requires specialized training and expertise. Since orthodontists focus on correcting mal-positioned teeth and misaligned bite patterns, aligners and retainers are commonly used in orthodontic treatments. By utilizing digital dentistry tools such CAD/CAM technology, orthodontists can create these dental devices with high precision and customization. Likewise, dentists specializing in prosthodontics can utilize these tools to create dental prostheses such as crowns, bridges, and dentures in a short amount of time. This has significantly reduced the need for multiple appointments and temporary restorations.\n\n(6). Oral and maxillofacial surgery, on the other hand, is a specialized field of dentistry that encompasses reconstructive surgery of the face, oral cavity, facial trauma surgery, and head, neck, mouth, and jaw anomalies. Additionally, oral and maxillofacial surgeons may also perform facial plastic and cosmetic procedures including cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries. Surgeons have used tools such as 3D printing to create surgical guides for dental implant placements. They have also been used to create models of the jaw and other structures when planning complex procedures. Furthermore, Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)- a radiographic imaging device, is often used by oral and maxillofacial surgeons to produce holistic 3D images of the facial bones and tissues. Supplementing this with other digital dentistry tools has allowed for accurate surgical planning and ease in post-treatment assessments. A more comprehensive list of the various dental specialties can be found in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: Dental Specialties\n\nDental Specialty\n\nDescription\n\nOrthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics\n\nProsthodontics\n\nPeriodontics\n\nEndodontics\n\nPediatric Dentistry\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Surgery\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Pathology\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Radiology\n\nDental Public Health\n\n(7). Technological innovations have permeated all fields of dentistry. Within dental public health and general dentistry, teledentistry has allowed practitioners to remotely diagnose and treat patients while promoting oral health awareness. These applications have been particularly useful in areas where large geographical distances limit access to oral health services for many people. Other technology such as the VELscope- a special light that is shone into the mouth of patients, has proven to help oral pathologists detect oral cancer and other abnormalities. Additionally, laser technology allows periodontists to remove infected tissue and stimulate healing without the need for invasive surgical procedures. Hence, regardless of the field of practice, dentists use technological advancements and the tools at their disposal to provide precise and customized services to their patients.\n\n(8). Nonetheless, there are limitations to these technologies. For starters, extensive post-processing is involved when dental devices are constructed using CAD/CAM technology. For example, the dental professional must remove the support structures often used by 3D printers when creating these devices. Other types of processing include cleaning the object of any debris, utilizing abrasive tools to smooth and polish the object, and finalizing the object by bonding different components together or applying protective coatings. Furthermore, 3D-printed objects can also be subjected to the “staircase effect” whereby the layer marks are distinctly visible as ridges. This can cause the object to obtain slight dimensional inaccuracies. In some cases, an object with these ridges may also have lower structural integrity and may become more susceptible to fractures. Additionally, despite significant progress in imaging technology, dental diagnostic tools such as the CBCT still lack the ability to capture a detailed depiction of certain soft tissue conditions. Thus, specific pathologies- including some head and neck infections, go undiagnosed. (9). Despite these limitations, research within artificial intelligence (AI) alludes to a promising future for digital dentistry and for dentistry as a whole. In fact, recent advances in AI algorithms have resulted in improved 3D-printed models for diagnosis and treatment planning. Furthermore, such algorithms have been invaluable in assessing and predicting trends within dentistry which include caries risk assessments, orthodontic treatment outcomes, and oral disease progression. Such data can be used to advocate for necessary oral health policies. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated algorithms to improve the overall predictive power and accuracy of existing diagnostic tools. Additionally, integrating innovations such as virtual reality into dentistry and dental education can prove to be invaluable as it can improve treatment planning and assessment through realistic simulators.

      "text": "(1). Dentistry has kept pace with recent technological innovations, particularly within the field of digital dentistry. With advances in imaging, manufacturing, and software integration, dentists are able to use computer-based tools to diagnose, carry-out dental procedures, and conduct follow-up assessments with higher efficiency and accuracy. As such, digital dentistry is replacing or supplementing traditional methods within this field.\n\n(2). A significant contribution to digital dentistry has been computer-aided design and manufacturing, known as CAD/CAM. Using CAD software, dentists convert non-digital data of their patient’s oral cavity into a digital format, apply necessary edits, and create the required physical materials using 3D printing or milling. The latter process of milling involves using a small cutting machine that automatically processes the material into the required dental device. 3D printing, on the other hand, involves creating a three-dimensional object from its digital model by systematically depositing layer upon layer of material. One of the earliest applications of 3D printing within dentistry involved creating study models which provided information on a patient’s dentition and occlusion. Even now, these models serve as invaluable visual aids for both dentists and patients. For the former, these replicas allow for the assessment of abnormalities and visualization of complex or unusual anatomical features. They are hence, used by dentists to conduct procedures with more accuracy and confidence. These models have also been useful in patient communication as they allow patients to visualize their treatment plans.\n\n(3). Amongst its many other applications, 3D printing technology is often used in indirect restorative procedures to perform complex restorations efficiently. When receiving such treatment, the dentist first prepares the site of restoration by removing decayed or damaged parts of the tooth in a process known as tooth preparation. Then, the dentist performs an intraoral scan using an optical scanner to digitally capture the tooth preparation and the surrounding teeth as a 3D image. Afterwards, the dentist uses CAD/CAM software to analyze the image and create the restorative design. Depending on the design, the dental practitioner may 3D print or use a milling machine to construct the restoration. If the dentist decides to use 3D printing, they will utilize different types of resins depending on the purpose and functionality of the dental device. On the other hand, if a milling machine is selected, it will utilize the restorative design to shape a block of ceramic into the desired crown, inlay, onlay, veneer, or bridge. After polishing the object to give it a more natural look, it is placed in the patient's mouth to complete the restorative procedure. Polishing is important as it minimizes the chances of plaque accumulation and protects the object from fracturing.\n\n(4). Notably, dental practices that own scanners, milling machines, and 3D printers can begin restorative treatments almost immediately. Compact millers which have recently entered the market allow dentists to scan, mill, and deliver restorations all within a single appointment. Furthermore, through these technologies, dentists can obtain a digital representation of the intraoral soft and hard tissues which allows patients to avoid the discomfort associated with traditional impressions. Thus, one of the greatest benefits of digital dentistry is the fact that this advancement has improved efficiency and accuracy while maintaining patient satisfaction and comfort.\n\n(5). It is important to note the wide scope of dentistry. This field has several specialties including orthodontics, periodontics, endodontics, prosthodontics, and oral and maxillofacial surgery, among others. Each specialty focuses on a specific area of dental care and requires specialized training and expertise. Since orthodontists focus on correcting mal-positioned teeth and misaligned bite patterns, aligners and retainers are commonly used in orthodontic treatments. By utilizing digital dentistry tools such CAD/CAM technology, orthodontists can create these dental devices with high precision and customization. Likewise, dentists specializing in prosthodontics can utilize these tools to create dental prostheses such as crowns, bridges, and dentures in a short amount of time. This has significantly reduced the need for multiple appointments and temporary restorations.\n\n(6). Oral and maxillofacial surgery, on the other hand, is a specialized field of dentistry that encompasses reconstructive surgery of the face, oral cavity, facial trauma surgery, and head, neck, mouth, and jaw anomalies.

They have also been used to create models of the jaw and other structures when planning complex procedures. Furthermore, Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)- a radiographic imaging device, is often used by oral and maxillofacial surgeons to produce holistic 3D images of the facial bones and tissues. Supplementing this with other digital dentistry tools has allowed for accurate surgical planning and ease in post-treatment assessments. A more comprehensive list of the various dental specialties can be found in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: Dental Specialties\n\nDental Specialty\n\nDescription\n\nOrthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics\n\nProsthodontics\n\nPeriodontics\n\nEndodontics\n\nPediatric Dentistry\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Surgery\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Pathology\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Radiology\n\nDental Public Health\n\n(7). Technological innovations have permeated all fields of dentistry. Within dental public health and general dentistry, teledentistry has allowed practitioners to remotely diagnose and treat patients while promoting oral health awareness. These applications have been particularly useful in areas where large geographical distances limit access to oral health services for many people. Other technology such as the VELscope- a special light that is shone into the mouth of patients, has proven to help oral pathologists detect oral cancer and other abnormalities. Additionally, laser technology allows periodontists to remove infected tissue and stimulate healing without the need for invasive surgical procedures. Hence, regardless of the field of practice, dentists use technological advancements and the tools at their disposal to provide precise and customized services to their patients.\n\n(8). Nonetheless, there are limitations to these technologies. For starters, extensive post-processing is involved when dental devices are constructed using CAD/CAM technology. For example, the dental professional must remove the support structures often used by 3D printers when creating these devices. Other types of processing include cleaning the object of any debris, utilizing abrasive tools to smooth and polish the object, and finalizing the object by bonding different components together or applying protective coatings. Furthermore, 3D-printed objects can also be subjected to the “staircase effect” whereby the layer marks are distinctly visible as ridges. This can cause the object to obtain slight dimensional inaccuracies. In some cases, an object with these ridges may also have lower structural integrity and may become more susceptible to fractures. Additionally, despite significant progress in imaging technology, dental diagnostic tools such as the CBCT still lack the ability to capture a detailed depiction of certain soft tissue conditions. Thus, specific pathologies- including some head and neck infections, go undiagnosed. (9). Despite these limitations, research within artificial intelligence (AI) alludes to a promising future for digital dentistry and for dentistry as a whole. In fact, recent advances in AI algorithms have resulted in improved 3D-printed models for diagnosis and treatment planning. Furthermore, such algorithms have been invaluable in assessing and predicting trends within dentistry which include caries risk assessments, orthodontic treatment outcomes, and oral disease progression. Such data can be used to advocate for necessary oral health policies. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated algorithms to improve the overall predictive power and accuracy of existing diagnostic tools. Additionally, integrating innovations such as virtual reality into dentistry and dental education can prove to be invaluable as it can improve treatment planning and assessment through realistic simulators.

[…] 3D-printed objects can also be subjected to the “staircase effect” whereby the layer marks are distinctly visible as ridges. This can cause the object to obtain slight dimensional inaccuracies.” Thus, due to the staircase effect, 3D-printed objects can obtain minor dimensional inaccuracies. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. There is minimal post-processing required – is incorrect because in paragraph 8 the author writes that “…there are limitations to these technologies. For starters, extensive post-processing is involved when dental devices are constructed using CAD/CAM technology. For example, the dental professional must remove the support structures often used by 3D printers when creating these devices.” Thus, the limitation is that there is extensive, NOT minimal, post-processing required when 3D printing technology is used in dentistry. Option B. 3D-printed objects can have invisible ridges – is incorrect because in paragraph 8 the author writes that “…there are limitations to these technologies. […] Furthermore, 3D-printed objects can also be subjected to the “staircase effect” whereby the layer marks are distinctly visible as ridges.” Thus, due to the staircase effect, 3D-printed objects can have visible, NOT invisible, ridges present. Option C. 3D-printed objects can have high structural integrity – is incorrect because in paragraph 8 the author writes that “…there are limitations to these technologies. […] Furthermore, 3D-printed objects can also be subjected to the “staircase effect” whereby the layer marks are distinctly visible as ridges. […] an object with these ridges may also have lower structural integrity and may become more susceptible to fractures.” Thus, the limitation is that 3D-printed objects can have lower, NOT high, structural integrity due to the staircase effect. Option E. Dentists have to bond different support structures to the 3D-printed object – is incorrect because in paragraph 8 the author writes that “…there are limitations to these technologies. […] For example, the dental professional must remove the support structures often used by 3D printers when creating these devices.” Dentists remove support structures, NOT bond them together as this option claims. Rather, dentists bond “…different components together…” (Paragraph 8) when finalizing the object, but there is no indication that these different components refer to to the support structures used in 3D printing. Thus, since this claim is inaccurate, it is incorrect.",

      "text": "(1). Dentistry has kept pace with recent technological innovations, particularly within the field of digital dentistry. With advances in imaging, manufacturing, and software integration, dentists are able to use computer-based tools to diagnose, carry-out dental procedures, and conduct follow-up assessments with higher efficiency and accuracy. As such, digital dentistry is replacing or supplementing traditional methods within this field.\n\n(2). A significant contribution to digital dentistry has been computer-aided design and manufacturing, known as CAD/CAM. Using CAD software, dentists convert non-digital data of their patient’s oral cavity into a digital format, apply necessary edits, and create the required physical materials using 3D printing or milling. The latter process of milling involves using a small cutting machine that automatically processes the material into the required dental device. 3D printing, on the other hand, involves creating a three-dimensional object from its digital model by systematically depositing layer upon layer of material. One of the earliest applications of 3D printing within dentistry involved creating study models which provided information on a patient’s dentition and occlusion. Even now, these models serve as invaluable visual aids for both dentists and patients. For the former, these replicas allow for the assessment of abnormalities and visualization of complex or unusual anatomical features. They are hence, used by dentists to conduct procedures with more accuracy and confidence. These models have also been useful in patient communication as they allow patients to visualize their treatment plans.\n\n(3). Amongst its many other applications, 3D printing technology is often used in indirect restorative procedures to perform complex restorations efficiently. When receiving such treatment, the dentist first prepares the site of restoration by removing decayed or damaged parts of the tooth in a process known as tooth preparation. Then, the dentist performs an intraoral scan using an optical scanner to digitally capture the tooth preparation and the surrounding teeth as a 3D image. Afterwards, the dentist uses CAD/CAM software to analyze the image and create the restorative design. Depending on the design, the dental practitioner may 3D print or use a milling machine to construct the restoration. If the dentist decides to use 3D printing, they will utilize different types of resins depending on the purpose and functionality of the dental device. On the other hand, if a milling machine is selected, it will utilize the restorative design to shape a block of ceramic into the desired crown, inlay, onlay, veneer, or bridge. After polishing the object to give it a more natural look, it is placed in the patient's mouth to complete the restorative procedure. Polishing is important as it minimizes the chances of plaque accumulation and protects the object from fracturing.\n\n(4). Notably, dental practices that own scanners, milling machines, and 3D printers can begin restorative treatments almost immediately. Compact millers which have recently entered the market allow dentists to scan, mill, and deliver restorations all within a single appointment. Furthermore, through these technologies, dentists can obtain a digital representation of the intraoral soft and hard tissues which allows patients to avoid the discomfort associated with traditional impressions. Thus, one of the greatest benefits of digital dentistry is the fact that this advancement has improved efficiency and accuracy while maintaining patient satisfaction and comfort.\n\n(5). It is important to note the wide scope of dentistry. This field has several specialties including orthodontics, periodontics, endodontics, prosthodontics, and oral and maxillofacial surgery, among others. Each specialty focuses on a specific area of dental care and requires specialized training and expertise. Since orthodontists focus on correcting mal-positioned teeth and misaligned bite patterns, aligners and retainers are commonly used in orthodontic treatments. By utilizing digital dentistry tools such CAD/CAM technology, orthodontists can create these dental devices with high precision and customization. Likewise, dentists specializing in prosthodontics can utilize these tools to create dental prostheses such as crowns, bridges, and dentures in a short amount of time. This has significantly reduced the need for multiple appointments and temporary restorations.\n\n(6). Oral and maxillofacial surgery, on the other hand, is a specialized field of dentistry that encompasses reconstructive surgery of the face, oral cavity, facial trauma surgery, and head, neck, mouth, and jaw anomalies. Additionally, oral and maxillofacial surgeons may also perform facial plastic and cosmetic procedures including cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries. Surgeons have used tools such as 3D printing to create surgical guides for dental implant placements. They have also been used to create models of the jaw and other structures when planning complex procedures. Furthermore, Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)- a radiographic imaging device, is often used by oral and maxillofacial surgeons to produce holistic 3D images of the facial bones and tissues. Supplementing this with other digital dentistry tools has allowed for accurate surgical planning and ease in post-treatment assessments. A more comprehensive list of the various dental specialties can be found in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: Dental Specialties\n\nDental Specialty\n\nDescription\n\nOrthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics\n\nProsthodontics\n\nPeriodontics\n\nEndodontics\n\nPediatric Dentistry\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Surgery\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Pathology\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Radiology\n\nDental Public Health\n\n(7). Technological innovations have permeated all fields of dentistry. Within dental public health and general dentistry, teledentistry has allowed practitioners to remotely diagnose and treat patients while promoting oral health awareness. These applications have been particularly useful in areas where large geographical distances limit access to oral health services for many people. Other technology such as the VELscope- a special light that is shone into the mouth of patients, has proven to help oral pathologists detect oral cancer and other abnormalities. Additionally, laser technology allows periodontists to remove infected tissue and stimulate healing without the need for invasive surgical procedures. Hence, regardless of the field of practice, dentists use technological advancements and the tools at their disposal to provide precise and customized services to their patients.\n\n(8). Nonetheless, there are limitations to these technologies. For starters, extensive post-processing is involved when dental devices are constructed using CAD/CAM technology. For example, the dental professional must remove the support structures often used by 3D printers when creating these devices. Other types of processing include cleaning the object of any debris, utilizing abrasive tools to smooth and polish the object, and finalizing the object by bonding different components together or applying protective coatings. Furthermore, 3D-printed objects can also be subjected to the “staircase effect” whereby the layer marks are distinctly visible as ridges. This can cause the object to obtain slight dimensional inaccuracies. In some cases, an object with these ridges may also have lower structural integrity and may become more susceptible to fractures. Additionally, despite significant progress in imaging technology, dental diagnostic tools such as the CBCT still lack the ability to capture a detailed depiction of certain soft tissue conditions. Thus, specific pathologies- including some head and neck infections, go undiagnosed. (9). Despite these limitations, research within artificial intelligence (AI) alludes to a promising future for digital dentistry and for dentistry as a whole. In fact, recent advances in AI algorithms have resulted in improved 3D-printed models for diagnosis and treatment planning. Furthermore, such algorithms have been invaluable in assessing and predicting trends within dentistry which include caries risk assessments, orthodontic treatment outcomes, and oral disease progression. Such data can be used to advocate for necessary oral health policies. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated algorithms to improve the overall predictive power and accuracy of existing diagnostic tools. Additionally, integrating innovations such as virtual reality into dentistry and dental education can prove to be invaluable as it can improve treatment planning and assessment through realistic simulators. Evidently, the potential to advance dentistry through technology is limitless."
