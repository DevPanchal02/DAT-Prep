      "text": "(1). Although global commitment to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic has increased significantly in recent years, the virus continues to spread with alarming speed. The transmission of HIV can occur through three mechanisms: sexual transmission, exposure to infected blood or blood products, or perinatal transmission (including breastfeeding). However, sexual intercourse is the predominant mode of transmission and accounts for approximately 80 percent of HIV infections. The likelihood of infection is heavily affected by social, cultural, and environmental factors that often differ markedly between and within regions and countries; although many people who know they are infected with HIV reduce their risk behaviors, studies from developed countries suggest that a substantial percentage of individuals nevertheless continue to engage in unprotected sex, leading to a growing pandemic of the virus. As such, simply spreading awareness is not proven to be as effective as other interventions.\n\n(2). By the end of 2005, an estimated 40 million people worldwide were living with HIV infection or disease, a notable rise from the 35 million infected with HIV in 2001. In 2005, close to 5 million new HIV infections and 3 million AIDS deaths occurred, more of both than in any previous year. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most affected by HIV/AIDS - however, the virus is now spreading rapidly in Asia and parts of Eastern Europe.\n\n(3). The epidemic has affected certain regions of the world disproportionately, and Sub-Saharan Africa remains by far the hardest-hit region. With only 10 percent of the world's population, it accounts for more than 75 percent of all HIV infections worldwide and more than 75 percent of AIDS-related deaths estimated for 2003. Asia and the Pacific, within which there are several large and populous countries, account for 7.4 million infections or 19.5 percent of the current burden of disease. Prevention and treatment efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia—regions that together represent 85 percent of all current infections—have dictated, and will continue to dictate, global trends in the burden of HIV and AIDS-related mortality.\n\n(4). Despite the rapid spread of HIV, several countries have achieved notable success in curbing its transmission. The extraordinary potential of HIV prevention is exemplified by such diverse efforts as Thailand's 100 percent condom program, Uganda's remarkable decrease in HIV prevalence, and the community-based syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Mwanza, Tanzania.\n\n(5). Successes also include the development and effective use of highly sensitive and specific HIV screening tests, which have virtually eliminated infection from the blood supply in the developed world and most parts of the developing world. In addition, the administration of a short course of nevirapine to mothers during labor and to newborns postpartum reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) by as much as 47 percent. However, recent data suggests that such short-term successes may be at the expense of resistance and viral failure once treatment is introduced after delivery.\n\n(6). Enormous advances in HIV/AIDS treatment regimens have fundamentally altered the natural history of the disease and have sharply reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality in countries where such treatments are accessible. The advent of antiretroviral drugs in the late 1980s began a revolution in the management of HIV, which is analogous to the use of penicillin for treating bacterial infections in the 1940s. The most notable advancement on the treatment front is the use of combination antiretroviral therapy, which is far more effective than the original standard of care using monotherapy. Recent declines in the price of combination antiretroviral therapy in developing countries, from $15,000 USD per year to less than $150 USD in some countries, have prompted numerous developing nations to introduce antiretroviral therapy through the public sector. Price declines also pose difficult questions regarding the optimal allocation of limited resources for HIV/AIDS and the potential impact on already strained healthcare infrastructures.\n\n(7). Obstacles blocking effective HIV control include a lack of rigorous evaluations, prevention, and care coverage. However, global efforts have not proved sufficient to control the spread of the pandemic or to extend the lives of the majority of those infected. The desired level of success has not yet been achieved, mainly because most people who could benefit from available control strategies, including treatment, do not have access to these resources. Modelers commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) determined that existing interventions could prevent 63 percent of all infections projected to occur between 2002 and 2010. Nonetheless, a 2003 survey of coverage revealed that fewer than one in five high-risk people had access to the most basic prevention services, including condoms, AIDS education, MTCT prevention, voluntary counselling, and testing (VCT), and harm reduction programs; WHO and UNAIDS estimate that only about 7 percent of the nearly 6 million people in need of treatment receive it, and the number of people who require antiretroviral therapy increases by 8,000 every day.\n\n(8). Current coverage shortfalls, combined with the relentless expansion of the epidemic, underscore the immediate need for rapid scale-up of prevention and treatment interventions—an imperative that the international community has acknowledged but one that remains to be realized after more than 15 years; however, the activities of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (a five-year, $15 billion USD initiative) suggest there is growing commitment towards tackling these issues. The latter aims to provide antiretroviral drugs for two million HIV-infected people, to prevent seven million new infections, to provide care for ten million individuals, and to develop increased health system capacity in Vietnam, Africa, and the Caribbean; although 15 countries are slated to receive support from the President's Emergency Plan, many countries most affected by HIV/AIDs, including Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe, are not included in the list of beneficiary countries.\n\n(9). Because antiretroviral therapy has historically been unavailable in most developing countries, national programs have lacked the means to undertake a comprehensive approach to HIV/AIDS. Therefore, control of the pandemic demands a two-front battle that emphasizes both prevention and care. Even though the prospect of greater access to treatment increases the feasibility of integrating prevention and care in resource-limited settings, it also raises new questions regarding the selection of optimal prevention programs to pair with treatment programs.\n\n(10). In addition to poor coverage of key interventions, perhaps the greatest challenge to effective global control is the lack of reliable evidence to guide the selection of interventions for specific areas or populations. In the same way that global policymakers are increasingly recognizing the need for rigorous evaluation of development programs to ensure their success and eliminate waste, the need for reliable scientific evaluations of AIDS control programs is equally paramount for the same reasons. There are simply not enough resources to do everything everywhere; choices must be made, and priorities set. In the HIV/AIDS field, this information deficit is especially pronounced concerning HIV prevention in general and prevention implemented at a population level. Currently, the allocation of resources for HIV/AIDS prevention is seldom evidence-based, primarily because of a lack of data on both the effectiveness and the cost of interventions.\n\n(11). Few evaluations have collected data specifically on HIV infection as an outcome. In the case of care and treatment, success and failure are more readily and rapidly apparent, leading to a substantial degree of auto-correction of ineffective policies. In contrast, concerning HIV prevention, it is unlikely that those infections that might have occurred in the absence of a prevention program would be monitored, thus reducing the meaningfulness of the auto-feedback cycle for prevention. This absence underscores the importance of proactive, rigorous evaluation to differentiate success from failure promptly. Sound evidence of the effectiveness of HIV prevention measures is important, considering the tendency of many governments and international aid agencies to avoid programs that address sexual behaviors, drug use, or cater to highly stigmatized and vulnerable populations.\n\n(12). Despite the glaring deficits in AIDS research, the magnitude and seriousness of the global pandemic call for action in the absence of definitive data. The lack of both contextual data and sound evidence regarding the effectiveness of HIV interventions hinders policymakers’ ability to tailor HIV interventions to the nature and stage of national epidemics; remediating this issue is necessary to address HIV/AIDS effectively. In the absence of such data, HIV/AIDS expenditures undoubtedly incorporate an unacceptable degree of waste; people are needlessly contracting HIV, and HIV-infected individuals are dying prematurely."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, locate the section of the text discussing those responsible for enacting laws and policies regarding HIV. If we note that it is found in paragraph 12, we should reread the entire paragraph carefully to ascertain whether our answer is contained within; indeed, the second sentence in paragraph 12 reads: “The lack of both contextual data and sound evidence regarding the effectiveness of HIV interventions hinders policymakers’ ability to tailor HIV interventions to the nature and stage of national epidemics.” If a lack of evidence is hindering the ability of lawmakers to tailor HIV interventions, then the best option for these individuals is to allocate more funding towards research into discovering the effectiveness of HIV interventions. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Develop people’s awareness on avoiding unsafe intercourse with infected individuals – is incorrect because, according to the first paragraph, “simply spreading awareness is not proven to be as effective as other interventions.” This would not be the best way to help control the HIV pandemic, as a substantial portion of people still engage in unprotected sex, despite knowing the risks. Option B. Allocate a larger budget into research for HIV treatment – is incorrect because, according to paragraph 7, “Obstacles to effective HIV control include lack of prevention, care coverage, and rigorous evaluations.” This does not mention a lack of funding for treatment research. Option C. Enforce stricter laws to prevent HIV transmission from infected individuals – is incorrect because while this may seem correct based on paragraph 1, the author does not hint at stricter laws being a potential way to curb HIV infections in the passage; since there is no evidence from the passage to support this option choice, it is incorrect.",

      "title": "Passage 1",
      "text": "(1). Although global commitment to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic has increased significantly in recent years, the virus continues to spread with alarming speed. The transmission of HIV can occur through three mechanisms: sexual transmission, exposure to infected blood or blood products, or perinatal transmission (including breastfeeding). However, sexual intercourse is the predominant mode of transmission and accounts for approximately 80 percent of HIV infections. The likelihood of infection is heavily affected by social, cultural, and environmental factors that often differ markedly between and within regions and countries; although many people who know they are infected with HIV reduce their risk behaviors, studies from developed countries suggest that a substantial percentage of individuals nevertheless continue to engage in unprotected sex, leading to a growing pandemic of the virus. As such, simply spreading awareness is not proven to be as effective as other interventions.\n\n(2). By the end of 2005, an estimated 40 million people worldwide were living with HIV infection or disease, a notable rise from the 35 million infected with HIV in 2001. In 2005, close to 5 million new HIV infections and 3 million AIDS deaths occurred, more of both than in any previous year. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most affected by HIV/AIDS - however, the virus is now spreading rapidly in Asia and parts of Eastern Europe.\n\n(3). The epidemic has affected certain regions of the world disproportionately, and Sub-Saharan Africa remains by far the hardest-hit region. With only 10 percent of the world's population, it accounts for more than 75 percent of all HIV infections worldwide and more than 75 percent of AIDS-related deaths estimated for 2003. Asia and the Pacific, within which there are several large and populous countries, account for 7.4 million infections or 19.5 percent of the current burden of disease. Prevention and treatment efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia—regions that together represent 85 percent of all current infections—have dictated, and will continue to dictate, global trends in the burden of HIV and AIDS-related mortality.\n\n(4). Despite the rapid spread of HIV, several countries have achieved notable success in curbing its transmission. The extraordinary potential of HIV prevention is exemplified by such diverse efforts as Thailand's 100 percent condom program, Uganda's remarkable decrease in HIV prevalence, and the community-based syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Mwanza, Tanzania.\n\n(5). Successes also include the development and effective use of highly sensitive and specific HIV screening tests, which have virtually eliminated infection from the blood supply in the developed world and most parts of the developing world. In addition, the administration of a short course of nevirapine to mothers during labor and to newborns postpartum reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) by as much as 47 percent. However, recent data suggests that such short-term successes may be at the expense of resistance and viral failure once treatment is introduced after delivery.\n\n(6). Enormous advances in HIV/AIDS treatment regimens have fundamentally altered the natural history of the disease and have sharply reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality in countries where such treatments are accessible. The advent of antiretroviral drugs in the late 1980s began a revolution in the management of HIV, which is analogous to the use of penicillin for treating bacterial infections in the 1940s. The most notable advancement on the treatment front is the use of combination antiretroviral therapy, which is far more effective than the original standard of care using monotherapy. Recent declines in the price of combination antiretroviral therapy in developing countries, from $15,000 USD per year to less than $150 USD in some countries, have prompted numerous developing nations to introduce antiretroviral therapy through the public sector. Price declines also pose difficult questions regarding the optimal allocation of limited resources for HIV/AIDS and the potential impact on already strained healthcare infrastructures.\n\n(7). Obstacles blocking effective HIV control include a lack of rigorous evaluations, prevention, and care coverage. However, global efforts have not proved sufficient to control the spread of the pandemic or to extend the lives of the majority of those infected. The desired level of success has not yet been achieved, mainly because most people who could benefit from available control strategies, including treatment, do not have access to these resources. Modelers commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) determined that existing interventions could prevent 63 percent of all infections projected to occur between 2002 and 2010. Nonetheless, a 2003 survey of coverage revealed that fewer than one in five high-risk people had access to the most basic prevention services, including condoms, AIDS education, MTCT prevention, voluntary counselling, and testing (VCT), and harm reduction programs; WHO and UNAIDS estimate that only about 7 percent of the nearly 6 million people in need of treatment receive it, and the number of people who require antiretroviral therapy increases by 8,000 every day.\n\n(8). Current coverage shortfalls, combined with the relentless expansion of the epidemic, underscore the immediate need for rapid scale-up of prevention and treatment interventions—an imperative that the international community has acknowledged but one that remains to be realized after more than 15 years; however, the activities of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (a five-year, $15 billion USD initiative) suggest there is growing commitment towards tackling these issues. The latter aims to provide antiretroviral drugs for two million HIV-infected people, to prevent seven million new infections, to provide care for ten million individuals, and to develop increased health system capacity in Vietnam, Africa, and the Caribbean; although 15 countries are slated to receive support from the President's Emergency Plan, many countries most affected by HIV/AIDs, including Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe, are not included in the list of beneficiary countries.\n\n(9). Because antiretroviral therapy has historically been unavailable in most developing countries, national programs have lacked the means to undertake a comprehensive approach to HIV/AIDS. Therefore, control of the pandemic demands a two-front battle that emphasizes both prevention and care. Even though the prospect of greater access to treatment increases the feasibility of integrating prevention and care in resource-limited settings, it also raises new questions regarding the selection of optimal prevention programs to pair with treatment programs.\n\n(10). In addition to poor coverage of key interventions, perhaps the greatest challenge to effective global control is the lack of reliable evidence to guide the selection of interventions for specific areas or populations. In the same way that global policymakers are increasingly recognizing the need for rigorous evaluation of development programs to ensure their success and eliminate waste, the need for reliable scientific evaluations of AIDS control programs is equally paramount for the same reasons. There are simply not enough resources to do everything everywhere; choices must be made, and priorities set. In the HIV/AIDS field, this information deficit is especially pronounced concerning HIV prevention in general and prevention implemented at a population level. Currently, the allocation of resources for HIV/AIDS prevention is seldom evidence-based, primarily because of a lack of data on both the effectiveness and the cost of interventions.\n\n(11). Few evaluations have collected data specifically on HIV infection as an outcome. In the case of care and treatment, success and failure are more readily and rapidly apparent, leading to a substantial degree of auto-correction of ineffective policies. In contrast, concerning HIV prevention, it is unlikely that those infections that might have occurred in the absence of a prevention program would be monitored, thus reducing the meaningfulness of the auto-feedback cycle for prevention. This absence underscores the importance of proactive, rigorous evaluation to differentiate success from failure promptly. Sound evidence of the effectiveness of HIV prevention measures is important, considering the tendency of many governments and international aid agencies to avoid programs that address sexual behaviors, drug use, or cater to highly stigmatized and vulnerable populations.\n\n(12). Despite the glaring deficits in AIDS research, the magnitude and seriousness of the global pandemic call for action in the absence of definitive data. The lack of both contextual data and sound evidence regarding the effectiveness of HIV interventions hinders policymakers’ ability to tailor HIV interventions to the nature and stage of national epidemics; remediating this issue is necessary to address HIV/AIDS effectively. In the absence of such data, HIV/AIDS expenditures undoubtedly incorporate an unacceptable degree of waste; people are needlessly contracting HIV, and HIV-infected individuals are dying prematurely."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, take note of the phrase “the reduction in mother-to-child HIV transmission” and the word “nevirapine” in the question itself. This tells us that, at least to some degree, nevirapine reduces HIV transmission during childbirth. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the drug is an example of a successful tool in fighting AIDS. Thus, we should locate the portion or portions of the passage that discuss successful means of battling the disease. If we note that these are paragraphs four and five, we should read each carefully to determine whether nevirapine is mentioned, and if so, what is the percentage of its success. Indeed, paragraph five tells us: “In addition, the administration of a short course of nevirapine to mothers during labor and to newborns postpartum reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) by as much as 47 percent .” This tells us that nevirapine reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission by up to 47 percent. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",

      "text": "(1). Although global commitment to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic has increased significantly in recent years, the virus continues to spread with alarming speed. The transmission of HIV can occur through three mechanisms: sexual transmission, exposure to infected blood or blood products, or perinatal transmission (including breastfeeding). However, sexual intercourse is the predominant mode of transmission and accounts for approximately 80 percent of HIV infections. The likelihood of infection is heavily affected by social, cultural, and environmental factors that often differ markedly between and within regions and countries; although many people who know they are infected with HIV reduce their risk behaviors, studies from developed countries suggest that a substantial percentage of individuals nevertheless continue to engage in unprotected sex, leading to a growing pandemic of the virus. As such, simply spreading awareness is not proven to be as effective as other interventions.\n\n(2). By the end of 2005, an estimated 40 million people worldwide were living with HIV infection or disease, a notable rise from the 35 million infected with HIV in 2001. In 2005, close to 5 million new HIV infections and 3 million AIDS deaths occurred, more of both than in any previous year. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most affected by HIV/AIDS - however, the virus is now spreading rapidly in Asia and parts of Eastern Europe.\n\n(3). The epidemic has affected certain regions of the world disproportionately, and Sub-Saharan Africa remains by far the hardest-hit region. With only 10 percent of the world's population, it accounts for more than 75 percent of all HIV infections worldwide and more than 75 percent of AIDS-related deaths estimated for 2003. Asia and the Pacific, within which there are several large and populous countries, account for 7.4 million infections or 19.5 percent of the current burden of disease. Prevention and treatment efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia—regions that together represent 85 percent of all current infections—have dictated, and will continue to dictate, global trends in the burden of HIV and AIDS-related mortality.\n\n(4). Despite the rapid spread of HIV, several countries have achieved notable success in curbing its transmission. The extraordinary potential of HIV prevention is exemplified by such diverse efforts as Thailand's 100 percent condom program, Uganda's remarkable decrease in HIV prevalence, and the community-based syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Mwanza, Tanzania.\n\n(5). Successes also include the development and effective use of highly sensitive and specific HIV screening tests, which have virtually eliminated infection from the blood supply in the developed world and most parts of the developing world. In addition, the administration of a short course of nevirapine to mothers during labor and to newborns postpartum reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) by as much as 47 percent. However, recent data suggests that such short-term successes may be at the expense of resistance and viral failure once treatment is introduced after delivery.\n\n(6). Enormous advances in HIV/AIDS treatment regimens have fundamentally altered the natural history of the disease and have sharply reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality in countries where such treatments are accessible. The advent of antiretroviral drugs in the late 1980s began a revolution in the management of HIV, which is analogous to the use of penicillin for treating bacterial infections in the 1940s. The most notable advancement on the treatment front is the use of combination antiretroviral therapy, which is far more effective than the original standard of care using monotherapy. Recent declines in the price of combination antiretroviral therapy in developing countries, from $15,000 USD per year to less than $150 USD in some countries, have prompted numerous developing nations to introduce antiretroviral therapy through the public sector. Price declines also pose difficult questions regarding the optimal allocation of limited resources for HIV/AIDS and the potential impact on already strained healthcare infrastructures.\n\n(7). Obstacles blocking effective HIV control include a lack of rigorous evaluations, prevention, and care coverage. However, global efforts have not proved sufficient to control the spread of the pandemic or to extend the lives of the majority of those infected. The desired level of success has not yet been achieved, mainly because most people who could benefit from available control strategies, including treatment, do not have access to these resources. Modelers commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) determined that existing interventions could prevent 63 percent of all infections projected to occur between 2002 and 2010. Nonetheless, a 2003 survey of coverage revealed that fewer than one in five high-risk people had access to the most basic prevention services, including condoms, AIDS education, MTCT prevention, voluntary counselling, and testing (VCT), and harm reduction programs; WHO and UNAIDS estimate that only about 7 percent of the nearly 6 million people in need of treatment receive it, and the number of people who require antiretroviral therapy increases by 8,000 every day.\n\n(8). Current coverage shortfalls, combined with the relentless expansion of the epidemic, underscore the immediate need for rapid scale-up of prevention and treatment interventions—an imperative that the international community has acknowledged but one that remains to be realized after more than 15 years; however, the activities of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (a five-year, $15 billion USD initiative) suggest there is growing commitment towards tackling these issues. The latter aims to provide antiretroviral drugs for two million HIV-infected people, to prevent seven million new infections, to provide care for ten million individuals, and to develop increased health system capacity in Vietnam, Africa, and the Caribbean; although 15 countries are slated to receive support from the President's Emergency Plan, many countries most affected by HIV/AIDs, including Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe, are not included in the list of beneficiary countries.\n\n(9). Because antiretroviral therapy has historically been unavailable in most developing countries, national programs have lacked the means to undertake a comprehensive approach to HIV/AIDS. Therefore, control of the pandemic demands a two-front battle that emphasizes both prevention and care. Even though the prospect of greater access to treatment increases the feasibility of integrating prevention and care in resource-limited settings, it also raises new questions regarding the selection of optimal prevention programs to pair with treatment programs.\n\n(10). In addition to poor coverage of key interventions, perhaps the greatest challenge to effective global control is the lack of reliable evidence to guide the selection of interventions for specific areas or populations. In the same way that global policymakers are increasingly recognizing the need for rigorous evaluation of development programs to ensure their success and eliminate waste, the need for reliable scientific evaluations of AIDS control programs is equally paramount for the same reasons. There are simply not enough resources to do everything everywhere; choices must be made, and priorities set. In the HIV/AIDS field, this information deficit is especially pronounced concerning HIV prevention in general and prevention implemented at a population level. Currently, the allocation of resources for HIV/AIDS prevention is seldom evidence-based, primarily because of a lack of data on both the effectiveness and the cost of interventions.\n\n(11). Few evaluations have collected data specifically on HIV infection as an outcome. In the case of care and treatment, success and failure are more readily and rapidly apparent, leading to a substantial degree of auto-correction of ineffective policies. In contrast, concerning HIV prevention, it is unlikely that those infections that might have occurred in the absence of a prevention program would be monitored, thus reducing the meaningfulness of the auto-feedback cycle for prevention. This absence underscores the importance of proactive, rigorous evaluation to differentiate success from failure promptly. Sound evidence of the effectiveness of HIV prevention measures is important, considering the tendency of many governments and international aid agencies to avoid programs that address sexual behaviors, drug use, or cater to highly stigmatized and vulnerable populations.\n\n(12). Despite the glaring deficits in AIDS research, the magnitude and seriousness of the global pandemic call for action in the absence of definitive data. The lack of both contextual data and sound evidence regarding the effectiveness of HIV interventions hinders policymakers’ ability to tailor HIV interventions to the nature and stage of national epidemics; remediating this issue is necessary to address HIV/AIDS effectively. In the absence of such data, HIV/AIDS expenditures undoubtedly incorporate an unacceptable degree of waste; people are needlessly contracting HIV, and HIV-infected individuals are dying prematurely."

      "text": "(1). Although global commitment to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic has increased significantly in recent years, the virus continues to spread with alarming speed. The transmission of HIV can occur through three mechanisms: sexual transmission, exposure to infected blood or blood products, or perinatal transmission (including breastfeeding). However, sexual intercourse is the predominant mode of transmission and accounts for approximately 80 percent of HIV infections. The likelihood of infection is heavily affected by social, cultural, and environmental factors that often differ markedly between and within regions and countries; although many people who know they are infected with HIV reduce their risk behaviors, studies from developed countries suggest that a substantial percentage of individuals nevertheless continue to engage in unprotected sex, leading to a growing pandemic of the virus. As such, simply spreading awareness is not proven to be as effective as other interventions.\n\n(2). By the end of 2005, an estimated 40 million people worldwide were living with HIV infection or disease, a notable rise from the 35 million infected with HIV in 2001. In 2005, close to 5 million new HIV infections and 3 million AIDS deaths occurred, more of both than in any previous year. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most affected by HIV/AIDS - however, the virus is now spreading rapidly in Asia and parts of Eastern Europe.\n\n(3). The epidemic has affected certain regions of the world disproportionately, and Sub-Saharan Africa remains by far the hardest-hit region. With only 10 percent of the world's population, it accounts for more than 75 percent of all HIV infections worldwide and more than 75 percent of AIDS-related deaths estimated for 2003. Asia and the Pacific, within which there are several large and populous countries, account for 7.4 million infections or 19.5 percent of the current burden of disease. Prevention and treatment efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia—regions that together represent 85 percent of all current infections—have dictated, and will continue to dictate, global trends in the burden of HIV and AIDS-related mortality.\n\n(4). Despite the rapid spread of HIV, several countries have achieved notable success in curbing its transmission. The extraordinary potential of HIV prevention is exemplified by such diverse efforts as Thailand's 100 percent condom program, Uganda's remarkable decrease in HIV prevalence, and the community-based syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Mwanza, Tanzania.\n\n(5). Successes also include the development and effective use of highly sensitive and specific HIV screening tests, which have virtually eliminated infection from the blood supply in the developed world and most parts of the developing world. In addition, the administration of a short course of nevirapine to mothers during labor and to newborns postpartum reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) by as much as 47 percent. However, recent data suggests that such short-term successes may be at the expense of resistance and viral failure once treatment is introduced after delivery.\n\n(6). Enormous advances in HIV/AIDS treatment regimens have fundamentally altered the natural history of the disease and have sharply reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality in countries where such treatments are accessible. The advent of antiretroviral drugs in the late 1980s began a revolution in the management of HIV, which is analogous to the use of penicillin for treating bacterial infections in the 1940s. The most notable advancement on the treatment front is the use of combination antiretroviral therapy, which is far more effective than the original standard of care using monotherapy. Recent declines in the price of combination antiretroviral therapy in developing countries, from $15,000 USD per year to less than $150 USD in some countries, have prompted numerous developing nations to introduce antiretroviral therapy through the public sector. Price declines also pose difficult questions regarding the optimal allocation of limited resources for HIV/AIDS and the potential impact on already strained healthcare infrastructures.\n\n(7). Obstacles blocking effective HIV control include a lack of rigorous evaluations, prevention, and care coverage. However, global efforts have not proved sufficient to control the spread of the pandemic or to extend the lives of the majority of those infected. The desired level of success has not yet been achieved, mainly because most people who could benefit from available control strategies, including treatment, do not have access to these resources. Modelers commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) determined that existing interventions could prevent 63 percent of all infections projected to occur between 2002 and 2010. Nonetheless, a 2003 survey of coverage revealed that fewer than one in five high-risk people had access to the most basic prevention services, including condoms, AIDS education, MTCT prevention, voluntary counselling, and testing (VCT), and harm reduction programs; WHO and UNAIDS estimate that only about 7 percent of the nearly 6 million people in need of treatment receive it, and the number of people who require antiretroviral therapy increases by 8,000 every day.\n\n(8).

By the end of 2005, an estimated 40 million people worldwide were living with HIV infection or disease, a notable rise from the 35 million infected with HIV in 2001. In 2005, close to 5 million new HIV infections and 3 million AIDS deaths occurred, more of both than in any previous year. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most affected by HIV/AIDS - however, the virus is now spreading rapidly in Asia and parts of Eastern Europe.\n\n(3). The epidemic has affected certain regions of the world disproportionately, and Sub-Saharan Africa remains by far the hardest-hit region. With only 10 percent of the world's population, it accounts for more than 75 percent of all HIV infections worldwide and more than 75 percent of AIDS-related deaths estimated for 2003. Asia and the Pacific, within which there are several large and populous countries, account for 7.4 million infections or 19.5 percent of the current burden of disease. Prevention and treatment efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia—regions that together represent 85 percent of all current infections—have dictated, and will continue to dictate, global trends in the burden of HIV and AIDS-related mortality.\n\n(4). Despite the rapid spread of HIV, several countries have achieved notable success in curbing its transmission. The extraordinary potential of HIV prevention is exemplified by such diverse efforts as Thailand's 100 percent condom program, Uganda's remarkable decrease in HIV prevalence, and the community-based syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Mwanza, Tanzania.\n\n(5). Successes also include the development and effective use of highly sensitive and specific HIV screening tests, which have virtually eliminated infection from the blood supply in the developed world and most parts of the developing world. In addition, the administration of a short course of nevirapine to mothers during labor and to newborns postpartum reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) by as much as 47 percent. However, recent data suggests that such short-term successes may be at the expense of resistance and viral failure once treatment is introduced after delivery.\n\n(6). Enormous advances in HIV/AIDS treatment regimens have fundamentally altered the natural history of the disease and have sharply reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality in countries where such treatments are accessible. The advent of antiretroviral drugs in the late 1980s began a revolution in the management of HIV, which is analogous to the use of penicillin for treating bacterial infections in the 1940s. The most notable advancement on the treatment front is the use of combination antiretroviral therapy, which is far more effective than the original standard of care using monotherapy. Recent declines in the price of combination antiretroviral therapy in developing countries, from $15,000 USD per year to less than $150 USD in some countries, have prompted numerous developing nations to introduce antiretroviral therapy through the public sector. Price declines also pose difficult questions regarding the optimal allocation of limited resources for HIV/AIDS and the potential impact on already strained healthcare infrastructures.\n\n(7). Obstacles blocking effective HIV control include a lack of rigorous evaluations, prevention, and care coverage. However, global efforts have not proved sufficient to control the spread of the pandemic or to extend the lives of the majority of those infected. The desired level of success has not yet been achieved, mainly because most people who could benefit from available control strategies, including treatment, do not have access to these resources. Modelers commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) determined that existing interventions could prevent 63 percent of all infections projected to occur between 2002 and 2010. Nonetheless, a 2003 survey of coverage revealed that fewer than one in five high-risk people had access to the most basic prevention services, including condoms, AIDS education, MTCT prevention, voluntary counselling, and testing (VCT), and harm reduction programs; WHO and UNAIDS estimate that only about 7 percent of the nearly 6 million people in need of treatment receive it, and the number of people who require antiretroviral therapy increases by 8,000 every day.\n\n(8). Current coverage shortfalls, combined with the relentless expansion of the epidemic, underscore the immediate need for rapid scale-up of prevention and treatment interventions—an imperative that the international community has acknowledged but one that remains to be realized after more than 15 years; however, the activities of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (a five-year, $15 billion USD initiative) suggest there is growing commitment towards tackling these issues. The latter aims to provide antiretroviral drugs for two million HIV-infected people, to prevent seven million new infections, to provide care for ten million individuals, and to develop increased health system capacity in Vietnam, Africa, and the Caribbean; although 15 countries are slated to receive support from the President's Emergency Plan, many countries most affected by HIV/AIDs, including Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe, are not included in the list of beneficiary countries.\n\n(9). Because antiretroviral therapy has historically been unavailable in most developing countries, national programs have lacked the means to undertake a comprehensive approach to HIV/AIDS. Therefore, control of the pandemic demands a two-front battle that emphasizes both prevention and care. Even though the prospect of greater access to treatment increases the feasibility of integrating prevention and care in resource-limited settings, it also raises new questions regarding the selection of optimal prevention programs to pair with treatment programs.\n\n(10). In addition to poor coverage of key interventions, perhaps the greatest challenge to effective global control is the lack of reliable evidence to guide the selection of interventions for specific areas or populations. In the same way that global policymakers are increasingly recognizing the need for rigorous evaluation of development programs to ensure their success and eliminate waste, the need for reliable scientific evaluations of AIDS control programs is equally paramount for the same reasons. There are simply not enough resources to do everything everywhere; choices must be made, and priorities set. In the HIV/AIDS field, this information deficit is especially pronounced concerning HIV prevention in general and prevention implemented at a population level. Currently, the allocation of resources for HIV/AIDS prevention is seldom evidence-based, primarily because of a lack of data on both the effectiveness and the cost of interventions.\n\n(11). Few evaluations have collected data specifically on HIV infection as an outcome. In the case of care and treatment, success and failure are more readily and rapidly apparent, leading to a substantial degree of auto-correction of ineffective policies. In contrast, concerning HIV prevention, it is unlikely that those infections that might have occurred in the absence of a prevention program would be monitored, thus reducing the meaningfulness of the auto-feedback cycle for prevention. This absence underscores the importance of proactive, rigorous evaluation to differentiate success from failure promptly. Sound evidence of the effectiveness of HIV prevention measures is important, considering the tendency of many governments and international aid agencies to avoid programs that address sexual behaviors, drug use, or cater to highly stigmatized and vulnerable populations.\n\n(12). Despite the glaring deficits in AIDS research, the magnitude and seriousness of the global pandemic call for action in the absence of definitive data. The lack of both contextual data and sound evidence regarding the effectiveness of HIV interventions hinders policymakers’ ability to tailor HIV interventions to the nature and stage of national epidemics; remediating this issue is necessary to address HIV/AIDS effectively. In the absence of such data, HIV/AIDS expenditures undoubtedly incorporate an unacceptable degree of waste; people are needlessly contracting HIV, and HIV-infected individuals are dying prematurely."

If we read the entire passage, we can determine that abstinence is not mentioned as an effective means of curbing HIV. In paragraph 1, the author mentions the statement below. This tells us that spreading awareness would not be an effective means of curbing the transmission of AIDS within any community. “Although many people who know they are infected with HIV reduce their risk behaviors, studies from developed countries suggest that a substantial percentage of individuals nonetheless continue to engage in unprotected sex, leading to a growing pandemic of the virus. As such, simply spreading awareness is not proven to be as effective as other interventions.” In paragraph 4, the author mentions the statement below but does not go into further detail; therefore, it cannot be known if this protocol would be effective outside of Uganda. “Uganda’s remarkable decrease in HIV prevalence” In paragraph 6, the author mentions the statement below but retroviral therapy is not cited as an effective means of curbing HIV. “advent of antiretroviral drugs in the late 1980s began a revolution in the management of HIV,” Returning to Paragraph 4, it mentions the statement below. As this has proven to be an effective means of curbing HIV, and condoms are a resource that does not require the village in question to have immediate access to medical care, condoms could be an effective solution that a health expert might suggest. “HIV prevention is exemplified by such diverse efforts as Thailand’s 100 percent condom program.” Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",

      "text": "(1). Although global commitment to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic has increased significantly in recent years, the virus continues to spread with alarming speed. The transmission of HIV can occur through three mechanisms: sexual transmission, exposure to infected blood or blood products, or perinatal transmission (including breastfeeding). However, sexual intercourse is the predominant mode of transmission and accounts for approximately 80 percent of HIV infections. The likelihood of infection is heavily affected by social, cultural, and environmental factors that often differ markedly between and within regions and countries; although many people who know they are infected with HIV reduce their risk behaviors, studies from developed countries suggest that a substantial percentage of individuals nevertheless continue to engage in unprotected sex, leading to a growing pandemic of the virus.

      "text": "(1). Although global commitment to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic has increased significantly in recent years, the virus continues to spread with alarming speed. The transmission of HIV can occur through three mechanisms: sexual transmission, exposure to infected blood or blood products, or perinatal transmission (including breastfeeding). However, sexual intercourse is the predominant mode of transmission and accounts for approximately 80 percent of HIV infections. The likelihood of infection is heavily affected by social, cultural, and environmental factors that often differ markedly between and within regions and countries; although many people who know they are infected with HIV reduce their risk behaviors, studies from developed countries suggest that a substantial percentage of individuals nevertheless continue to engage in unprotected sex, leading to a growing pandemic of the virus. As such, simply spreading awareness is not proven to be as effective as other interventions.\n\n(2). By the end of 2005, an estimated 40 million people worldwide were living with HIV infection or disease, a notable rise from the 35 million infected with HIV in 2001. In 2005, close to 5 million new HIV infections and 3 million AIDS deaths occurred, more of both than in any previous year. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most affected by HIV/AIDS - however, the virus is now spreading rapidly in Asia and parts of Eastern Europe.\n\n(3). The epidemic has affected certain regions of the world disproportionately, and Sub-Saharan Africa remains by far the hardest-hit region. With only 10 percent of the world's population, it accounts for more than 75 percent of all HIV infections worldwide and more than 75 percent of AIDS-related deaths estimated for 2003. Asia and the Pacific, within which there are several large and populous countries, account for 7.4 million infections or 19.5 percent of the current burden of disease. Prevention and treatment efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia—regions that together represent 85 percent of all current infections—have dictated, and will continue to dictate, global trends in the burden of HIV and AIDS-related mortality.\n\n(4). Despite the rapid spread of HIV, several countries have achieved notable success in curbing its transmission. The extraordinary potential of HIV prevention is exemplified by such diverse efforts as Thailand's 100 percent condom program, Uganda's remarkable decrease in HIV prevalence, and the community-based syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Mwanza, Tanzania.\n\n(5). Successes also include the development and effective use of highly sensitive and specific HIV screening tests, which have virtually eliminated infection from the blood supply in the developed world and most parts of the developing world. In addition, the administration of a short course of nevirapine to mothers during labor and to newborns postpartum reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) by as much as 47 percent. However, recent data suggests that such short-term successes may be at the expense of resistance and viral failure once treatment is introduced after delivery.\n\n(6). Enormous advances in HIV/AIDS treatment regimens have fundamentally altered the natural history of the disease and have sharply reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality in countries where such treatments are accessible. The advent of antiretroviral drugs in the late 1980s began a revolution in the management of HIV, which is analogous to the use of penicillin for treating bacterial infections in the 1940s. The most notable advancement on the treatment front is the use of combination antiretroviral therapy, which is far more effective than the original standard of care using monotherapy. Recent declines in the price of combination antiretroviral therapy in developing countries, from $15,000 USD per year to less than $150 USD in some countries, have prompted numerous developing nations to introduce antiretroviral therapy through the public sector. Price declines also pose difficult questions regarding the optimal allocation of limited resources for HIV/AIDS and the potential impact on already strained healthcare infrastructures.\n\n(7). Obstacles blocking effective HIV control include a lack of rigorous evaluations, prevention, and care coverage. However, global efforts have not proved sufficient to control the spread of the pandemic or to extend the lives of the majority of those infected. The desired level of success has not yet been achieved, mainly because most people who could benefit from available control strategies, including treatment, do not have access to these resources. Modelers commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) determined that existing interventions could prevent 63 percent of all infections projected to occur between 2002 and 2010. Nonetheless, a 2003 survey of coverage revealed that fewer than one in five high-risk people had access to the most basic prevention services, including condoms, AIDS education, MTCT prevention, voluntary counselling, and testing (VCT), and harm reduction programs; WHO and UNAIDS estimate that only about 7 percent of the nearly 6 million people in need of treatment receive it, and the number of people who require antiretroviral therapy increases by 8,000 every day.\n\n(8). Current coverage shortfalls, combined with the relentless expansion of the epidemic, underscore the immediate need for rapid scale-up of prevention and treatment interventions—an imperative that the international community has acknowledged but one that remains to be realized after more than 15 years; however, the activities of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (a five-year, $15 billion USD initiative) suggest there is growing commitment towards tackling these issues. The latter aims to provide antiretroviral drugs for two million HIV-infected people, to prevent seven million new infections, to provide care for ten million individuals, and to develop increased health system capacity in Vietnam, Africa, and the Caribbean; although 15 countries are slated to receive support from the President's Emergency Plan, many countries most affected by HIV/AIDs, including Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe, are not included in the list of beneficiary countries.\n\n(9). Because antiretroviral therapy has historically been unavailable in most developing countries, national programs have lacked the means to undertake a comprehensive approach to HIV/AIDS. Therefore, control of the pandemic demands a two-front battle that emphasizes both prevention and care. Even though the prospect of greater access to treatment increases the feasibility of integrating prevention and care in resource-limited settings, it also raises new questions regarding the selection of optimal prevention programs to pair with treatment programs.\n\n(10). In addition to poor coverage of key interventions, perhaps the greatest challenge to effective global control is the lack of reliable evidence to guide the selection of interventions for specific areas or populations. In the same way that global policymakers are increasingly recognizing the need for rigorous evaluation of development programs to ensure their success and eliminate waste, the need for reliable scientific evaluations of AIDS control programs is equally paramount for the same reasons. There are simply not enough resources to do everything everywhere; choices must be made, and priorities set. In the HIV/AIDS field, this information deficit is especially pronounced concerning HIV prevention in general and prevention implemented at a population level. Currently, the allocation of resources for HIV/AIDS prevention is seldom evidence-based, primarily because of a lack of data on both the effectiveness and the cost of interventions.\n\n(11). Few evaluations have collected data specifically on HIV infection as an outcome. In the case of care and treatment, success and failure are more readily and rapidly apparent, leading to a substantial degree of auto-correction of ineffective policies. In contrast, concerning HIV prevention, it is unlikely that those infections that might have occurred in the absence of a prevention program would be monitored, thus reducing the meaningfulness of the auto-feedback cycle for prevention. This absence underscores the importance of proactive, rigorous evaluation to differentiate success from failure promptly. Sound evidence of the effectiveness of HIV prevention measures is important, considering the tendency of many governments and international aid agencies to avoid programs that address sexual behaviors, drug use, or cater to highly stigmatized and vulnerable populations.\n\n(12). Despite the glaring deficits in AIDS research, the magnitude and seriousness of the global pandemic call for action in the absence of definitive data. The lack of both contextual data and sound evidence regarding the effectiveness of HIV interventions hinders policymakers’ ability to tailor HIV interventions to the nature and stage of national epidemics; remediating this issue is necessary to address HIV/AIDS effectively. In the absence of such data, HIV/AIDS expenditures undoubtedly incorporate an unacceptable degree of waste; people are needlessly contracting HIV, and HIV-infected individuals are dying prematurely."

The latter aims to provide antiretroviral drugs for two million HIV-infected people, to prevent seven million new infections, to provide care for ten million individuals, and to develop increased health system capacity in Vietnam, Africa, and the Caribbean; although 15 countries are slated to receive support from the President's Emergency Plan, many countries most affected by HIV/AIDs, including Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe, are not included in the list of beneficiary countries.\n\n(9). Because antiretroviral therapy has historically been unavailable in most developing countries, national programs have lacked the means to undertake a comprehensive approach to HIV/AIDS. Therefore, control of the pandemic demands a two-front battle that emphasizes both prevention and care. Even though the prospect of greater access to treatment increases the feasibility of integrating prevention and care in resource-limited settings, it also raises new questions regarding the selection of optimal prevention programs to pair with treatment programs.\n\n(10). In addition to poor coverage of key interventions, perhaps the greatest challenge to effective global control is the lack of reliable evidence to guide the selection of interventions for specific areas or populations. In the same way that global policymakers are increasingly recognizing the need for rigorous evaluation of development programs to ensure their success and eliminate waste, the need for reliable scientific evaluations of AIDS control programs is equally paramount for the same reasons. There are simply not enough resources to do everything everywhere; choices must be made, and priorities set. In the HIV/AIDS field, this information deficit is especially pronounced concerning HIV prevention in general and prevention implemented at a population level. Currently, the allocation of resources for HIV/AIDS prevention is seldom evidence-based, primarily because of a lack of data on both the effectiveness and the cost of interventions.\n\n(11). Few evaluations have collected data specifically on HIV infection as an outcome. In the case of care and treatment, success and failure are more readily and rapidly apparent, leading to a substantial degree of auto-correction of ineffective policies. In contrast, concerning HIV prevention, it is unlikely that those infections that might have occurred in the absence of a prevention program would be monitored, thus reducing the meaningfulness of the auto-feedback cycle for prevention. This absence underscores the importance of proactive, rigorous evaluation to differentiate success from failure promptly. Sound evidence of the effectiveness of HIV prevention measures is important, considering the tendency of many governments and international aid agencies to avoid programs that address sexual behaviors, drug use, or cater to highly stigmatized and vulnerable populations.\n\n(12). Despite the glaring deficits in AIDS research, the magnitude and seriousness of the global pandemic call for action in the absence of definitive data. The lack of both contextual data and sound evidence regarding the effectiveness of HIV interventions hinders policymakers’ ability to tailor HIV interventions to the nature and stage of national epidemics; remediating this issue is necessary to address HIV/AIDS effectively. In the absence of such data, HIV/AIDS expenditures undoubtedly incorporate an unacceptable degree of waste; people are needlessly contracting HIV, and HIV-infected individuals are dying prematurely."

Antiretroviral therapy – is incorrect because the author cites antiretroviral therapy as the most “notable advancement” in HIV treatment, not the original standard of care. Option C. Penicillin – is incorrect because penicillin is only mentioned in paragraph 6 as analogous to the use of antiretroviral drugs in the late 1980s since it also began a revolution for treating bacterial infections in the 1940s; this does not imply that penicillin was the original standard of HIV care. Option D. Combinational Retroviral therapy – is incorrect because, while this may seem correct, the author says that “the most notable advance on the treatment front is the use of combination antiretroviral therapy.” Firstly, combination antiretroviral therapy was the cutting-edge technology in HIV treatment, not the original standard of care.

      "text": "(1). The discovery of the double helix, the twisted-ladder structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), by James Watson and Francis Crick, marked a milestone in the history of science and gave rise to modern molecular biology, which is mainly concerned with understanding how genes control the chemical processes within cells. In short order, Watson and Crick’s discovery yielded ground-breaking insights into the genetic code and protein synthesis. During the 1970s and 1980s, it helped produce new and powerful scientific techniques, specifically recombinant DNA research, genetic engineering, rapid gene sequencing, and monoclonal antibodies. These are techniques on which today's multi-billion-dollar biotechnology industry is founded. Current advances in science all have their origins in Watson and Crick's inspired work, namely genetic fingerprinting and modern forensics, the mapping of the human genome, and the promise - yet unfulfilled - of gene therapy. The double helix has not only reshaped biology but has become a cultural icon, represented in sculpture, visual art, jewelry, and toys.\n\n(2). Researchers working on DNA in the early 1950s used the term \"gene\" to mean the smallest unit of genetic information. At the time, it was unknown what a gene looked like structurally and chemically or how it was copied, with very few errors, generation after generation. In 1944, Oswald Avery had shown that DNA was the \"transforming principle,\" the carrier of hereditary information, in pneumococcal bacteria. Nevertheless, most scientists continued to believe that DNA had a structure too uniform and simple to store genetic information for making complex living organisms. The genetic material, they reasoned, must consist of proteins: much more diverse and intricate molecules known to perform several biological functions in the cell. Crick and Watson recognized at an early stage in their careers that gaining a detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional configuration of the gene was the central problem in molecular biology; heredity and reproduction could not be understood without such knowledge. Watson and Crick seized on this problem during their very first encounter in the summer of 1951 and pursued it with a single-minded focus over the next eighteen months. The problem at hand meant taking on the arduous intellectual task of immersing themselves in all the fields of science involved: genetics, biochemistry, chemistry, physical chemistry, and X-ray crystallography. Drawing on the experimental results of others, taking advantage of their complementary scientific backgrounds in physics and X-ray crystallography (Crick) and viral and bacterial genetics (Watson), and relying on their brilliant intuition, persistence, and luck, the two showed that DNA had a structure sufficiently complex and yet elegantly simple enough to be the master molecule of life.\n\n(3). Other researchers had made important but seemingly unconnected findings on the composition of DNA, but it fell to Watson and Crick to unify these disparate findings into a coherent theory of genetic transfer. The organic chemist Alexander Todd determined that the backbone of the DNA molecule contained repeating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups. The biochemist Erwin Chargaff found that, while the amount of DNA and its four types of bases—the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine (T)—varied widely from species to species, A and T always appeared in ratios of one-to-one, as did G and C. Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin had obtained high-resolution X-ray images of DNA fibers that suggested a helical, corkscrew-like shape. Linus Pauling, the world's leading physical chemist at the time, had recently discovered the single-stranded alpha helix, the structure found in many proteins, prompting biologists to think of helical forms. Moreover, he pioneered the method of model building in chemistry by which Watson and Crick were to eventually uncover the structure of DNA. Indeed, Crick and Watson feared that they would be upstaged by Pauling, who proposed his model of DNA in February 1953, although his three-stranded helical structure quickly proved erroneous.\n\n(4). Linus Pauling was unsuccessful in his endeavor to become the first individual to determine the true structure of DNA, owing to the fact that the model he introduced in 1953 was fraught with serious errors. Pauling presented a triple helix model, thus failing to adhere to the findings of chemist Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography images had previously provided insight into the two-stranded nature of DNA. Pauling also suggested that the helix’s negatively charged phosphate groups are found on its inside, while its bases are located on its outside. The opposite is actually true, with the phosphate groups located on the outside of the helix and the bases facing inward. Lastly, Pauling failed to fully consider the hydrogen bonding patterns between the helix’s nucleotide bases. As such, he was unable to claim victory in the race to discover DNA’s true structure.\n\n(5). After several failed attempts at model building, including their ill-fated three-stranded model and one in which the bases were paired like-with-like (adenine with adenine, etc.), Watson and Crick achieved their breakthrough. Jerry Donohue, a visiting physical chemist from the United States who shared Watson and Crick's office for the year, pointed out that the configuration for the rings of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (the elements of all four bases) in thymine and guanine given in most textbooks of chemistry was incorrect. On February 28, 1953, Watson, acting on Donohue's advice, put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models. While shifting around the cardboard cut-outs of the accurate molecules on his office table, Watson realized in a stroke of inspiration that A, when joined with T, very nearly resembled a combination of C and G, and that each pair could hold together by forming hydrogen bonds. If A always paired with T, and likewise C with G, then not only were Chargaff's rules (that in DNA, the amount of A equals that of T, and C that of G) accounted for, but the pairs could be neatly fitted between the two helical sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA, the outside rails of the ladder. The bases connected to the two backbones at right angles while the backbones retained their regular shape as they wound around a common axis; similarly, the complementary pairing of the bases was compatible with the backbones, which ran in opposite directions to each other.\n\n(6). Watson and Crick published their findings in a one-page paper, with the understated title, \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,\" in the British scientific weekly, Nature, on April 25, 1953, illustrated with a schematic drawing of the double helix by Crick's wife, Odile. A coin toss decided the order in which they were named as authors. Foremost among the \"novel features\" of \"considerable biological interest\" they described was the pairing of the bases on the inside of the two DNA backbones: A=T and C=G. The pairing rule immediately suggested a copying mechanism for DNA: given the sequence of the bases in one strand, that of the other was automatically determined, which meant that when the two chains separated, each served as a template for a complementary new chain. Watson and Crick developed their ideas about genetic replication in the second article in Nature, published on May 30, 1953.\n\n(7). The two had shown that in DNA, form is function: the double-stranded molecule could both produce exact copies of itself and carry genetic instructions. During the following years, Crick elaborated on the implications of the double-helical model, advancing the hypothesis - revolutionary then but widely accepted since - that the sequence of the bases in DNA forms a code by which genetic information can be stored and transmitted. Although recognized today as one of the seminal scientific papers of the twentieth century, Watson and Crick's original article in Nature was not frequently cited at first; its true significance became apparent, and its circulation widened only towards the end of the 1950s. The structure of DNA they had proposed was shown to provide a mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, and when their conclusions were confirmed in the laboratory by Matthew Meselson, Crick himself immediately understood the significance of his and Watson's discovery. As Watson recalled, after their conceptual breakthrough on February 28, 1953, Crick declared to the assembled lunch patrons at The Eagle that they had \"found the secret of life.\" Crick himself had no memory of such an announcement but did recall telling his wife that evening \"that we seemed to have made a big discovery.\" Crick revealed that \"years later, she told me that she hadn't believed a word of it.\" He recounted that she said, \"You were always coming home and saying things like that, so naturally, I thought nothing of it.\"\n\n(8). Retrospective accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA have continued to elicit a measure of controversy. Crick was incensed at Watson's depiction of their collaboration in The Double Helix (1968), castigating the book as a betrayal of their friendship, an intrusion into Crick’s privacy, and a distortion of his (Crick’s) motives. Crick waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent its publication, but he eventually reconciled himself to the existence of Watson's bestseller, concluding that if it presented an unfavorable portrait of a scientist, it was of Watson, not of himself.\n\n(9). A more enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of Rosalind Franklin's crystallographic evidence of the structure of DNA, shown to them without her knowledge by her estranged colleagues. Franklin’s evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel. Franklin's superb experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery, yet they gave her scant acknowledgment; even so, Franklin bore no resentment towards them. She had presented her findings at a public seminar to which she had invited the two, and she soon left DNA research to study the tobacco mosaic virus. Franklin became friends with both Watson and Crick and spent her last period of remission from ovarian cancer in Crick's house. Crick believed that he and Watson used Franklin’s evidence appropriately while also admitting that their patronizing attitude towards Franklin, as depicted in The Double Helix, reflected contemporary conventions of gender in science.\n\n(10). Numerous examples show how Watson’s depiction of Rosalind Franklin in The Double Helix reflects mid-century attitudes towards women scientists. In addition to referring to Franklin in a scornful manner, Watson attempts to subvert the fact of her scientific prowess by focusing more on her personal character, which he portrays as cheerless and somewhat volatile, rather than emphasizing her workplace contributions. Although Franklin undoubtedly played an essential role in understanding the true structure of DNA, in his book Watson devalues her input in favor of his own and Crick’s, illustrating how the 1950s were a time in which women’s scholarly work was considered inherently less valuable than that of men. Importantly, Watson’s discriminatory depiction of Franklin in The Double Helix also highlights the crucial need for contemporary audiences to recognize how gender bias influences historical narratives, both scientific and otherwise."

      "text": "(1). The discovery of the double helix, the twisted-ladder structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), by James Watson and Francis Crick, marked a milestone in the history of science and gave rise to modern molecular biology, which is mainly concerned with understanding how genes control the chemical processes within cells. In short order, Watson and Crick’s discovery yielded ground-breaking insights into the genetic code and protein synthesis. During the 1970s and 1980s, it helped produce new and powerful scientific techniques, specifically recombinant DNA research, genetic engineering, rapid gene sequencing, and monoclonal antibodies. These are techniques on which today's multi-billion-dollar biotechnology industry is founded. Current advances in science all have their origins in Watson and Crick's inspired work, namely genetic fingerprinting and modern forensics, the mapping of the human genome, and the promise - yet unfulfilled - of gene therapy. The double helix has not only reshaped biology but has become a cultural icon, represented in sculpture, visual art, jewelry, and toys.\n\n(2). Researchers working on DNA in the early 1950s used the term \"gene\" to mean the smallest unit of genetic information. At the time, it was unknown what a gene looked like structurally and chemically or how it was copied, with very few errors, generation after generation. In 1944, Oswald Avery had shown that DNA was the \"transforming principle,\" the carrier of hereditary information, in pneumococcal bacteria. Nevertheless, most scientists continued to believe that DNA had a structure too uniform and simple to store genetic information for making complex living organisms. The genetic material, they reasoned, must consist of proteins: much more diverse and intricate molecules known to perform several biological functions in the cell. Crick and Watson recognized at an early stage in their careers that gaining a detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional configuration of the gene was the central problem in molecular biology; heredity and reproduction could not be understood without such knowledge. Watson and Crick seized on this problem during their very first encounter in the summer of 1951 and pursued it with a single-minded focus over the next eighteen months. The problem at hand meant taking on the arduous intellectual task of immersing themselves in all the fields of science involved: genetics, biochemistry, chemistry, physical chemistry, and X-ray crystallography. Drawing on the experimental results of others, taking advantage of their complementary scientific backgrounds in physics and X-ray crystallography (Crick) and viral and bacterial genetics (Watson), and relying on their brilliant intuition, persistence, and luck, the two showed that DNA had a structure sufficiently complex and yet elegantly simple enough to be the master molecule of life.\n\n(3). Other researchers had made important but seemingly unconnected findings on the composition of DNA, but it fell to Watson and Crick to unify these disparate findings into a coherent theory of genetic transfer. The organic chemist Alexander Todd determined that the backbone of the DNA molecule contained repeating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups. The biochemist Erwin Chargaff found that, while the amount of DNA and its four types of bases—the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine (T)—varied widely from species to species, A and T always appeared in ratios of one-to-one, as did G and C. Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin had obtained high-resolution X-ray images of DNA fibers that suggested a helical, corkscrew-like shape. Linus Pauling, the world's leading physical chemist at the time, had recently discovered the single-stranded alpha helix, the structure found in many proteins, prompting biologists to think of helical forms. Moreover, he pioneered the method of model building in chemistry by which Watson and Crick were to eventually uncover the structure of DNA. Indeed, Crick and Watson feared that they would be upstaged by Pauling, who proposed his model of DNA in February 1953, although his three-stranded helical structure quickly proved erroneous.\n\n(4). Linus Pauling was unsuccessful in his endeavor to become the first individual to determine the true structure of DNA, owing to the fact that the model he introduced in 1953 was fraught with serious errors. Pauling presented a triple helix model, thus failing to adhere to the findings of chemist Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography images had previously provided insight into the two-stranded nature of DNA. Pauling also suggested that the helix’s negatively charged phosphate groups are found on its inside, while its bases are located on its outside. The opposite is actually true, with the phosphate groups located on the outside of the helix and the bases facing inward. Lastly, Pauling failed to fully consider the hydrogen bonding patterns between the helix’s nucleotide bases. As such, he was unable to claim victory in the race to discover DNA’s true structure.\n\n(5). After several failed attempts at model building, including their ill-fated three-stranded model and one in which the bases were paired like-with-like (adenine with adenine, etc.), Watson and Crick achieved their breakthrough. Jerry Donohue, a visiting physical chemist from the United States who shared Watson and Crick's office for the year, pointed out that the configuration for the rings of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (the elements of all four bases) in thymine and guanine given in most textbooks of chemistry was incorrect. On February 28, 1953, Watson, acting on Donohue's advice, put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models. While shifting around the cardboard cut-outs of the accurate molecules on his office table, Watson realized in a stroke of inspiration that A, when joined with T, very nearly resembled a combination of C and G, and that each pair could hold together by forming hydrogen bonds. If A always paired with T, and likewise C with G, then not only were Chargaff's rules (that in DNA, the amount of A equals that of T, and C that of G) accounted for, but the pairs could be neatly fitted between the two helical sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA, the outside rails of the ladder. The bases connected to the two backbones at right angles while the backbones retained their regular shape as they wound around a common axis; similarly, the complementary pairing of the bases was compatible with the backbones, which ran in opposite directions to each other.\n\n(6). Watson and Crick published their findings in a one-page paper, with the understated title, \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,\" in the British scientific weekly, Nature, on April 25, 1953, illustrated with a schematic drawing of the double helix by Crick's wife, Odile. A coin toss decided the order in which they were named as authors. Foremost among the \"novel features\" of \"considerable biological interest\" they described was the pairing of the bases on the inside of the two DNA backbones: A=T and C=G. The pairing rule immediately suggested a copying mechanism for DNA: given the sequence of the bases in one strand, that of the other was automatically determined, which meant that when the two chains separated, each served as a template for a complementary new chain. Watson and Crick developed their ideas about genetic replication in the second article in Nature, published on May 30, 1953.\n\n(7). The two had shown that in DNA, form is function: the double-stranded molecule could both produce exact copies of itself and carry genetic instructions. During the following years, Crick elaborated on the implications of the double-helical model, advancing the hypothesis - revolutionary then but widely accepted since - that the sequence of the bases in DNA forms a code by which genetic information can be stored and transmitted. Although recognized today as one of the seminal scientific papers of the twentieth century, Watson and Crick's original article in Nature was not frequently cited at first; its true significance became apparent, and its circulation widened only towards the end of the 1950s. The structure of DNA they had proposed was shown to provide a mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, and when their conclusions were confirmed in the laboratory by Matthew Meselson, Crick himself immediately understood the significance of his and Watson's discovery. As Watson recalled, after their conceptual breakthrough on February 28, 1953, Crick declared to the assembled lunch patrons at The Eagle that they had \"found the secret of life.\" Crick himself had no memory of such an announcement but did recall telling his wife that evening \"that we seemed to have made a big discovery.\" Crick revealed that \"years later, she told me that she hadn't believed a word of it.\" He recounted that she said, \"You were always coming home and saying things like that, so naturally, I thought nothing of it.\"\n\n(8). Retrospective accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA have continued to elicit a measure of controversy. Crick was incensed at Watson's depiction of their collaboration in The Double Helix (1968), castigating the book as a betrayal of their friendship, an intrusion into Crick’s privacy, and a distortion of his (Crick’s) motives. Crick waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent its publication, but he eventually reconciled himself to the existence of Watson's bestseller, concluding that if it presented an unfavorable portrait of a scientist, it was of Watson, not of himself.\n\n(9). A more enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of Rosalind Franklin's crystallographic evidence of the structure of DNA, shown to them without her knowledge by her estranged colleagues. Franklin’s evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel. Franklin's superb experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery, yet they gave her scant acknowledgment; even so, Franklin bore no resentment towards them. She had presented her findings at a public seminar to which she had invited the two, and she soon left DNA research to study the tobacco mosaic virus. Franklin became friends with both Watson and Crick and spent her last period of remission from ovarian cancer in Crick's house. Crick believed that he and Watson used Franklin’s evidence appropriately while also admitting that their patronizing attitude towards Franklin, as depicted in The Double Helix, reflected contemporary conventions of gender in science.\n\n(10). Numerous examples show how Watson’s depiction of Rosalind Franklin in The Double Helix reflects mid-century attitudes towards women scientists. In addition to referring to Franklin in a scornful manner, Watson attempts to subvert the fact of her scientific prowess by focusing more on her personal character, which he portrays as cheerless and somewhat volatile, rather than emphasizing her workplace contributions. Although Franklin undoubtedly played an essential role in understanding the true structure of DNA, in his book Watson devalues her input in favor of his own and Crick’s, illustrating how the 1950s were a time in which women’s scholarly work was considered inherently less valuable than that of men. Importantly, Watson’s discriminatory depiction of Franklin in The Double Helix also highlights the crucial need for contemporary audiences to recognize how gender bias influences historical narratives, both scientific and otherwise."

Other researchers had made important but seemingly unconnected findings on the composition of DNA, but it fell to Watson and Crick to unify these disparate findings into a coherent theory of genetic transfer. The organic chemist Alexander Todd determined that the backbone of the DNA molecule contained repeating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups. The biochemist Erwin Chargaff found that, while the amount of DNA and its four types of bases—the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine (T)—varied widely from species to species, A and T always appeared in ratios of one-to-one, as did G and C. Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin had obtained high-resolution X-ray images of DNA fibers that suggested a helical, corkscrew-like shape. Linus Pauling, the world's leading physical chemist at the time, had recently discovered the single-stranded alpha helix, the structure found in many proteins, prompting biologists to think of helical forms. Moreover, he pioneered the method of model building in chemistry by which Watson and Crick were to eventually uncover the structure of DNA. Indeed, Crick and Watson feared that they would be upstaged by Pauling, who proposed his model of DNA in February 1953, although his three-stranded helical structure quickly proved erroneous.\n\n(4). Linus Pauling was unsuccessful in his endeavor to become the first individual to determine the true structure of DNA, owing to the fact that the model he introduced in 1953 was fraught with serious errors. Pauling presented a triple helix model, thus failing to adhere to the findings of chemist Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography images had previously provided insight into the two-stranded nature of DNA. Pauling also suggested that the helix’s negatively charged phosphate groups are found on its inside, while its bases are located on its outside. The opposite is actually true, with the phosphate groups located on the outside of the helix and the bases facing inward. Lastly, Pauling failed to fully consider the hydrogen bonding patterns between the helix’s nucleotide bases. As such, he was unable to claim victory in the race to discover DNA’s true structure.\n\n(5). After several failed attempts at model building, including their ill-fated three-stranded model and one in which the bases were paired like-with-like (adenine with adenine, etc.), Watson and Crick achieved their breakthrough. Jerry Donohue, a visiting physical chemist from the United States who shared Watson and Crick's office for the year, pointed out that the configuration for the rings of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (the elements of all four bases) in thymine and guanine given in most textbooks of chemistry was incorrect. On February 28, 1953, Watson, acting on Donohue's advice, put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models. While shifting around the cardboard cut-outs of the accurate molecules on his office table, Watson realized in a stroke of inspiration that A, when joined with T, very nearly resembled a combination of C and G, and that each pair could hold together by forming hydrogen bonds. If A always paired with T, and likewise C with G, then not only were Chargaff's rules (that in DNA, the amount of A equals that of T, and C that of G) accounted for, but the pairs could be neatly fitted between the two helical sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA, the outside rails of the ladder. The bases connected to the two backbones at right angles while the backbones retained their regular shape as they wound around a common axis; similarly, the complementary pairing of the bases was compatible with the backbones, which ran in opposite directions to each other.\n\n(6). Watson and Crick published their findings in a one-page paper, with the understated title, \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,\" in the British scientific weekly, Nature, on April 25, 1953, illustrated with a schematic drawing of the double helix by Crick's wife, Odile. A coin toss decided the order in which they were named as authors. Foremost among the \"novel features\" of \"considerable biological interest\" they described was the pairing of the bases on the inside of the two DNA backbones: A=T and C=G. The pairing rule immediately suggested a copying mechanism for DNA: given the sequence of the bases in one strand, that of the other was automatically determined, which meant that when the two chains separated, each served as a template for a complementary new chain. Watson and Crick developed their ideas about genetic replication in the second article in Nature, published on May 30, 1953.\n\n(7). The two had shown that in DNA, form is function: the double-stranded molecule could both produce exact copies of itself and carry genetic instructions. During the following years, Crick elaborated on the implications of the double-helical model, advancing the hypothesis - revolutionary then but widely accepted since - that the sequence of the bases in DNA forms a code by which genetic information can be stored and transmitted. Although recognized today as one of the seminal scientific papers of the twentieth century, Watson and Crick's original article in Nature was not frequently cited at first; its true significance became apparent, and its circulation widened only towards the end of the 1950s. The structure of DNA they had proposed was shown to provide a mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, and when their conclusions were confirmed in the laboratory by Matthew Meselson, Crick himself immediately understood the significance of his and Watson's discovery. As Watson recalled, after their conceptual breakthrough on February 28, 1953, Crick declared to the assembled lunch patrons at The Eagle that they had \"found the secret of life.\" Crick himself had no memory of such an announcement but did recall telling his wife that evening \"that we seemed to have made a big discovery.\" Crick revealed that \"years later, she told me that she hadn't believed a word of it.\" He recounted that she said, \"You were always coming home and saying things like that, so naturally, I thought nothing of it.\"\n\n(8). Retrospective accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA have continued to elicit a measure of controversy. Crick was incensed at Watson's depiction of their collaboration in The Double Helix (1968), castigating the book as a betrayal of their friendship, an intrusion into Crick’s privacy, and a distortion of his (Crick’s) motives. Crick waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent its publication, but he eventually reconciled himself to the existence of Watson's bestseller, concluding that if it presented an unfavorable portrait of a scientist, it was of Watson, not of himself.\n\n(9). A more enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of Rosalind Franklin's crystallographic evidence of the structure of DNA, shown to them without her knowledge by her estranged colleagues. Franklin’s evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel. Franklin's superb experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery, yet they gave her scant acknowledgment; even so, Franklin bore no resentment towards them. She had presented her findings at a public seminar to which she had invited the two, and she soon left DNA research to study the tobacco mosaic virus. Franklin became friends with both Watson and Crick and spent her last period of remission from ovarian cancer in Crick's house. Crick believed that he and Watson used Franklin’s evidence appropriately while also admitting that their patronizing attitude towards Franklin, as depicted in The Double Helix, reflected contemporary conventions of gender in science.\n\n(10). Numerous examples show how Watson’s depiction of Rosalind Franklin in The Double Helix reflects mid-century attitudes towards women scientists. In addition to referring to Franklin in a scornful manner, Watson attempts to subvert the fact of her scientific prowess by focusing more on her personal character, which he portrays as cheerless and somewhat volatile, rather than emphasizing her workplace contributions. Although Franklin undoubtedly played an essential role in understanding the true structure of DNA, in his book Watson devalues her input in favor of his own and Crick’s, illustrating how the 1950s were a time in which women’s scholarly work was considered inherently less valuable than that of men. Importantly, Watson’s discriminatory depiction of Franklin in The Double Helix also highlights the crucial need for contemporary audiences to recognize how gender bias influences historical narratives, both scientific and otherwise."

As this is the case, we can presume that “early scientists” refers to scientists who came before Watson and Crick. Paragraph 2 tells us that Watson and Crick began their work in the summer of 1951; thus, the scientists referred to as “early scientists” must have been working in a preceding year. We should therefore scan each paragraph that references scientists working before 1951 to determine if the beliefs of these scientists are being discussed. Paragraph 2 states: “In 1944 , Oswald Avery had shown that DNA was the “transforming principle,” the carrier of hereditary information, in pneumococcal bacteria. Nevertheless, most scientists continued to believe that DNA had a structure too uniform and simple to store genetic information for making complex living organisms. The genetic material, they reasoned, must consist of proteins: much more diverse and intricate molecules known to perform several biological functions in the cell.” All option choices are mentioned in the above paragraph except for Option D. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",

      "text": "(1). The discovery of the double helix, the twisted-ladder structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), by James Watson and Francis Crick, marked a milestone in the history of science and gave rise to modern molecular biology, which is mainly concerned with understanding how genes control the chemical processes within cells. In short order, Watson and Crick’s discovery yielded ground-breaking insights into the genetic code and protein synthesis. During the 1970s and 1980s, it helped produce new and powerful scientific techniques, specifically recombinant DNA research, genetic engineering, rapid gene sequencing, and monoclonal antibodies. These are techniques on which today's multi-billion-dollar biotechnology industry is founded. Current advances in science all have their origins in Watson and Crick's inspired work, namely genetic fingerprinting and modern forensics, the mapping of the human genome, and the promise - yet unfulfilled - of gene therapy. The double helix has not only reshaped biology but has become a cultural icon, represented in sculpture, visual art, jewelry, and toys.\n\n(2). Researchers working on DNA in the early 1950s used the term \"gene\" to mean the smallest unit of genetic information. At the time, it was unknown what a gene looked like structurally and chemically or how it was copied, with very few errors, generation after generation. In 1944, Oswald Avery had shown that DNA was the \"transforming principle,\" the carrier of hereditary information, in pneumococcal bacteria. Nevertheless, most scientists continued to believe that DNA had a structure too uniform and simple to store genetic information for making complex living organisms. The genetic material, they reasoned, must consist of proteins: much more diverse and intricate molecules known to perform several biological functions in the cell. Crick and Watson recognized at an early stage in their careers that gaining a detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional configuration of the gene was the central problem in molecular biology; heredity and reproduction could not be understood without such knowledge. Watson and Crick seized on this problem during their very first encounter in the summer of 1951 and pursued it with a single-minded focus over the next eighteen months. The problem at hand meant taking on the arduous intellectual task of immersing themselves in all the fields of science involved: genetics, biochemistry, chemistry, physical chemistry, and X-ray crystallography. Drawing on the experimental results of others, taking advantage of their complementary scientific backgrounds in physics and X-ray crystallography (Crick) and viral and bacterial genetics (Watson), and relying on their brilliant intuition, persistence, and luck, the two showed that DNA had a structure sufficiently complex and yet elegantly simple enough to be the master molecule of life.\n\n(3).

A coin toss decided the order in which they were named as authors. Foremost among the \"novel features\" of \"considerable biological interest\" they described was the pairing of the bases on the inside of the two DNA backbones: A=T and C=G. The pairing rule immediately suggested a copying mechanism for DNA: given the sequence of the bases in one strand, that of the other was automatically determined, which meant that when the two chains separated, each served as a template for a complementary new chain. Watson and Crick developed their ideas about genetic replication in the second article in Nature, published on May 30, 1953.\n\n(7). The two had shown that in DNA, form is function: the double-stranded molecule could both produce exact copies of itself and carry genetic instructions. During the following years, Crick elaborated on the implications of the double-helical model, advancing the hypothesis - revolutionary then but widely accepted since - that the sequence of the bases in DNA forms a code by which genetic information can be stored and transmitted. Although recognized today as one of the seminal scientific papers of the twentieth century, Watson and Crick's original article in Nature was not frequently cited at first; its true significance became apparent, and its circulation widened only towards the end of the 1950s. The structure of DNA they had proposed was shown to provide a mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, and when their conclusions were confirmed in the laboratory by Matthew Meselson, Crick himself immediately understood the significance of his and Watson's discovery. As Watson recalled, after their conceptual breakthrough on February 28, 1953, Crick declared to the assembled lunch patrons at The Eagle that they had \"found the secret of life.\" Crick himself had no memory of such an announcement but did recall telling his wife that evening \"that we seemed to have made a big discovery.\" Crick revealed that \"years later, she told me that she hadn't believed a word of it.\" He recounted that she said, \"You were always coming home and saying things like that, so naturally, I thought nothing of it.\"\n\n(8). Retrospective accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA have continued to elicit a measure of controversy. Crick was incensed at Watson's depiction of their collaboration in The Double Helix (1968), castigating the book as a betrayal of their friendship, an intrusion into Crick’s privacy, and a distortion of his (Crick’s) motives. Crick waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent its publication, but he eventually reconciled himself to the existence of Watson's bestseller, concluding that if it presented an unfavorable portrait of a scientist, it was of Watson, not of himself.\n\n(9). A more enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of Rosalind Franklin's crystallographic evidence of the structure of DNA, shown to them without her knowledge by her estranged colleagues. Franklin’s evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel. Franklin's superb experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery, yet they gave her scant acknowledgment; even so, Franklin bore no resentment towards them. She had presented her findings at a public seminar to which she had invited the two, and she soon left DNA research to study the tobacco mosaic virus. Franklin became friends with both Watson and Crick and spent her last period of remission from ovarian cancer in Crick's house. Crick believed that he and Watson used Franklin’s evidence appropriately while also admitting that their patronizing attitude towards Franklin, as depicted in The Double Helix, reflected contemporary conventions of gender in science.\n\n(10). Numerous examples show how Watson’s depiction of Rosalind Franklin in The Double Helix reflects mid-century attitudes towards women scientists. In addition to referring to Franklin in a scornful manner, Watson attempts to subvert the fact of her scientific prowess by focusing more on her personal character, which he portrays as cheerless and somewhat volatile, rather than emphasizing her workplace contributions. Although Franklin undoubtedly played an essential role in understanding the true structure of DNA, in his book Watson devalues her input in favor of his own and Crick’s, illustrating how the 1950s were a time in which women’s scholarly work was considered inherently less valuable than that of men. Importantly, Watson’s discriminatory depiction of Franklin in The Double Helix also highlights the crucial need for contemporary audiences to recognize how gender bias influences historical narratives, both scientific and otherwise."

      "text": "(1). The discovery of the double helix, the twisted-ladder structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), by James Watson and Francis Crick, marked a milestone in the history of science and gave rise to modern molecular biology, which is mainly concerned with understanding how genes control the chemical processes within cells. In short order, Watson and Crick’s discovery yielded ground-breaking insights into the genetic code and protein synthesis. During the 1970s and 1980s, it helped produce new and powerful scientific techniques, specifically recombinant DNA research, genetic engineering, rapid gene sequencing, and monoclonal antibodies. These are techniques on which today's multi-billion-dollar biotechnology industry is founded. Current advances in science all have their origins in Watson and Crick's inspired work, namely genetic fingerprinting and modern forensics, the mapping of the human genome, and the promise - yet unfulfilled - of gene therapy. The double helix has not only reshaped biology but has become a cultural icon, represented in sculpture, visual art, jewelry, and toys.\n\n(2). Researchers working on DNA in the early 1950s used the term \"gene\" to mean the smallest unit of genetic information. At the time, it was unknown what a gene looked like structurally and chemically or how it was copied, with very few errors, generation after generation. In 1944, Oswald Avery had shown that DNA was the \"transforming principle,\" the carrier of hereditary information, in pneumococcal bacteria. Nevertheless, most scientists continued to believe that DNA had a structure too uniform and simple to store genetic information for making complex living organisms. The genetic material, they reasoned, must consist of proteins: much more diverse and intricate molecules known to perform several biological functions in the cell. Crick and Watson recognized at an early stage in their careers that gaining a detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional configuration of the gene was the central problem in molecular biology; heredity and reproduction could not be understood without such knowledge. Watson and Crick seized on this problem during their very first encounter in the summer of 1951 and pursued it with a single-minded focus over the next eighteen months. The problem at hand meant taking on the arduous intellectual task of immersing themselves in all the fields of science involved: genetics, biochemistry, chemistry, physical chemistry, and X-ray crystallography. Drawing on the experimental results of others, taking advantage of their complementary scientific backgrounds in physics and X-ray crystallography (Crick) and viral and bacterial genetics (Watson), and relying on their brilliant intuition, persistence, and luck, the two showed that DNA had a structure sufficiently complex and yet elegantly simple enough to be the master molecule of life.\n\n(3). Other researchers had made important but seemingly unconnected findings on the composition of DNA, but it fell to Watson and Crick to unify these disparate findings into a coherent theory of genetic transfer. The organic chemist Alexander Todd determined that the backbone of the DNA molecule contained repeating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups. The biochemist Erwin Chargaff found that, while the amount of DNA and its four types of bases—the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine (T)—varied widely from species to species, A and T always appeared in ratios of one-to-one, as did G and C. Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin had obtained high-resolution X-ray images of DNA fibers that suggested a helical, corkscrew-like shape. Linus Pauling, the world's leading physical chemist at the time, had recently discovered the single-stranded alpha helix, the structure found in many proteins, prompting biologists to think of helical forms. Moreover, he pioneered the method of model building in chemistry by which Watson and Crick were to eventually uncover the structure of DNA. Indeed, Crick and Watson feared that they would be upstaged by Pauling, who proposed his model of DNA in February 1953, although his three-stranded helical structure quickly proved erroneous.\n\n(4). Linus Pauling was unsuccessful in his endeavor to become the first individual to determine the true structure of DNA, owing to the fact that the model he introduced in 1953 was fraught with serious errors. Pauling presented a triple helix model, thus failing to adhere to the findings of chemist Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography images had previously provided insight into the two-stranded nature of DNA. Pauling also suggested that the helix’s negatively charged phosphate groups are found on its inside, while its bases are located on its outside. The opposite is actually true, with the phosphate groups located on the outside of the helix and the bases facing inward. Lastly, Pauling failed to fully consider the hydrogen bonding patterns between the helix’s nucleotide bases. As such, he was unable to claim victory in the race to discover DNA’s true structure.\n\n(5). After several failed attempts at model building, including their ill-fated three-stranded model and one in which the bases were paired like-with-like (adenine with adenine, etc.), Watson and Crick achieved their breakthrough. Jerry Donohue, a visiting physical chemist from the United States who shared Watson and Crick's office for the year, pointed out that the configuration for the rings of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (the elements of all four bases) in thymine and guanine given in most textbooks of chemistry was incorrect. On February 28, 1953, Watson, acting on Donohue's advice, put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models. While shifting around the cardboard cut-outs of the accurate molecules on his office table, Watson realized in a stroke of inspiration that A, when joined with T, very nearly resembled a combination of C and G, and that each pair could hold together by forming hydrogen bonds. If A always paired with T, and likewise C with G, then not only were Chargaff's rules (that in DNA, the amount of A equals that of T, and C that of G) accounted for, but the pairs could be neatly fitted between the two helical sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA, the outside rails of the ladder. The bases connected to the two backbones at right angles while the backbones retained their regular shape as they wound around a common axis; similarly, the complementary pairing of the bases was compatible with the backbones, which ran in opposite directions to each other.\n\n(6).

Numerous examples show how Watson’s depiction of Rosalind Franklin in The Double Helix reflects mid-century attitudes towards women scientists. In addition to referring to Franklin in a scornful manner, Watson attempts to subvert the fact of her scientific prowess by focusing more on her personal character, which he portrays as cheerless and somewhat volatile, rather than emphasizing her workplace contributions. Although Franklin undoubtedly played an essential role in understanding the true structure of DNA, in his book Watson devalues her input in favor of his own and Crick’s, illustrating how the 1950s were a time in which women’s scholarly work was considered inherently less valuable than that of men. Importantly, Watson’s discriminatory depiction of Franklin in The Double Helix also highlights the crucial need for contemporary audiences to recognize how gender bias influences historical narratives, both scientific and otherwise."

      "text": "(1). The discovery of the double helix, the twisted-ladder structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), by James Watson and Francis Crick, marked a milestone in the history of science and gave rise to modern molecular biology, which is mainly concerned with understanding how genes control the chemical processes within cells. In short order, Watson and Crick’s discovery yielded ground-breaking insights into the genetic code and protein synthesis. During the 1970s and 1980s, it helped produce new and powerful scientific techniques, specifically recombinant DNA research, genetic engineering, rapid gene sequencing, and monoclonal antibodies. These are techniques on which today's multi-billion-dollar biotechnology industry is founded. Current advances in science all have their origins in Watson and Crick's inspired work, namely genetic fingerprinting and modern forensics, the mapping of the human genome, and the promise - yet unfulfilled - of gene therapy. The double helix has not only reshaped biology but has become a cultural icon, represented in sculpture, visual art, jewelry, and toys.\n\n(2). Researchers working on DNA in the early 1950s used the term \"gene\" to mean the smallest unit of genetic information. At the time, it was unknown what a gene looked like structurally and chemically or how it was copied, with very few errors, generation after generation. In 1944, Oswald Avery had shown that DNA was the \"transforming principle,\" the carrier of hereditary information, in pneumococcal bacteria. Nevertheless, most scientists continued to believe that DNA had a structure too uniform and simple to store genetic information for making complex living organisms. The genetic material, they reasoned, must consist of proteins: much more diverse and intricate molecules known to perform several biological functions in the cell. Crick and Watson recognized at an early stage in their careers that gaining a detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional configuration of the gene was the central problem in molecular biology; heredity and reproduction could not be understood without such knowledge. Watson and Crick seized on this problem during their very first encounter in the summer of 1951 and pursued it with a single-minded focus over the next eighteen months. The problem at hand meant taking on the arduous intellectual task of immersing themselves in all the fields of science involved: genetics, biochemistry, chemistry, physical chemistry, and X-ray crystallography. Drawing on the experimental results of others, taking advantage of their complementary scientific backgrounds in physics and X-ray crystallography (Crick) and viral and bacterial genetics (Watson), and relying on their brilliant intuition, persistence, and luck, the two showed that DNA had a structure sufficiently complex and yet elegantly simple enough to be the master molecule of life.\n\n(3). Other researchers had made important but seemingly unconnected findings on the composition of DNA, but it fell to Watson and Crick to unify these disparate findings into a coherent theory of genetic transfer. The organic chemist Alexander Todd determined that the backbone of the DNA molecule contained repeating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups. The biochemist Erwin Chargaff found that, while the amount of DNA and its four types of bases—the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine (T)—varied widely from species to species, A and T always appeared in ratios of one-to-one, as did G and C. Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin had obtained high-resolution X-ray images of DNA fibers that suggested a helical, corkscrew-like shape. Linus Pauling, the world's leading physical chemist at the time, had recently discovered the single-stranded alpha helix, the structure found in many proteins, prompting biologists to think of helical forms. Moreover, he pioneered the method of model building in chemistry by which Watson and Crick were to eventually uncover the structure of DNA. Indeed, Crick and Watson feared that they would be upstaged by Pauling, who proposed his model of DNA in February 1953, although his three-stranded helical structure quickly proved erroneous.\n\n(4). Linus Pauling was unsuccessful in his endeavor to become the first individual to determine the true structure of DNA, owing to the fact that the model he introduced in 1953 was fraught with serious errors. Pauling presented a triple helix model, thus failing to adhere to the findings of chemist Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography images had previously provided insight into the two-stranded nature of DNA. Pauling also suggested that the helix’s negatively charged phosphate groups are found on its inside, while its bases are located on its outside. The opposite is actually true, with the phosphate groups located on the outside of the helix and the bases facing inward. Lastly, Pauling failed to fully consider the hydrogen bonding patterns between the helix’s nucleotide bases. As such, he was unable to claim victory in the race to discover DNA’s true structure.\n\n(5). After several failed attempts at model building, including their ill-fated three-stranded model and one in which the bases were paired like-with-like (adenine with adenine, etc.), Watson and Crick achieved their breakthrough. Jerry Donohue, a visiting physical chemist from the United States who shared Watson and Crick's office for the year, pointed out that the configuration for the rings of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (the elements of all four bases) in thymine and guanine given in most textbooks of chemistry was incorrect. On February 28, 1953, Watson, acting on Donohue's advice, put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models. While shifting around the cardboard cut-outs of the accurate molecules on his office table, Watson realized in a stroke of inspiration that A, when joined with T, very nearly resembled a combination of C and G, and that each pair could hold together by forming hydrogen bonds. If A always paired with T, and likewise C with G, then not only were Chargaff's rules (that in DNA, the amount of A equals that of T, and C that of G) accounted for, but the pairs could be neatly fitted between the two helical sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA, the outside rails of the ladder. The bases connected to the two backbones at right angles while the backbones retained their regular shape as they wound around a common axis; similarly, the complementary pairing of the bases was compatible with the backbones, which ran in opposite directions to each other.\n\n(6). Watson and Crick published their findings in a one-page paper, with the understated title, \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,\" in the British scientific weekly, Nature, on April 25, 1953, illustrated with a schematic drawing of the double helix by Crick's wife, Odile. A coin toss decided the order in which they were named as authors. Foremost among the \"novel features\" of \"considerable biological interest\" they described was the pairing of the bases on the inside of the two DNA backbones: A=T and C=G. The pairing rule immediately suggested a copying mechanism for DNA: given the sequence of the bases in one strand, that of the other was automatically determined, which meant that when the two chains separated, each served as a template for a complementary new chain. Watson and Crick developed their ideas about genetic replication in the second article in Nature, published on May 30, 1953.\n\n(7). The two had shown that in DNA, form is function: the double-stranded molecule could both produce exact copies of itself and carry genetic instructions. During the following years, Crick elaborated on the implications of the double-helical model, advancing the hypothesis - revolutionary then but widely accepted since - that the sequence of the bases in DNA forms a code by which genetic information can be stored and transmitted. Although recognized today as one of the seminal scientific papers of the twentieth century, Watson and Crick's original article in Nature was not frequently cited at first; its true significance became apparent, and its circulation widened only towards the end of the 1950s. The structure of DNA they had proposed was shown to provide a mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, and when their conclusions were confirmed in the laboratory by Matthew Meselson, Crick himself immediately understood the significance of his and Watson's discovery. As Watson recalled, after their conceptual breakthrough on February 28, 1953, Crick declared to the assembled lunch patrons at The Eagle that they had \"found the secret of life.\" Crick himself had no memory of such an announcement but did recall telling his wife that evening \"that we seemed to have made a big discovery.\" Crick revealed that \"years later, she told me that she hadn't believed a word of it.\" He recounted that she said, \"You were always coming home and saying things like that, so naturally, I thought nothing of it.\"\n\n(8). Retrospective accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA have continued to elicit a measure of controversy. Crick was incensed at Watson's depiction of their collaboration in The Double Helix (1968), castigating the book as a betrayal of their friendship, an intrusion into Crick’s privacy, and a distortion of his (Crick’s) motives. Crick waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent its publication, but he eventually reconciled himself to the existence of Watson's bestseller, concluding that if it presented an unfavorable portrait of a scientist, it was of Watson, not of himself.\n\n(9). A more enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of Rosalind Franklin's crystallographic evidence of the structure of DNA, shown to them without her knowledge by her estranged colleagues. Franklin’s evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel. Franklin's superb experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery, yet they gave her scant acknowledgment; even so, Franklin bore no resentment towards them. She had presented her findings at a public seminar to which she had invited the two, and she soon left DNA research to study the tobacco mosaic virus. Franklin became friends with both Watson and Crick and spent her last period of remission from ovarian cancer in Crick's house. Crick believed that he and Watson used Franklin’s evidence appropriately while also admitting that their patronizing attitude towards Franklin, as depicted in The Double Helix, reflected contemporary conventions of gender in science.\n\n(10). Numerous examples show how Watson’s depiction of Rosalind Franklin in The Double Helix reflects mid-century attitudes towards women scientists. In addition to referring to Franklin in a scornful manner, Watson attempts to subvert the fact of her scientific prowess by focusing more on her personal character, which he portrays as cheerless and somewhat volatile, rather than emphasizing her workplace contributions. Although Franklin undoubtedly played an essential role in understanding the true structure of DNA, in his book Watson devalues her input in favor of his own and Crick’s, illustrating how the 1950s were a time in which women’s scholarly work was considered inherently less valuable than that of men. Importantly, Watson’s discriminatory depiction of Franklin in The Double Helix also highlights the crucial need for contemporary audiences to recognize how gender bias influences historical narratives, both scientific and otherwise."

In short order, Watson and Crick’s discovery yielded ground-breaking insights into the genetic code and protein synthesis. During the 1970s and 1980s, it helped produce new and powerful scientific techniques, specifically recombinant DNA research, genetic engineering, rapid gene sequencing, and monoclonal antibodies. These are techniques on which today's multi-billion-dollar biotechnology industry is founded. Current advances in science all have their origins in Watson and Crick's inspired work, namely genetic fingerprinting and modern forensics, the mapping of the human genome, and the promise - yet unfulfilled - of gene therapy. The double helix has not only reshaped biology but has become a cultural icon, represented in sculpture, visual art, jewelry, and toys.\n\n(2). Researchers working on DNA in the early 1950s used the term \"gene\" to mean the smallest unit of genetic information. At the time, it was unknown what a gene looked like structurally and chemically or how it was copied, with very few errors, generation after generation. In 1944, Oswald Avery had shown that DNA was the \"transforming principle,\" the carrier of hereditary information, in pneumococcal bacteria. Nevertheless, most scientists continued to believe that DNA had a structure too uniform and simple to store genetic information for making complex living organisms. The genetic material, they reasoned, must consist of proteins: much more diverse and intricate molecules known to perform several biological functions in the cell. Crick and Watson recognized at an early stage in their careers that gaining a detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional configuration of the gene was the central problem in molecular biology; heredity and reproduction could not be understood without such knowledge. Watson and Crick seized on this problem during their very first encounter in the summer of 1951 and pursued it with a single-minded focus over the next eighteen months. The problem at hand meant taking on the arduous intellectual task of immersing themselves in all the fields of science involved: genetics, biochemistry, chemistry, physical chemistry, and X-ray crystallography. Drawing on the experimental results of others, taking advantage of their complementary scientific backgrounds in physics and X-ray crystallography (Crick) and viral and bacterial genetics (Watson), and relying on their brilliant intuition, persistence, and luck, the two showed that DNA had a structure sufficiently complex and yet elegantly simple enough to be the master molecule of life.\n\n(3). Other researchers had made important but seemingly unconnected findings on the composition of DNA, but it fell to Watson and Crick to unify these disparate findings into a coherent theory of genetic transfer. The organic chemist Alexander Todd determined that the backbone of the DNA molecule contained repeating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups. The biochemist Erwin Chargaff found that, while the amount of DNA and its four types of bases—the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine (T)—varied widely from species to species, A and T always appeared in ratios of one-to-one, as did G and C. Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin had obtained high-resolution X-ray images of DNA fibers that suggested a helical, corkscrew-like shape. Linus Pauling, the world's leading physical chemist at the time, had recently discovered the single-stranded alpha helix, the structure found in many proteins, prompting biologists to think of helical forms. Moreover, he pioneered the method of model building in chemistry by which Watson and Crick were to eventually uncover the structure of DNA. Indeed, Crick and Watson feared that they would be upstaged by Pauling, who proposed his model of DNA in February 1953, although his three-stranded helical structure quickly proved erroneous.\n\n(4). Linus Pauling was unsuccessful in his endeavor to become the first individual to determine the true structure of DNA, owing to the fact that the model he introduced in 1953 was fraught with serious errors. Pauling presented a triple helix model, thus failing to adhere to the findings of chemist Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography images had previously provided insight into the two-stranded nature of DNA. Pauling also suggested that the helix’s negatively charged phosphate groups are found on its inside, while its bases are located on its outside. The opposite is actually true, with the phosphate groups located on the outside of the helix and the bases facing inward. Lastly, Pauling failed to fully consider the hydrogen bonding patterns between the helix’s nucleotide bases. As such, he was unable to claim victory in the race to discover DNA’s true structure.\n\n(5). After several failed attempts at model building, including their ill-fated three-stranded model and one in which the bases were paired like-with-like (adenine with adenine, etc.), Watson and Crick achieved their breakthrough. Jerry Donohue, a visiting physical chemist from the United States who shared Watson and Crick's office for the year, pointed out that the configuration for the rings of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (the elements of all four bases) in thymine and guanine given in most textbooks of chemistry was incorrect. On February 28, 1953, Watson, acting on Donohue's advice, put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models. While shifting around the cardboard cut-outs of the accurate molecules on his office table, Watson realized in a stroke of inspiration that A, when joined with T, very nearly resembled a combination of C and G, and that each pair could hold together by forming hydrogen bonds. If A always paired with T, and likewise C with G, then not only were Chargaff's rules (that in DNA, the amount of A equals that of T, and C that of G) accounted for, but the pairs could be neatly fitted between the two helical sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA, the outside rails of the ladder. The bases connected to the two backbones at right angles while the backbones retained their regular shape as they wound around a common axis; similarly, the complementary pairing of the bases was compatible with the backbones, which ran in opposite directions to each other.\n\n(6). Watson and Crick published their findings in a one-page paper, with the understated title, \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,\" in the British scientific weekly, Nature, on April 25, 1953, illustrated with a schematic drawing of the double helix by Crick's wife, Odile. A coin toss decided the order in which they were named as authors. Foremost among the \"novel features\" of \"considerable biological interest\" they described was the pairing of the bases on the inside of the two DNA backbones: A=T and C=G. The pairing rule immediately suggested a copying mechanism for DNA: given the sequence of the bases in one strand, that of the other was automatically determined, which meant that when the two chains separated, each served as a template for a complementary new chain. Watson and Crick developed their ideas about genetic replication in the second article in Nature, published on May 30, 1953.\n\n(7). The two had shown that in DNA, form is function: the double-stranded molecule could both produce exact copies of itself and carry genetic instructions. During the following years, Crick elaborated on the implications of the double-helical model, advancing the hypothesis - revolutionary then but widely accepted since - that the sequence of the bases in DNA forms a code by which genetic information can be stored and transmitted. Although recognized today as one of the seminal scientific papers of the twentieth century, Watson and Crick's original article in Nature was not frequently cited at first; its true significance became apparent, and its circulation widened only towards the end of the 1950s. The structure of DNA they had proposed was shown to provide a mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, and when their conclusions were confirmed in the laboratory by Matthew Meselson, Crick himself immediately understood the significance of his and Watson's discovery. As Watson recalled, after their conceptual breakthrough on February 28, 1953, Crick declared to the assembled lunch patrons at The Eagle that they had \"found the secret of life.\" Crick himself had no memory of such an announcement but did recall telling his wife that evening \"that we seemed to have made a big discovery.\" Crick revealed that \"years later, she told me that she hadn't believed a word of it.\" He recounted that she said, \"You were always coming home and saying things like that, so naturally, I thought nothing of it.\"\n\n(8). Retrospective accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA have continued to elicit a measure of controversy. Crick was incensed at Watson's depiction of their collaboration in The Double Helix (1968), castigating the book as a betrayal of their friendship, an intrusion into Crick’s privacy, and a distortion of his (Crick’s) motives. Crick waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent its publication, but he eventually reconciled himself to the existence of Watson's bestseller, concluding that if it presented an unfavorable portrait of a scientist, it was of Watson, not of himself.\n\n(9). A more enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of Rosalind Franklin's crystallographic evidence of the structure of DNA, shown to them without her knowledge by her estranged colleagues. Franklin’s evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel. Franklin's superb experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery, yet they gave her scant acknowledgment; even so, Franklin bore no resentment towards them. She had presented her findings at a public seminar to which she had invited the two, and she soon left DNA research to study the tobacco mosaic virus. Franklin became friends with both Watson and Crick and spent her last period of remission from ovarian cancer in Crick's house. Crick believed that he and Watson used Franklin’s evidence appropriately while also admitting that their patronizing attitude towards Franklin, as depicted in The Double Helix, reflected contemporary conventions of gender in science.\n\n(10). Numerous examples show how Watson’s depiction of Rosalind Franklin in The Double Helix reflects mid-century attitudes towards women scientists. In addition to referring to Franklin in a scornful manner, Watson attempts to subvert the fact of her scientific prowess by focusing more on her personal character, which he portrays as cheerless and somewhat volatile, rather than emphasizing her workplace contributions. Although Franklin undoubtedly played an essential role in understanding the true structure of DNA, in his book Watson devalues her input in favor of his own and Crick’s, illustrating how the 1950s were a time in which women’s scholarly work was considered inherently less valuable than that of men. Importantly, Watson’s discriminatory depiction of Franklin in The Double Helix also highlights the crucial need for contemporary audiences to recognize how gender bias influences historical narratives, both scientific and otherwise."

Pauling also suggested that the helix’s negatively charged phosphate groups are found on its inside, while its bases are located on its outside. The opposite is actually true, with the phosphate groups located on the outside of the helix and the bases facing inward. Lastly, Pauling failed to fully consider the hydrogen bonding patterns between the helix’s nucleotide bases. As such, he was unable to claim victory in the race to discover DNA’s true structure.\n\n(5). After several failed attempts at model building, including their ill-fated three-stranded model and one in which the bases were paired like-with-like (adenine with adenine, etc.), Watson and Crick achieved their breakthrough. Jerry Donohue, a visiting physical chemist from the United States who shared Watson and Crick's office for the year, pointed out that the configuration for the rings of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (the elements of all four bases) in thymine and guanine given in most textbooks of chemistry was incorrect. On February 28, 1953, Watson, acting on Donohue's advice, put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models. While shifting around the cardboard cut-outs of the accurate molecules on his office table, Watson realized in a stroke of inspiration that A, when joined with T, very nearly resembled a combination of C and G, and that each pair could hold together by forming hydrogen bonds. If A always paired with T, and likewise C with G, then not only were Chargaff's rules (that in DNA, the amount of A equals that of T, and C that of G) accounted for, but the pairs could be neatly fitted between the two helical sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA, the outside rails of the ladder. The bases connected to the two backbones at right angles while the backbones retained their regular shape as they wound around a common axis; similarly, the complementary pairing of the bases was compatible with the backbones, which ran in opposite directions to each other.\n\n(6). Watson and Crick published their findings in a one-page paper, with the understated title, \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,\" in the British scientific weekly, Nature, on April 25, 1953, illustrated with a schematic drawing of the double helix by Crick's wife, Odile. A coin toss decided the order in which they were named as authors. Foremost among the \"novel features\" of \"considerable biological interest\" they described was the pairing of the bases on the inside of the two DNA backbones: A=T and C=G. The pairing rule immediately suggested a copying mechanism for DNA: given the sequence of the bases in one strand, that of the other was automatically determined, which meant that when the two chains separated, each served as a template for a complementary new chain. Watson and Crick developed their ideas about genetic replication in the second article in Nature, published on May 30, 1953.\n\n(7). The two had shown that in DNA, form is function: the double-stranded molecule could both produce exact copies of itself and carry genetic instructions. During the following years, Crick elaborated on the implications of the double-helical model, advancing the hypothesis - revolutionary then but widely accepted since - that the sequence of the bases in DNA forms a code by which genetic information can be stored and transmitted. Although recognized today as one of the seminal scientific papers of the twentieth century, Watson and Crick's original article in Nature was not frequently cited at first; its true significance became apparent, and its circulation widened only towards the end of the 1950s. The structure of DNA they had proposed was shown to provide a mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, and when their conclusions were confirmed in the laboratory by Matthew Meselson, Crick himself immediately understood the significance of his and Watson's discovery. As Watson recalled, after their conceptual breakthrough on February 28, 1953, Crick declared to the assembled lunch patrons at The Eagle that they had \"found the secret of life.\" Crick himself had no memory of such an announcement but did recall telling his wife that evening \"that we seemed to have made a big discovery.\" Crick revealed that \"years later, she told me that she hadn't believed a word of it.\" He recounted that she said, \"You were always coming home and saying things like that, so naturally, I thought nothing of it.\"\n\n(8). Retrospective accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA have continued to elicit a measure of controversy. Crick was incensed at Watson's depiction of their collaboration in The Double Helix (1968), castigating the book as a betrayal of their friendship, an intrusion into Crick’s privacy, and a distortion of his (Crick’s) motives. Crick waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent its publication, but he eventually reconciled himself to the existence of Watson's bestseller, concluding that if it presented an unfavorable portrait of a scientist, it was of Watson, not of himself.\n\n(9). A more enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of Rosalind Franklin's crystallographic evidence of the structure of DNA, shown to them without her knowledge by her estranged colleagues. Franklin’s evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel. Franklin's superb experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery, yet they gave her scant acknowledgment; even so, Franklin bore no resentment towards them. She had presented her findings at a public seminar to which she had invited the two, and she soon left DNA research to study the tobacco mosaic virus. Franklin became friends with both Watson and Crick and spent her last period of remission from ovarian cancer in Crick's house. Crick believed that he and Watson used Franklin’s evidence appropriately while also admitting that their patronizing attitude towards Franklin, as depicted in The Double Helix, reflected contemporary conventions of gender in science.\n\n(10). Numerous examples show how Watson’s depiction of Rosalind Franklin in The Double Helix reflects mid-century attitudes towards women scientists. In addition to referring to Franklin in a scornful manner, Watson attempts to subvert the fact of her scientific prowess by focusing more on her personal character, which he portrays as cheerless and somewhat volatile, rather than emphasizing her workplace contributions. Although Franklin undoubtedly played an essential role in understanding the true structure of DNA, in his book Watson devalues her input in favor of his own and Crick’s, illustrating how the 1950s were a time in which women’s scholarly work was considered inherently less valuable than that of men. Importantly, Watson’s discriminatory depiction of Franklin in The Double Helix also highlights the crucial need for contemporary audiences to recognize how gender bias influences historical narratives, both scientific and otherwise."

      "text": "(1). The discovery of the double helix, the twisted-ladder structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), by James Watson and Francis Crick, marked a milestone in the history of science and gave rise to modern molecular biology, which is mainly concerned with understanding how genes control the chemical processes within cells. In short order, Watson and Crick’s discovery yielded ground-breaking insights into the genetic code and protein synthesis. During the 1970s and 1980s, it helped produce new and powerful scientific techniques, specifically recombinant DNA research, genetic engineering, rapid gene sequencing, and monoclonal antibodies. These are techniques on which today's multi-billion-dollar biotechnology industry is founded. Current advances in science all have their origins in Watson and Crick's inspired work, namely genetic fingerprinting and modern forensics, the mapping of the human genome, and the promise - yet unfulfilled - of gene therapy. The double helix has not only reshaped biology but has become a cultural icon, represented in sculpture, visual art, jewelry, and toys.\n\n(2). Researchers working on DNA in the early 1950s used the term \"gene\" to mean the smallest unit of genetic information. At the time, it was unknown what a gene looked like structurally and chemically or how it was copied, with very few errors, generation after generation. In 1944, Oswald Avery had shown that DNA was the \"transforming principle,\" the carrier of hereditary information, in pneumococcal bacteria. Nevertheless, most scientists continued to believe that DNA had a structure too uniform and simple to store genetic information for making complex living organisms. The genetic material, they reasoned, must consist of proteins: much more diverse and intricate molecules known to perform several biological functions in the cell. Crick and Watson recognized at an early stage in their careers that gaining a detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional configuration of the gene was the central problem in molecular biology; heredity and reproduction could not be understood without such knowledge. Watson and Crick seized on this problem during their very first encounter in the summer of 1951 and pursued it with a single-minded focus over the next eighteen months. The problem at hand meant taking on the arduous intellectual task of immersing themselves in all the fields of science involved: genetics, biochemistry, chemistry, physical chemistry, and X-ray crystallography. Drawing on the experimental results of others, taking advantage of their complementary scientific backgrounds in physics and X-ray crystallography (Crick) and viral and bacterial genetics (Watson), and relying on their brilliant intuition, persistence, and luck, the two showed that DNA had a structure sufficiently complex and yet elegantly simple enough to be the master molecule of life.\n\n(3). Other researchers had made important but seemingly unconnected findings on the composition of DNA, but it fell to Watson and Crick to unify these disparate findings into a coherent theory of genetic transfer. The organic chemist Alexander Todd determined that the backbone of the DNA molecule contained repeating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups. The biochemist Erwin Chargaff found that, while the amount of DNA and its four types of bases—the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine (T)—varied widely from species to species, A and T always appeared in ratios of one-to-one, as did G and C. Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin had obtained high-resolution X-ray images of DNA fibers that suggested a helical, corkscrew-like shape. Linus Pauling, the world's leading physical chemist at the time, had recently discovered the single-stranded alpha helix, the structure found in many proteins, prompting biologists to think of helical forms. Moreover, he pioneered the method of model building in chemistry by which Watson and Crick were to eventually uncover the structure of DNA. Indeed, Crick and Watson feared that they would be upstaged by Pauling, who proposed his model of DNA in February 1953, although his three-stranded helical structure quickly proved erroneous.\n\n(4). Linus Pauling was unsuccessful in his endeavor to become the first individual to determine the true structure of DNA, owing to the fact that the model he introduced in 1953 was fraught with serious errors.

As Watson recalled, after their conceptual breakthrough on February 28, 1953, Crick declared to the assembled lunch patrons at The Eagle that they had \"found the secret of life.\" Crick himself had no memory of such an announcement but did recall telling his wife that evening \"that we seemed to have made a big discovery.\" Crick revealed that \"years later, she told me that she hadn't believed a word of it.\" He recounted that she said, \"You were always coming home and saying things like that, so naturally, I thought nothing of it.\"\n\n(8). Retrospective accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA have continued to elicit a measure of controversy. Crick was incensed at Watson's depiction of their collaboration in The Double Helix (1968), castigating the book as a betrayal of their friendship, an intrusion into Crick’s privacy, and a distortion of his (Crick’s) motives. Crick waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent its publication, but he eventually reconciled himself to the existence of Watson's bestseller, concluding that if it presented an unfavorable portrait of a scientist, it was of Watson, not of himself.\n\n(9). A more enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of Rosalind Franklin's crystallographic evidence of the structure of DNA, shown to them without her knowledge by her estranged colleagues. Franklin’s evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel. Franklin's superb experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery, yet they gave her scant acknowledgment; even so, Franklin bore no resentment towards them. She had presented her findings at a public seminar to which she had invited the two, and she soon left DNA research to study the tobacco mosaic virus. Franklin became friends with both Watson and Crick and spent her last period of remission from ovarian cancer in Crick's house. Crick believed that he and Watson used Franklin’s evidence appropriately while also admitting that their patronizing attitude towards Franklin, as depicted in The Double Helix, reflected contemporary conventions of gender in science.\n\n(10). Numerous examples show how Watson’s depiction of Rosalind Franklin in The Double Helix reflects mid-century attitudes towards women scientists. In addition to referring to Franklin in a scornful manner, Watson attempts to subvert the fact of her scientific prowess by focusing more on her personal character, which he portrays as cheerless and somewhat volatile, rather than emphasizing her workplace contributions. Although Franklin undoubtedly played an essential role in understanding the true structure of DNA, in his book Watson devalues her input in favor of his own and Crick’s, illustrating how the 1950s were a time in which women’s scholarly work was considered inherently less valuable than that of men. Importantly, Watson’s discriminatory depiction of Franklin in The Double Helix also highlights the crucial need for contemporary audiences to recognize how gender bias influences historical narratives, both scientific and otherwise."

      "text": "(1). The discovery of the double helix, the twisted-ladder structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), by James Watson and Francis Crick, marked a milestone in the history of science and gave rise to modern molecular biology, which is mainly concerned with understanding how genes control the chemical processes within cells. In short order, Watson and Crick’s discovery yielded ground-breaking insights into the genetic code and protein synthesis. During the 1970s and 1980s, it helped produce new and powerful scientific techniques, specifically recombinant DNA research, genetic engineering, rapid gene sequencing, and monoclonal antibodies. These are techniques on which today's multi-billion-dollar biotechnology industry is founded. Current advances in science all have their origins in Watson and Crick's inspired work, namely genetic fingerprinting and modern forensics, the mapping of the human genome, and the promise - yet unfulfilled - of gene therapy. The double helix has not only reshaped biology but has become a cultural icon, represented in sculpture, visual art, jewelry, and toys.\n\n(2). Researchers working on DNA in the early 1950s used the term \"gene\" to mean the smallest unit of genetic information. At the time, it was unknown what a gene looked like structurally and chemically or how it was copied, with very few errors, generation after generation. In 1944, Oswald Avery had shown that DNA was the \"transforming principle,\" the carrier of hereditary information, in pneumococcal bacteria. Nevertheless, most scientists continued to believe that DNA had a structure too uniform and simple to store genetic information for making complex living organisms. The genetic material, they reasoned, must consist of proteins: much more diverse and intricate molecules known to perform several biological functions in the cell. Crick and Watson recognized at an early stage in their careers that gaining a detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional configuration of the gene was the central problem in molecular biology; heredity and reproduction could not be understood without such knowledge. Watson and Crick seized on this problem during their very first encounter in the summer of 1951 and pursued it with a single-minded focus over the next eighteen months. The problem at hand meant taking on the arduous intellectual task of immersing themselves in all the fields of science involved: genetics, biochemistry, chemistry, physical chemistry, and X-ray crystallography. Drawing on the experimental results of others, taking advantage of their complementary scientific backgrounds in physics and X-ray crystallography (Crick) and viral and bacterial genetics (Watson), and relying on their brilliant intuition, persistence, and luck, the two showed that DNA had a structure sufficiently complex and yet elegantly simple enough to be the master molecule of life.\n\n(3). Other researchers had made important but seemingly unconnected findings on the composition of DNA, but it fell to Watson and Crick to unify these disparate findings into a coherent theory of genetic transfer. The organic chemist Alexander Todd determined that the backbone of the DNA molecule contained repeating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups. The biochemist Erwin Chargaff found that, while the amount of DNA and its four types of bases—the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine (T)—varied widely from species to species, A and T always appeared in ratios of one-to-one, as did G and C. Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin had obtained high-resolution X-ray images of DNA fibers that suggested a helical, corkscrew-like shape. Linus Pauling, the world's leading physical chemist at the time, had recently discovered the single-stranded alpha helix, the structure found in many proteins, prompting biologists to think of helical forms. Moreover, he pioneered the method of model building in chemistry by which Watson and Crick were to eventually uncover the structure of DNA. Indeed, Crick and Watson feared that they would be upstaged by Pauling, who proposed his model of DNA in February 1953, although his three-stranded helical structure quickly proved erroneous.\n\n(4). Linus Pauling was unsuccessful in his endeavor to become the first individual to determine the true structure of DNA, owing to the fact that the model he introduced in 1953 was fraught with serious errors. Pauling presented a triple helix model, thus failing to adhere to the findings of chemist Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography images had previously provided insight into the two-stranded nature of DNA. Pauling also suggested that the helix’s negatively charged phosphate groups are found on its inside, while its bases are located on its outside. The opposite is actually true, with the phosphate groups located on the outside of the helix and the bases facing inward. Lastly, Pauling failed to fully consider the hydrogen bonding patterns between the helix’s nucleotide bases. As such, he was unable to claim victory in the race to discover DNA’s true structure.\n\n(5). After several failed attempts at model building, including their ill-fated three-stranded model and one in which the bases were paired like-with-like (adenine with adenine, etc.), Watson and Crick achieved their breakthrough. Jerry Donohue, a visiting physical chemist from the United States who shared Watson and Crick's office for the year, pointed out that the configuration for the rings of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (the elements of all four bases) in thymine and guanine given in most textbooks of chemistry was incorrect. On February 28, 1953, Watson, acting on Donohue's advice, put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models. While shifting around the cardboard cut-outs of the accurate molecules on his office table, Watson realized in a stroke of inspiration that A, when joined with T, very nearly resembled a combination of C and G, and that each pair could hold together by forming hydrogen bonds. If A always paired with T, and likewise C with G, then not only were Chargaff's rules (that in DNA, the amount of A equals that of T, and C that of G) accounted for, but the pairs could be neatly fitted between the two helical sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA, the outside rails of the ladder. The bases connected to the two backbones at right angles while the backbones retained their regular shape as they wound around a common axis; similarly, the complementary pairing of the bases was compatible with the backbones, which ran in opposite directions to each other.\n\n(6). Watson and Crick published their findings in a one-page paper, with the understated title, \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,\" in the British scientific weekly, Nature, on April 25, 1953, illustrated with a schematic drawing of the double helix by Crick's wife, Odile. A coin toss decided the order in which they were named as authors. Foremost among the \"novel features\" of \"considerable biological interest\" they described was the pairing of the bases on the inside of the two DNA backbones: A=T and C=G. The pairing rule immediately suggested a copying mechanism for DNA: given the sequence of the bases in one strand, that of the other was automatically determined, which meant that when the two chains separated, each served as a template for a complementary new chain. Watson and Crick developed their ideas about genetic replication in the second article in Nature, published on May 30, 1953.\n\n(7). The two had shown that in DNA, form is function: the double-stranded molecule could both produce exact copies of itself and carry genetic instructions. During the following years, Crick elaborated on the implications of the double-helical model, advancing the hypothesis - revolutionary then but widely accepted since - that the sequence of the bases in DNA forms a code by which genetic information can be stored and transmitted. Although recognized today as one of the seminal scientific papers of the twentieth century, Watson and Crick's original article in Nature was not frequently cited at first; its true significance became apparent, and its circulation widened only towards the end of the 1950s. The structure of DNA they had proposed was shown to provide a mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, and when their conclusions were confirmed in the laboratory by Matthew Meselson, Crick himself immediately understood the significance of his and Watson's discovery.

      "text": "(1). Elementary schools in Europe and the Americas enforce stringent regulations on foods permitted on school property. It is the sensible route of action for educators and policy makers, whose job is to protect children from the dire consequences that emerge when immunocompromised individuals encounter allergens. Allergens refer to the group of particles that can elicit an immunological response upon entry to the body via the mouth, nose, skin, or through injection. Peanuts are a familiar culprit when it comes to food allergens. Other tree nuts such as almonds, cashews, walnuts, pecans, and pistachios are typical provocateurs. Common food allergens other than nuts include shellfish and milk. Injectional allergens can take the form of vaccines or insect venom such as bee stings, for example. Sometimes, the allergic reaction is idiopathic, meaning the stimulant is unidentified. Regardless of its nature and method of entry, an allergen can provoke a reaction that ranges from an itchy throat to anaphylactic shock. Many factors are implicated in the severity of the reaction, but one thing is for certain: anaphylactic shock is an acute, treacherous state that demands preventative action. For this reason, many schools not only ban peanuts, but stay far away from other known allergens such as other tree nuts, shellfish, and latex just to name a few.\n\n(2). The alarming prevalence of allergies in more developed countries has been deemed an ‘epidemic’ for the advantaged. There is mounting evidence to suggest an infant’s environment during early stages of development plays a critical role in susceptibility to anaphylaxis. The hygiene hypothesis is supported by formidable research that describes how an infant’s environment and particularly the method of birth has drastic repercussions on the infant’s allergic disposition. The theory postulates that a newborn’s lack of microbial exposure during infancy predisposes them to immune dysregulation and shock-like reactions. Several studies have associated lower risk of allergy with childhood environments involving poverty, large families, or close animal contacts. These risk factors are seldom seen in more privileged countries. Hygiene seems to affect not only childhood infection incidence but also intestinal colonization patterns. As such, allergists have ardently investigated the myriad of environmental factors that manipulate the gut microbiome during infancy. One of the factors that have proven to have a dramatic effect on immunological profile is the method of birthing.\n\n(3). Compared with vaginal delivery, birth by Caesarean section (C-section) leads to long-lasting changes in the neonatal intestinal flora, which have been associated with allergic reactions. C-section delivery, which deprives the baby of contact with the maternal vaginal, perineal, and fecal flora and causes delayed acquisition of a microbial profile that supports functional immunity. Although delivery via C-section as an isolated event is unlikely to have massive consequences in bacterial turnover in the gut, the maternal flora is of special importance for several reasons. Research has reported that maternal bacteria colonize the child’s gut more readily than exotic bacteria. Next, in the absence of bacterial input from the mother, the infant is more likely to be colonized with potentially opportunistic and pathogenic hospital bacteria. The introduction of foreign bacteria compromises the integrity of the gut colony by forming an impure mosaic of microorganisms. Third, studies have reported that babies from more developed countries, in contrast to babies from less developed countries, have reduced bacterial turnover. High turnover of translocating bacteria could provide the continuous stimulation necessary to prevent allergic diseases. In these cases, any factors further reducing the input of bacteria might have a noticeable effect. For instance, the effect of antibiotics has been reported to result in profound and lasting changes on the gut flora of Swedish babies, whereas Ethiopian babies quickly restored the lost colonies. Finally, the first bacteria colonizing the intestine might persist longer compared with bacteria arriving later since the immune system has not yet been established to regulate itself. While some allergists grapple with the intricacies of an infant’s microenvironment, others are fighting to protect the lives of those with perilous allergic proclivities.\n\n(4). The most severe form of an allergic reaction manifests as anaphylactic shock, which can be categorized as immunological or non-immunological, the former of which is the most common. The immunological response known as anaphylactic shock begins when the allergen is detected by B cells floating through the bloodstream. The identification of the allergen by B cells initiates the production and dispersion of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies throughout the body. IgE is a Y-shaped immunoprotein unique to the allergen response. Subsequently, IgE antibodies migrate and attach to the membrane of mast and basophil immune cells in a process called sensitization. Imagine an individual is genetically predisposed to anaphylaxis caused by peanut allergens. When this person first eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, they will feel fine since their immune system has not yet been sensitized. Upon subsequent exposure to peanuts, allergens will bind to the membranes of the person’s immune cells and initiate the chain of events leading to anaphylactic shock.\n\n(5). Once the sensitized allergens activate the IgE antibodies, two molecules propagate the immune response. First, cytokines are released to communicate the need for more white blood cells at the site of attack. The arrival of more white blood cells in turn stimulates the release of more cytokines. This positive feedback loop continues until the allergen has been neutralized. Second, the immune cells activated by the allergen release histamine, the worrisome twin of the allergic response. Histamine is a multi-modal hormone that mitigates the body’s vulnerability to the allergen. It acts as a vasodilator to decrease blood pressure and suppress the cardiovascular system’s capacity to meet the body’s oxygen demands. Moreover, it increases the permeability of the blood vessels leading to fluid leakage into tissues and hence, inflammation. Perhaps the most devastating act of histamine is bronchoconstriction, which impairs an individual’s ability to facilitate gas exchange. This could occur in conjunction with inflammation of the throat and significantly affect normal breathing. It is the combination of physical symptoms in the form of hives, itching, poor circulation, and diminished respiration that threaten the life of the individual in shock. In the non-immunological, or anaphylactoid form of the shock, the allergen bypasses the sensitization stage, and it elicits the release of cytokines and histamine by degrading the membranes of mast and basophil cells.\n\n(6). Anaphylactic shock can be further broken down into mild, moderate, and severe forms. Most allergic reactions are mild but there is a palpable life-threatening quality to the more serious responses. The more severe symptoms develop quickly and reach maximum intensity within 3-30 minutes. If the shock is biphasic, a quiescent period of 1–8 hours precedes a second outburst.\n\n(7). Considering the time-sensitive nature of anaphylactic shock, its treatment must be rapid and effective. Almost all individuals who are known to have severe allergic reactions carry an epi-pen. An epi-pen is a needle used to inject epinephrine into the individual to counter the effects of histamine. Epinephrine is a sympathetic hormone, meaning that it constricts the blood vessels, opens the throat and bronchioles, and enables the body to re-establish proper air and blood flow. If a person’s throat is closed, a ventilator may be used to forcedly supply concentrated oxygen into the lungs. In addition, IV fluids must be used to bring the blood volume back to normal levels to counteract fluid loss into the tissues. Next in the treatment process are antihistamines. Antihistamines act as antagonists: they disable histamine’s effects by blocking histamine receptors. Although this is an important step in the treatment process, antihistamines by themselves seldom achieve meaningful effects in treating life-threatening duress. Epinephrine must be the first, and most prominent drug used in the fight against anaphylactic shock.\n\n(8). There exists a certain level of polarity between health practitioners regarding what the most optimal treatment for anaphylactic shock should be. One school of thought strongly advocates for using epinephrine as the most immediate treatment that has an end-all, be-all effect. The other side supports the use of antihistamines to combat the inflammatory and vasodilatory effects of histamine. The bioactivation capacity of the two treatments are measurably different. Epinephrine administered via an epi-pen is injected directly into tissue through the needle, and almost instantaneously makes its way into the bloodstream to elicit sympathetic effects that restore regular function. On the other hand, antihistamines are often ingested in tablet form. As a result, they must travel to the stomach before being broken down and absorbed via gastrointestinal mechanics. This process may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, which puts forth a large window of time for the desired effects to take place. Although there is still heated debate over the use of antihistamines versus epinephrine, it is abundantly clear that in life-or-death scenarios, the quick action of epinephrine makes it the treatment of choice. Medical professionals are advised to keep themselves well-versed in anaphylaxis treatments to make the correct choice in urgent scenarios."

      "text": "(1). Elementary schools in Europe and the Americas enforce stringent regulations on foods permitted on school property. It is the sensible route of action for educators and policy makers, whose job is to protect children from the dire consequences that emerge when immunocompromised individuals encounter allergens. Allergens refer to the group of particles that can elicit an immunological response upon entry to the body via the mouth, nose, skin, or through injection. Peanuts are a familiar culprit when it comes to food allergens. Other tree nuts such as almonds, cashews, walnuts, pecans, and pistachios are typical provocateurs. Common food allergens other than nuts include shellfish and milk. Injectional allergens can take the form of vaccines or insect venom such as bee stings, for example. Sometimes, the allergic reaction is idiopathic, meaning the stimulant is unidentified. Regardless of its nature and method of entry, an allergen can provoke a reaction that ranges from an itchy throat to anaphylactic shock. Many factors are implicated in the severity of the reaction, but one thing is for certain: anaphylactic shock is an acute, treacherous state that demands preventative action. For this reason, many schools not only ban peanuts, but stay far away from other known allergens such as other tree nuts, shellfish, and latex just to name a few.\n\n(2). The alarming prevalence of allergies in more developed countries has been deemed an ‘epidemic’ for the advantaged. There is mounting evidence to suggest an infant’s environment during early stages of development plays a critical role in susceptibility to anaphylaxis. The hygiene hypothesis is supported by formidable research that describes how an infant’s environment and particularly the method of birth has drastic repercussions on the infant’s allergic disposition. The theory postulates that a newborn’s lack of microbial exposure during infancy predisposes them to immune dysregulation and shock-like reactions. Several studies have associated lower risk of allergy with childhood environments involving poverty, large families, or close animal contacts. These risk factors are seldom seen in more privileged countries. Hygiene seems to affect not only childhood infection incidence but also intestinal colonization patterns. As such, allergists have ardently investigated the myriad of environmental factors that manipulate the gut microbiome during infancy. One of the factors that have proven to have a dramatic effect on immunological profile is the method of birthing.\n\n(3). Compared with vaginal delivery, birth by Caesarean section (C-section) leads to long-lasting changes in the neonatal intestinal flora, which have been associated with allergic reactions. C-section delivery, which deprives the baby of contact with the maternal vaginal, perineal, and fecal flora and causes delayed acquisition of a microbial profile that supports functional immunity. Although delivery via C-section as an isolated event is unlikely to have massive consequences in bacterial turnover in the gut, the maternal flora is of special importance for several reasons. Research has reported that maternal bacteria colonize the child’s gut more readily than exotic bacteria. Next, in the absence of bacterial input from the mother, the infant is more likely to be colonized with potentially opportunistic and pathogenic hospital bacteria. The introduction of foreign bacteria compromises the integrity of the gut colony by forming an impure mosaic of microorganisms. Third, studies have reported that babies from more developed countries, in contrast to babies from less developed countries, have reduced bacterial turnover. High turnover of translocating bacteria could provide the continuous stimulation necessary to prevent allergic diseases. In these cases, any factors further reducing the input of bacteria might have a noticeable effect. For instance, the effect of antibiotics has been reported to result in profound and lasting changes on the gut flora of Swedish babies, whereas Ethiopian babies quickly restored the lost colonies. Finally, the first bacteria colonizing the intestine might persist longer compared with bacteria arriving later since the immune system has not yet been established to regulate itself. While some allergists grapple with the intricacies of an infant’s microenvironment, others are fighting to protect the lives of those with perilous allergic proclivities.\n\n(4). The most severe form of an allergic reaction manifests as anaphylactic shock, which can be categorized as immunological or non-immunological, the former of which is the most common. The immunological response known as anaphylactic shock begins when the allergen is detected by B cells floating through the bloodstream. The identification of the allergen by B cells initiates the production and dispersion of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies throughout the body. IgE is a Y-shaped immunoprotein unique to the allergen response. Subsequently, IgE antibodies migrate and attach to the membrane of mast and basophil immune cells in a process called sensitization. Imagine an individual is genetically predisposed to anaphylaxis caused by peanut allergens. When this person first eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, they will feel fine since their immune system has not yet been sensitized. Upon subsequent exposure to peanuts, allergens will bind to the membranes of the person’s immune cells and initiate the chain of events leading to anaphylactic shock.\n\n(5). Once the sensitized allergens activate the IgE antibodies, two molecules propagate the immune response. First, cytokines are released to communicate the need for more white blood cells at the site of attack. The arrival of more white blood cells in turn stimulates the release of more cytokines. This positive feedback loop continues until the allergen has been neutralized. Second, the immune cells activated by the allergen release histamine, the worrisome twin of the allergic response. Histamine is a multi-modal hormone that mitigates the body’s vulnerability to the allergen. It acts as a vasodilator to decrease blood pressure and suppress the cardiovascular system’s capacity to meet the body’s oxygen demands. Moreover, it increases the permeability of the blood vessels leading to fluid leakage into tissues and hence, inflammation. Perhaps the most devastating act of histamine is bronchoconstriction, which impairs an individual’s ability to facilitate gas exchange. This could occur in conjunction with inflammation of the throat and significantly affect normal breathing. It is the combination of physical symptoms in the form of hives, itching, poor circulation, and diminished respiration that threaten the life of the individual in shock. In the non-immunological, or anaphylactoid form of the shock, the allergen bypasses the sensitization stage, and it elicits the release of cytokines and histamine by degrading the membranes of mast and basophil cells.\n\n(6). Anaphylactic shock can be further broken down into mild, moderate, and severe forms. Most allergic reactions are mild but there is a palpable life-threatening quality to the more serious responses. The more severe symptoms develop quickly and reach maximum intensity within 3-30 minutes. If the shock is biphasic, a quiescent period of 1–8 hours precedes a second outburst.\n\n(7). Considering the time-sensitive nature of anaphylactic shock, its treatment must be rapid and effective. Almost all individuals who are known to have severe allergic reactions carry an epi-pen. An epi-pen is a needle used to inject epinephrine into the individual to counter the effects of histamine. Epinephrine is a sympathetic hormone, meaning that it constricts the blood vessels, opens the throat and bronchioles, and enables the body to re-establish proper air and blood flow. If a person’s throat is closed, a ventilator may be used to forcedly supply concentrated oxygen into the lungs. In addition, IV fluids must be used to bring the blood volume back to normal levels to counteract fluid loss into the tissues. Next in the treatment process are antihistamines. Antihistamines act as antagonists: they disable histamine’s effects by blocking histamine receptors. Although this is an important step in the treatment process, antihistamines by themselves seldom achieve meaningful effects in treating life-threatening duress. Epinephrine must be the first, and most prominent drug used in the fight against anaphylactic shock.\n\n(8). There exists a certain level of polarity between health practitioners regarding what the most optimal treatment for anaphylactic shock should be. One school of thought strongly advocates for using epinephrine as the most immediate treatment that has an end-all, be-all effect. The other side supports the use of antihistamines to combat the inflammatory and vasodilatory effects of histamine. The bioactivation capacity of the two treatments are measurably different. Epinephrine administered via an epi-pen is injected directly into tissue through the needle, and almost instantaneously makes its way into the bloodstream to elicit sympathetic effects that restore regular function. On the other hand, antihistamines are often ingested in tablet form. As a result, they must travel to the stomach before being broken down and absorbed via gastrointestinal mechanics. This process may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, which puts forth a large window of time for the desired effects to take place. Although there is still heated debate over the use of antihistamines versus epinephrine, it is abundantly clear that in life-or-death scenarios, the quick action of epinephrine makes it the treatment of choice. Medical professionals are advised to keep themselves well-versed in anaphylaxis treatments to make the correct choice in urgent scenarios."

The hygiene hypothesis is supported by formidable research that outline an infant’s environment, especially the method of birth, has drastic repercussions. The theory postulates that a newborn’s lack of microbial exposure during infancy predisposes them to immune dysregulation and shock-like reactions.” Given this information, one can deduce that people who are more well off likely live in more sterile conditions, which creates a “lack of microbial exposure” that in turn increases susceptibility to allergies. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Because said individuals are more likely to have the funds to detect their allergies – is incorrect because although this option may seem tempting since it makes logical sense, remember that correct answers must be supported by the passage. The author never discusses the relationship between economic status and allergy detection. Option B. Because said individuals have greater vulnerability to allergenic substances – is incorrect because this answer choice is rather vague and does not point out a specific mechanism for why more privileged people may be more vulnerable to more allergies. However, the author has certainly discussed specific mechanisms such as microbial exposure and the gut flora in paragraphs 2 and 3 for example. Because the question suggests choosing the best explanation, this option is too generic and would not be the best answer. Option C. Because said individuals live in urban areas, where population-wide research occurs – is incorrect because although paragraphs 2 and 3 discuss some studies about allergies, there is no mention of whether the act of actually conducting the studies has any impact on a population’s allergy susceptibility. Moreover, the author does not clarify whether these allergy studies are more frequently conducted in more well-off urban centers. Since this option lacks support from the passage, it cannot be correct. Option E. Because said individuals are more often delivered via C-section – is incorrect because although the author discusses the effects of C-section on susceptibility to allergies, there is no discussion of the frequency of C-sections in privileged versus poor populations. Since this option is not supported by the passage, it cannot be correct.",

Presence of B cells in a person with anaphylactic shock – is incorrect because paragraph 4 states: “anaphylactic shock begins when the allergen is detected by B cells floating through the bloodstream.” Thus, anaphylaxis of either form is always initiated by B cells as they must detect the allergen, and the allergen is required for both forms of anaphylaxis. Thus, this option does not correctly differentiate between the forms of anaphylaxis. Option B. Anaphylactoid is more common than anaphylactic – is incorrect because paragraph 4 states: “The most severe form of an allergic reaction manifests as anaphylactic shock, which can be categorized as immunological or non-immunological, the former of which is the most common.” Additionally, paragraph 5 supplements: “In the non-immunological, or anaphylactoid, form of the shock.” Together, these excerpts show that the non-immunological form of shock, also referred to as the anaphylactoid form, is less common, which is the opposite of what this answer choice states. Option D. The continuous proliferation of IgE antibodies in anaphylactic shock – is incorrect because paragraphs 4 and 5 discuss the role of IgE in sensitization. Once sensitization is complete, IgE no longer has a role and one can deduce that it is not constantly proliferated throughout the whole anaphylaxis process. Option E. Anaphylactic is more severe than anaphylactoid – is incorrect because paragraph 6 states: “Anaphylactic shock can be further broken down into mild, moderate, and severe forms.” Thus, both forms of anaphylactic shock can assume a wide range of symptoms.

The more severe symptoms develop quickly and reach maximum intensity within 3-30 minutes. If the shock is biphasic, a quiescent period of 1–8 hours precedes a second outburst.\n\n(7). Considering the time-sensitive nature of anaphylactic shock, its treatment must be rapid and effective. Almost all individuals who are known to have severe allergic reactions carry an epi-pen. An epi-pen is a needle used to inject epinephrine into the individual to counter the effects of histamine. Epinephrine is a sympathetic hormone, meaning that it constricts the blood vessels, opens the throat and bronchioles, and enables the body to re-establish proper air and blood flow. If a person’s throat is closed, a ventilator may be used to forcedly supply concentrated oxygen into the lungs. In addition, IV fluids must be used to bring the blood volume back to normal levels to counteract fluid loss into the tissues. Next in the treatment process are antihistamines. Antihistamines act as antagonists: they disable histamine’s effects by blocking histamine receptors. Although this is an important step in the treatment process, antihistamines by themselves seldom achieve meaningful effects in treating life-threatening duress. Epinephrine must be the first, and most prominent drug used in the fight against anaphylactic shock.\n\n(8). There exists a certain level of polarity between health practitioners regarding what the most optimal treatment for anaphylactic shock should be. One school of thought strongly advocates for using epinephrine as the most immediate treatment that has an end-all, be-all effect. The other side supports the use of antihistamines to combat the inflammatory and vasodilatory effects of histamine. The bioactivation capacity of the two treatments are measurably different. Epinephrine administered via an epi-pen is injected directly into tissue through the needle, and almost instantaneously makes its way into the bloodstream to elicit sympathetic effects that restore regular function. On the other hand, antihistamines are often ingested in tablet form. As a result, they must travel to the stomach before being broken down and absorbed via gastrointestinal mechanics. This process may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, which puts forth a large window of time for the desired effects to take place. Although there is still heated debate over the use of antihistamines versus epinephrine, it is abundantly clear that in life-or-death scenarios, the quick action of epinephrine makes it the treatment of choice. Medical professionals are advised to keep themselves well-versed in anaphylaxis treatments to make the correct choice in urgent scenarios."

      "text": "(1). Elementary schools in Europe and the Americas enforce stringent regulations on foods permitted on school property. It is the sensible route of action for educators and policy makers, whose job is to protect children from the dire consequences that emerge when immunocompromised individuals encounter allergens. Allergens refer to the group of particles that can elicit an immunological response upon entry to the body via the mouth, nose, skin, or through injection. Peanuts are a familiar culprit when it comes to food allergens. Other tree nuts such as almonds, cashews, walnuts, pecans, and pistachios are typical provocateurs. Common food allergens other than nuts include shellfish and milk. Injectional allergens can take the form of vaccines or insect venom such as bee stings, for example. Sometimes, the allergic reaction is idiopathic, meaning the stimulant is unidentified. Regardless of its nature and method of entry, an allergen can provoke a reaction that ranges from an itchy throat to anaphylactic shock. Many factors are implicated in the severity of the reaction, but one thing is for certain: anaphylactic shock is an acute, treacherous state that demands preventative action. For this reason, many schools not only ban peanuts, but stay far away from other known allergens such as other tree nuts, shellfish, and latex just to name a few.\n\n(2). The alarming prevalence of allergies in more developed countries has been deemed an ‘epidemic’ for the advantaged. There is mounting evidence to suggest an infant’s environment during early stages of development plays a critical role in susceptibility to anaphylaxis. The hygiene hypothesis is supported by formidable research that describes how an infant’s environment and particularly the method of birth has drastic repercussions on the infant’s allergic disposition. The theory postulates that a newborn’s lack of microbial exposure during infancy predisposes them to immune dysregulation and shock-like reactions. Several studies have associated lower risk of allergy with childhood environments involving poverty, large families, or close animal contacts. These risk factors are seldom seen in more privileged countries. Hygiene seems to affect not only childhood infection incidence but also intestinal colonization patterns. As such, allergists have ardently investigated the myriad of environmental factors that manipulate the gut microbiome during infancy. One of the factors that have proven to have a dramatic effect on immunological profile is the method of birthing.\n\n(3). Compared with vaginal delivery, birth by Caesarean section (C-section) leads to long-lasting changes in the neonatal intestinal flora, which have been associated with allergic reactions. C-section delivery, which deprives the baby of contact with the maternal vaginal, perineal, and fecal flora and causes delayed acquisition of a microbial profile that supports functional immunity. Although delivery via C-section as an isolated event is unlikely to have massive consequences in bacterial turnover in the gut, the maternal flora is of special importance for several reasons. Research has reported that maternal bacteria colonize the child’s gut more readily than exotic bacteria. Next, in the absence of bacterial input from the mother, the infant is more likely to be colonized with potentially opportunistic and pathogenic hospital bacteria. The introduction of foreign bacteria compromises the integrity of the gut colony by forming an impure mosaic of microorganisms. Third, studies have reported that babies from more developed countries, in contrast to babies from less developed countries, have reduced bacterial turnover. High turnover of translocating bacteria could provide the continuous stimulation necessary to prevent allergic diseases. In these cases, any factors further reducing the input of bacteria might have a noticeable effect. For instance, the effect of antibiotics has been reported to result in profound and lasting changes on the gut flora of Swedish babies, whereas Ethiopian babies quickly restored the lost colonies. Finally, the first bacteria colonizing the intestine might persist longer compared with bacteria arriving later since the immune system has not yet been established to regulate itself. While some allergists grapple with the intricacies of an infant’s microenvironment, others are fighting to protect the lives of those with perilous allergic proclivities.\n\n(4). The most severe form of an allergic reaction manifests as anaphylactic shock, which can be categorized as immunological or non-immunological, the former of which is the most common. The immunological response known as anaphylactic shock begins when the allergen is detected by B cells floating through the bloodstream. The identification of the allergen by B cells initiates the production and dispersion of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies throughout the body. IgE is a Y-shaped immunoprotein unique to the allergen response. Subsequently, IgE antibodies migrate and attach to the membrane of mast and basophil immune cells in a process called sensitization. Imagine an individual is genetically predisposed to anaphylaxis caused by peanut allergens. When this person first eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, they will feel fine since their immune system has not yet been sensitized. Upon subsequent exposure to peanuts, allergens will bind to the membranes of the person’s immune cells and initiate the chain of events leading to anaphylactic shock.\n\n(5). Once the sensitized allergens activate the IgE antibodies, two molecules propagate the immune response. First, cytokines are released to communicate the need for more white blood cells at the site of attack. The arrival of more white blood cells in turn stimulates the release of more cytokines. This positive feedback loop continues until the allergen has been neutralized. Second, the immune cells activated by the allergen release histamine, the worrisome twin of the allergic response. Histamine is a multi-modal hormone that mitigates the body’s vulnerability to the allergen. It acts as a vasodilator to decrease blood pressure and suppress the cardiovascular system’s capacity to meet the body’s oxygen demands. Moreover, it increases the permeability of the blood vessels leading to fluid leakage into tissues and hence, inflammation. Perhaps the most devastating act of histamine is bronchoconstriction, which impairs an individual’s ability to facilitate gas exchange. This could occur in conjunction with inflammation of the throat and significantly affect normal breathing. It is the combination of physical symptoms in the form of hives, itching, poor circulation, and diminished respiration that threaten the life of the individual in shock. In the non-immunological, or anaphylactoid form of the shock, the allergen bypasses the sensitization stage, and it elicits the release of cytokines and histamine by degrading the membranes of mast and basophil cells.\n\n(6). Anaphylactic shock can be further broken down into mild, moderate, and severe forms. Most allergic reactions are mild but there is a palpable life-threatening quality to the more serious responses. The more severe symptoms develop quickly and reach maximum intensity within 3-30 minutes. If the shock is biphasic, a quiescent period of 1–8 hours precedes a second outburst.\n\n(7).

An epi-pen is a needle used to inject epinephrine into the individual to counter the effects of histamine. Epinephrine is a sympathetic hormone, meaning that it constricts the blood vessels, opens the throat and bronchioles, and enables the body to re-establish proper air and blood flow. If a person’s throat is closed, a ventilator may be used to forcedly supply concentrated oxygen into the lungs. In addition, IV fluids must be used to bring the blood volume back to normal levels to counteract fluid loss into the tissues. Next in the treatment process are antihistamines. Antihistamines act as antagonists: they disable histamine’s effects by blocking histamine receptors. Although this is an important step in the treatment process, antihistamines by themselves seldom achieve meaningful effects in treating life-threatening duress. Epinephrine must be the first, and most prominent drug used in the fight against anaphylactic shock.\n\n(8).

This does not capture the author’s use of exotic, which is comparing maternal bacteria with foreign bacteria. There is no discussion of how climate relates to bacterial colonization, so this option cannot be correct. Option B. Peculiar – is incorrect because peculiar refers to things that are strange or unusual. However, the author uses exotic as a term to describe whether bacteria are maternal or not. There are no comments made on the commonness of the bacteria, so this option cannot be correct. Option C. Curious – is incorrect because similar to Option B, curious can refer to something as being strange or being eager to learn. Neither of these definitions fit with the author’s intention of distinguishing between maternal and foreign bacteria, so this option cannot be correct. Option E. Indigenous – is incorrect because the term “Indigenous” describes something that is native to a particular place.

It is the sensible route of action for educators and policy makers, whose job is to protect children from the dire consequences that emerge when immunocompromised individuals encounter allergens. Allergens refer to the group of particles that can elicit an immunological response upon entry to the body via the mouth, nose, skin, or through injection. Peanuts are a familiar culprit when it comes to food allergens. Other tree nuts such as almonds, cashews, walnuts, pecans, and pistachios are typical provocateurs. Common food allergens other than nuts include shellfish and milk. Injectional allergens can take the form of vaccines or insect venom such as bee stings, for example. Sometimes, the allergic reaction is idiopathic, meaning the stimulant is unidentified. Regardless of its nature and method of entry, an allergen can provoke a reaction that ranges from an itchy throat to anaphylactic shock. Many factors are implicated in the severity of the reaction, but one thing is for certain: anaphylactic shock is an acute, treacherous state that demands preventative action. For this reason, many schools not only ban peanuts, but stay far away from other known allergens such as other tree nuts, shellfish, and latex just to name a few.\n\n(2). The alarming prevalence of allergies in more developed countries has been deemed an ‘epidemic’ for the advantaged. There is mounting evidence to suggest an infant’s environment during early stages of development plays a critical role in susceptibility to anaphylaxis. The hygiene hypothesis is supported by formidable research that describes how an infant’s environment and particularly the method of birth has drastic repercussions on the infant’s allergic disposition. The theory postulates that a newborn’s lack of microbial exposure during infancy predisposes them to immune dysregulation and shock-like reactions. Several studies have associated lower risk of allergy with childhood environments involving poverty, large families, or close animal contacts. These risk factors are seldom seen in more privileged countries. Hygiene seems to affect not only childhood infection incidence but also intestinal colonization patterns. As such, allergists have ardently investigated the myriad of environmental factors that manipulate the gut microbiome during infancy. One of the factors that have proven to have a dramatic effect on immunological profile is the method of birthing.\n\n(3). Compared with vaginal delivery, birth by Caesarean section (C-section) leads to long-lasting changes in the neonatal intestinal flora, which have been associated with allergic reactions. C-section delivery, which deprives the baby of contact with the maternal vaginal, perineal, and fecal flora and causes delayed acquisition of a microbial profile that supports functional immunity. Although delivery via C-section as an isolated event is unlikely to have massive consequences in bacterial turnover in the gut, the maternal flora is of special importance for several reasons. Research has reported that maternal bacteria colonize the child’s gut more readily than exotic bacteria. Next, in the absence of bacterial input from the mother, the infant is more likely to be colonized with potentially opportunistic and pathogenic hospital bacteria. The introduction of foreign bacteria compromises the integrity of the gut colony by forming an impure mosaic of microorganisms. Third, studies have reported that babies from more developed countries, in contrast to babies from less developed countries, have reduced bacterial turnover. High turnover of translocating bacteria could provide the continuous stimulation necessary to prevent allergic diseases. In these cases, any factors further reducing the input of bacteria might have a noticeable effect. For instance, the effect of antibiotics has been reported to result in profound and lasting changes on the gut flora of Swedish babies, whereas Ethiopian babies quickly restored the lost colonies. Finally, the first bacteria colonizing the intestine might persist longer compared with bacteria arriving later since the immune system has not yet been established to regulate itself. While some allergists grapple with the intricacies of an infant’s microenvironment, others are fighting to protect the lives of those with perilous allergic proclivities.\n\n(4). The most severe form of an allergic reaction manifests as anaphylactic shock, which can be categorized as immunological or non-immunological, the former of which is the most common. The immunological response known as anaphylactic shock begins when the allergen is detected by B cells floating through the bloodstream. The identification of the allergen by B cells initiates the production and dispersion of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies throughout the body. IgE is a Y-shaped immunoprotein unique to the allergen response. Subsequently, IgE antibodies migrate and attach to the membrane of mast and basophil immune cells in a process called sensitization. Imagine an individual is genetically predisposed to anaphylaxis caused by peanut allergens. When this person first eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, they will feel fine since their immune system has not yet been sensitized. Upon subsequent exposure to peanuts, allergens will bind to the membranes of the person’s immune cells and initiate the chain of events leading to anaphylactic shock.\n\n(5). Once the sensitized allergens activate the IgE antibodies, two molecules propagate the immune response. First, cytokines are released to communicate the need for more white blood cells at the site of attack. The arrival of more white blood cells in turn stimulates the release of more cytokines. This positive feedback loop continues until the allergen has been neutralized. Second, the immune cells activated by the allergen release histamine, the worrisome twin of the allergic response. Histamine is a multi-modal hormone that mitigates the body’s vulnerability to the allergen. It acts as a vasodilator to decrease blood pressure and suppress the cardiovascular system’s capacity to meet the body’s oxygen demands. Moreover, it increases the permeability of the blood vessels leading to fluid leakage into tissues and hence, inflammation. Perhaps the most devastating act of histamine is bronchoconstriction, which impairs an individual’s ability to facilitate gas exchange. This could occur in conjunction with inflammation of the throat and significantly affect normal breathing. It is the combination of physical symptoms in the form of hives, itching, poor circulation, and diminished respiration that threaten the life of the individual in shock. In the non-immunological, or anaphylactoid form of the shock, the allergen bypasses the sensitization stage, and it elicits the release of cytokines and histamine by degrading the membranes of mast and basophil cells.\n\n(6). Anaphylactic shock can be further broken down into mild, moderate, and severe forms. Most allergic reactions are mild but there is a palpable life-threatening quality to the more serious responses. The more severe symptoms develop quickly and reach maximum intensity within 3-30 minutes. If the shock is biphasic, a quiescent period of 1–8 hours precedes a second outburst.\n\n(7). Considering the time-sensitive nature of anaphylactic shock, its treatment must be rapid and effective. Almost all individuals who are known to have severe allergic reactions carry an epi-pen. An epi-pen is a needle used to inject epinephrine into the individual to counter the effects of histamine. Epinephrine is a sympathetic hormone, meaning that it constricts the blood vessels, opens the throat and bronchioles, and enables the body to re-establish proper air and blood flow. If a person’s throat is closed, a ventilator may be used to forcedly supply concentrated oxygen into the lungs. In addition, IV fluids must be used to bring the blood volume back to normal levels to counteract fluid loss into the tissues. Next in the treatment process are antihistamines. Antihistamines act as antagonists: they disable histamine’s effects by blocking histamine receptors. Although this is an important step in the treatment process, antihistamines by themselves seldom achieve meaningful effects in treating life-threatening duress. Epinephrine must be the first, and most prominent drug used in the fight against anaphylactic shock.\n\n(8). There exists a certain level of polarity between health practitioners regarding what the most optimal treatment for anaphylactic shock should be. One school of thought strongly advocates for using epinephrine as the most immediate treatment that has an end-all, be-all effect. The other side supports the use of antihistamines to combat the inflammatory and vasodilatory effects of histamine. The bioactivation capacity of the two treatments are measurably different. Epinephrine administered via an epi-pen is injected directly into tissue through the needle, and almost instantaneously makes its way into the bloodstream to elicit sympathetic effects that restore regular function. On the other hand, antihistamines are often ingested in tablet form. As a result, they must travel to the stomach before being broken down and absorbed via gastrointestinal mechanics. This process may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, which puts forth a large window of time for the desired effects to take place. Although there is still heated debate over the use of antihistamines versus epinephrine, it is abundantly clear that in life-or-death scenarios, the quick action of epinephrine makes it the treatment of choice. Medical professionals are advised to keep themselves well-versed in anaphylaxis treatments to make the correct choice in urgent scenarios."

Epinephrine administered via an epi-pen is injected directly into tissue through the needle, and almost instantaneously makes its way into the bloodstream to elicit sympathetic effects that restore regular function. On the other hand, antihistamines are often ingested in tablet form. As a result, they must travel to the stomach before being broken down and absorbed via gastrointestinal mechanics. This process may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, which puts forth a large window of time for the desired effects to take place. Although there is still heated debate over the use of antihistamines versus epinephrine, it is abundantly clear that in life-or-death scenarios, the quick action of epinephrine makes it the treatment of choice.

Additionally, the two statements can be related to each other in a coherent manner. The passage suggests that anaphylactic shock can be quite dangerous and requires rapid treatment.

      "text": "(1). Elementary schools in Europe and the Americas enforce stringent regulations on foods permitted on school property. It is the sensible route of action for educators and policy makers, whose job is to protect children from the dire consequences that emerge when immunocompromised individuals encounter allergens. Allergens refer to the group of particles that can elicit an immunological response upon entry to the body via the mouth, nose, skin, or through injection. Peanuts are a familiar culprit when it comes to food allergens. Other tree nuts such as almonds, cashews, walnuts, pecans, and pistachios are typical provocateurs. Common food allergens other than nuts include shellfish and milk. Injectional allergens can take the form of vaccines or insect venom such as bee stings, for example. Sometimes, the allergic reaction is idiopathic, meaning the stimulant is unidentified. Regardless of its nature and method of entry, an allergen can provoke a reaction that ranges from an itchy throat to anaphylactic shock. Many factors are implicated in the severity of the reaction, but one thing is for certain: anaphylactic shock is an acute, treacherous state that demands preventative action. For this reason, many schools not only ban peanuts, but stay far away from other known allergens such as other tree nuts, shellfish, and latex just to name a few.\n\n(2). The alarming prevalence of allergies in more developed countries has been deemed an ‘epidemic’ for the advantaged. There is mounting evidence to suggest an infant’s environment during early stages of development plays a critical role in susceptibility to anaphylaxis. The hygiene hypothesis is supported by formidable research that describes how an infant’s environment and particularly the method of birth has drastic repercussions on the infant’s allergic disposition. The theory postulates that a newborn’s lack of microbial exposure during infancy predisposes them to immune dysregulation and shock-like reactions. Several studies have associated lower risk of allergy with childhood environments involving poverty, large families, or close animal contacts. These risk factors are seldom seen in more privileged countries. Hygiene seems to affect not only childhood infection incidence but also intestinal colonization patterns. As such, allergists have ardently investigated the myriad of environmental factors that manipulate the gut microbiome during infancy. One of the factors that have proven to have a dramatic effect on immunological profile is the method of birthing.\n\n(3). Compared with vaginal delivery, birth by Caesarean section (C-section) leads to long-lasting changes in the neonatal intestinal flora, which have been associated with allergic reactions. C-section delivery, which deprives the baby of contact with the maternal vaginal, perineal, and fecal flora and causes delayed acquisition of a microbial profile that supports functional immunity. Although delivery via C-section as an isolated event is unlikely to have massive consequences in bacterial turnover in the gut, the maternal flora is of special importance for several reasons. Research has reported that maternal bacteria colonize the child’s gut more readily than exotic bacteria. Next, in the absence of bacterial input from the mother, the infant is more likely to be colonized with potentially opportunistic and pathogenic hospital bacteria. The introduction of foreign bacteria compromises the integrity of the gut colony by forming an impure mosaic of microorganisms. Third, studies have reported that babies from more developed countries, in contrast to babies from less developed countries, have reduced bacterial turnover. High turnover of translocating bacteria could provide the continuous stimulation necessary to prevent allergic diseases. In these cases, any factors further reducing the input of bacteria might have a noticeable effect. For instance, the effect of antibiotics has been reported to result in profound and lasting changes on the gut flora of Swedish babies, whereas Ethiopian babies quickly restored the lost colonies. Finally, the first bacteria colonizing the intestine might persist longer compared with bacteria arriving later since the immune system has not yet been established to regulate itself. While some allergists grapple with the intricacies of an infant’s microenvironment, others are fighting to protect the lives of those with perilous allergic proclivities.\n\n(4). The most severe form of an allergic reaction manifests as anaphylactic shock, which can be categorized as immunological or non-immunological, the former of which is the most common. The immunological response known as anaphylactic shock begins when the allergen is detected by B cells floating through the bloodstream. The identification of the allergen by B cells initiates the production and dispersion of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies throughout the body. IgE is a Y-shaped immunoprotein unique to the allergen response. Subsequently, IgE antibodies migrate and attach to the membrane of mast and basophil immune cells in a process called sensitization. Imagine an individual is genetically predisposed to anaphylaxis caused by peanut allergens. When this person first eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, they will feel fine since their immune system has not yet been sensitized. Upon subsequent exposure to peanuts, allergens will bind to the membranes of the person’s immune cells and initiate the chain of events leading to anaphylactic shock.\n\n(5). Once the sensitized allergens activate the IgE antibodies, two molecules propagate the immune response. First, cytokines are released to communicate the need for more white blood cells at the site of attack. The arrival of more white blood cells in turn stimulates the release of more cytokines. This positive feedback loop continues until the allergen has been neutralized. Second, the immune cells activated by the allergen release histamine, the worrisome twin of the allergic response. Histamine is a multi-modal hormone that mitigates the body’s vulnerability to the allergen. It acts as a vasodilator to decrease blood pressure and suppress the cardiovascular system’s capacity to meet the body’s oxygen demands. Moreover, it increases the permeability of the blood vessels leading to fluid leakage into tissues and hence, inflammation. Perhaps the most devastating act of histamine is bronchoconstriction, which impairs an individual’s ability to facilitate gas exchange. This could occur in conjunction with inflammation of the throat and significantly affect normal breathing. It is the combination of physical symptoms in the form of hives, itching, poor circulation, and diminished respiration that threaten the life of the individual in shock. In the non-immunological, or anaphylactoid form of the shock, the allergen bypasses the sensitization stage, and it elicits the release of cytokines and histamine by degrading the membranes of mast and basophil cells.\n\n(6). Anaphylactic shock can be further broken down into mild, moderate, and severe forms. Most allergic reactions are mild but there is a palpable life-threatening quality to the more serious responses. The more severe symptoms develop quickly and reach maximum intensity within 3-30 minutes. If the shock is biphasic, a quiescent period of 1–8 hours precedes a second outburst.\n\n(7). Considering the time-sensitive nature of anaphylactic shock, its treatment must be rapid and effective. Almost all individuals who are known to have severe allergic reactions carry an epi-pen. An epi-pen is a needle used to inject epinephrine into the individual to counter the effects of histamine. Epinephrine is a sympathetic hormone, meaning that it constricts the blood vessels, opens the throat and bronchioles, and enables the body to re-establish proper air and blood flow. If a person’s throat is closed, a ventilator may be used to forcedly supply concentrated oxygen into the lungs. In addition, IV fluids must be used to bring the blood volume back to normal levels to counteract fluid loss into the tissues. Next in the treatment process are antihistamines. Antihistamines act as antagonists: they disable histamine’s effects by blocking histamine receptors. Although this is an important step in the treatment process, antihistamines by themselves seldom achieve meaningful effects in treating life-threatening duress. Epinephrine must be the first, and most prominent drug used in the fight against anaphylactic shock.\n\n(8). There exists a certain level of polarity between health practitioners regarding what the most optimal treatment for anaphylactic shock should be.

By means of caesarean section, which deprives the baby of contact with the maternal vaginal, perineal, and fecal flora, causes delayed acquisition of a microbial profile that supports functional immunity.” Essentially, the argument posited by the author states that C-section babies are more prone to allergies because of a disordered gut microbial composition. Hence, the ideal answer would provide evidence in support of allergies caused by C-section or a gut profile that has been negatively affected by C-section when compared to vaginal delivery .

The identification of the allergen by B cells initiates the production and dispersion of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies throughout the body.

Histamine is a multi-modal hormone that mitigates the body’s vulnerability to the allergen. It acts as a vasodilator to decrease blood pressure and suppress the cardiovascular system’s capacity to meet the body’s oxygen demands. Moreover, it increases the permeability of the blood vessels leading to fluid leakage into tissues and hence, inflammation. Perhaps the most devastating act of histamine is bronchoconstriction, which impairs an individual’s ability to facilitate gas exchange. This could occur in conjunction with inflammation of the throat and significantly affect normal breathing. It is the combination of physical symptoms in the form of hives, itching, poor circulation, and diminished respiration that threaten the life of the individual in shock. In the non-immunological, or anaphylactoid form of the shock, the allergen bypasses the sensitization stage, and it elicits the release of cytokines and histamine by degrading the membranes of mast and basophil cells.\n\n(6). Anaphylactic shock can be further broken down into mild, moderate, and severe forms. Most allergic reactions are mild but there is a palpable life-threatening quality to the more serious responses.

It is the sensible route of action for educators and policy makers, whose job is to protect children from the dire consequences that emerge when immunocompromised individuals encounter allergens. Allergens refer to the group of particles that can elicit an immunological response upon entry to the body via the mouth, nose, skin, or through injection. Peanuts are a familiar culprit when it comes to food allergens. Other tree nuts such as almonds, cashews, walnuts, pecans, and pistachios are typical provocateurs. Common food allergens other than nuts include shellfish and milk. Injectional allergens can take the form of vaccines or insect venom such as bee stings, for example. Sometimes, the allergic reaction is idiopathic, meaning the stimulant is unidentified.

In paragraph 5, the author states: “Second, the immune cells activated by the allergen release histamine, the worrisome twin of the allergic response.” Thus the statement is correct in that histamine is what makes the allergic response worrisome. The context of this quote is also a discussion of what happens during anaphylactic shock, so histamine is indeed present in the immunological form of the allergic response. Towards the end of paragraph 5, the author states: “In the non-immunological, or anaphylactoid form of the shock, the allergen bypasses the sensitization stage, and it elicits the release of cytokines and histamine by degrading the membranes of mast and basophil cells.” This indicates the reason is also correct as histamine was previously identified to be in anaphylactic shock and is now also found in anaphylactoid shock. Both the statement and reason are correct, but they are not related. That is, the reason is not a good explanation for the statement. The author identifies some reasons why histamine is dangerous in paragraph 5: “Perhaps the most devastating act of histamine is bronchoconstriction, which impairs an individual’s ability to facilitate gas exchange.” The effects of histamine, such as breathing impairment, are life-threatening and notably devoid in cytokines. Histamine is not dangerous simply because it is released in both forms of shock. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",

Perhaps the most devastating act of histamine is bronchoconstriction, which impairs an individual’s ability to facilitate gas exchange.

      "text": "(1). Elementary schools in Europe and the Americas enforce stringent regulations on foods permitted on school property. It is the sensible route of action for educators and policy makers, whose job is to protect children from the dire consequences that emerge when immunocompromised individuals encounter allergens. Allergens refer to the group of particles that can elicit an immunological response upon entry to the body via the mouth, nose, skin, or through injection. Peanuts are a familiar culprit when it comes to food allergens. Other tree nuts such as almonds, cashews, walnuts, pecans, and pistachios are typical provocateurs. Common food allergens other than nuts include shellfish and milk. Injectional allergens can take the form of vaccines or insect venom such as bee stings, for example. Sometimes, the allergic reaction is idiopathic, meaning the stimulant is unidentified. Regardless of its nature and method of entry, an allergen can provoke a reaction that ranges from an itchy throat to anaphylactic shock. Many factors are implicated in the severity of the reaction, but one thing is for certain: anaphylactic shock is an acute, treacherous state that demands preventative action. For this reason, many schools not only ban peanuts, but stay far away from other known allergens such as other tree nuts, shellfish, and latex just to name a few.\n\n(2). The alarming prevalence of allergies in more developed countries has been deemed an ‘epidemic’ for the advantaged. There is mounting evidence to suggest an infant’s environment during early stages of development plays a critical role in susceptibility to anaphylaxis. The hygiene hypothesis is supported by formidable research that describes how an infant’s environment and particularly the method of birth has drastic repercussions on the infant’s allergic disposition. The theory postulates that a newborn’s lack of microbial exposure during infancy predisposes them to immune dysregulation and shock-like reactions. Several studies have associated lower risk of allergy with childhood environments involving poverty, large families, or close animal contacts. These risk factors are seldom seen in more privileged countries. Hygiene seems to affect not only childhood infection incidence but also intestinal colonization patterns. As such, allergists have ardently investigated the myriad of environmental factors that manipulate the gut microbiome during infancy. One of the factors that have proven to have a dramatic effect on immunological profile is the method of birthing.\n\n(3). Compared with vaginal delivery, birth by Caesarean section (C-section) leads to long-lasting changes in the neonatal intestinal flora, which have been associated with allergic reactions. C-section delivery, which deprives the baby of contact with the maternal vaginal, perineal, and fecal flora and causes delayed acquisition of a microbial profile that supports functional immunity. Although delivery via C-section as an isolated event is unlikely to have massive consequences in bacterial turnover in the gut, the maternal flora is of special importance for several reasons. Research has reported that maternal bacteria colonize the child’s gut more readily than exotic bacteria. Next, in the absence of bacterial input from the mother, the infant is more likely to be colonized with potentially opportunistic and pathogenic hospital bacteria. The introduction of foreign bacteria compromises the integrity of the gut colony by forming an impure mosaic of microorganisms. Third, studies have reported that babies from more developed countries, in contrast to babies from less developed countries, have reduced bacterial turnover. High turnover of translocating bacteria could provide the continuous stimulation necessary to prevent allergic diseases. In these cases, any factors further reducing the input of bacteria might have a noticeable effect. For instance, the effect of antibiotics has been reported to result in profound and lasting changes on the gut flora of Swedish babies, whereas Ethiopian babies quickly restored the lost colonies. Finally, the first bacteria colonizing the intestine might persist longer compared with bacteria arriving later since the immune system has not yet been established to regulate itself. While some allergists grapple with the intricacies of an infant’s microenvironment, others are fighting to protect the lives of those with perilous allergic proclivities.\n\n(4). The most severe form of an allergic reaction manifests as anaphylactic shock, which can be categorized as immunological or non-immunological, the former of which is the most common. The immunological response known as anaphylactic shock begins when the allergen is detected by B cells floating through the bloodstream. The identification of the allergen by B cells initiates the production and dispersion of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies throughout the body. IgE is a Y-shaped immunoprotein unique to the allergen response. Subsequently, IgE antibodies migrate and attach to the membrane of mast and basophil immune cells in a process called sensitization. Imagine an individual is genetically predisposed to anaphylaxis caused by peanut allergens. When this person first eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, they will feel fine since their immune system has not yet been sensitized. Upon subsequent exposure to peanuts, allergens will bind to the membranes of the person’s immune cells and initiate the chain of events leading to anaphylactic shock.\n\n(5). Once the sensitized allergens activate the IgE antibodies, two molecules propagate the immune response. First, cytokines are released to communicate the need for more white blood cells at the site of attack. The arrival of more white blood cells in turn stimulates the release of more cytokines. This positive feedback loop continues until the allergen has been neutralized. Second, the immune cells activated by the allergen release histamine, the worrisome twin of the allergic response. Histamine is a multi-modal hormone that mitigates the body’s vulnerability to the allergen. It acts as a vasodilator to decrease blood pressure and suppress the cardiovascular system’s capacity to meet the body’s oxygen demands. Moreover, it increases the permeability of the blood vessels leading to fluid leakage into tissues and hence, inflammation. Perhaps the most devastating act of histamine is bronchoconstriction, which impairs an individual’s ability to facilitate gas exchange. This could occur in conjunction with inflammation of the throat and significantly affect normal breathing. It is the combination of physical symptoms in the form of hives, itching, poor circulation, and diminished respiration that threaten the life of the individual in shock. In the non-immunological, or anaphylactoid form of the shock, the allergen bypasses the sensitization stage, and it elicits the release of cytokines and histamine by degrading the membranes of mast and basophil cells.\n\n(6). Anaphylactic shock can be further broken down into mild, moderate, and severe forms. Most allergic reactions are mild but there is a palpable life-threatening quality to the more serious responses. The more severe symptoms develop quickly and reach maximum intensity within 3-30 minutes. If the shock is biphasic, a quiescent period of 1–8 hours precedes a second outburst.\n\n(7). Considering the time-sensitive nature of anaphylactic shock, its treatment must be rapid and effective. Almost all individuals who are known to have severe allergic reactions carry an epi-pen. An epi-pen is a needle used to inject epinephrine into the individual to counter the effects of histamine. Epinephrine is a sympathetic hormone, meaning that it constricts the blood vessels, opens the throat and bronchioles, and enables the body to re-establish proper air and blood flow. If a person’s throat is closed, a ventilator may be used to forcedly supply concentrated oxygen into the lungs. In addition, IV fluids must be used to bring the blood volume back to normal levels to counteract fluid loss into the tissues. Next in the treatment process are antihistamines. Antihistamines act as antagonists: they disable histamine’s effects by blocking histamine receptors. Although this is an important step in the treatment process, antihistamines by themselves seldom achieve meaningful effects in treating life-threatening duress. Epinephrine must be the first, and most prominent drug used in the fight against anaphylactic shock.\n\n(8). There exists a certain level of polarity between health practitioners regarding what the most optimal treatment for anaphylactic shock should be. One school of thought strongly advocates for using epinephrine as the most immediate treatment that has an end-all, be-all effect. The other side supports the use of antihistamines to combat the inflammatory and vasodilatory effects of histamine. The bioactivation capacity of the two treatments are measurably different. Epinephrine administered via an epi-pen is injected directly into tissue through the needle, and almost instantaneously makes its way into the bloodstream to elicit sympathetic effects that restore regular function. On the other hand, antihistamines are often ingested in tablet form. As a result, they must travel to the stomach before being broken down and absorbed via gastrointestinal mechanics. This process may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, which puts forth a large window of time for the desired effects to take place. Although there is still heated debate over the use of antihistamines versus epinephrine, it is abundantly clear that in life-or-death scenarios, the quick action of epinephrine makes it the treatment of choice. Medical professionals are advised to keep themselves well-versed in anaphylaxis treatments to make the correct choice in urgent scenarios."
