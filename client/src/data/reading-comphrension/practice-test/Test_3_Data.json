      "text": "(1). Inside the nucleus of cells, our genes are arranged along twisted, double-stranded molecules of DNA called “chromosomes.” At the ends of these chromosomes are stretches of DNA called telomeres, which protect our genetic data, make it possible for cells to divide, and hold some secrets about the processes behind age and cancer; in addition, telomeres are made up of a series of repetitive nucleotide sequences that play an important role in protecting our chromosomes and can also have an impact on aging in cells.\n\n(2). The word “telomere” originates from two Greek words: “telos” meaning end, and “meros” meaning part. The role of telomeres in protecting human DNA was first documented by scientists in the 1930s. One of the most prominent scientists of this era was Barbara McClintock, an American cytogeneticist (a scientist who studies the relationship between chromosomes and cell behavior). After observing how chromosomes stick to their neighbors when their ends are eliminated, in 1933, McClintock determined the existence of a protective tip on the end of chromosomes. Owing to her contributions in the field of cytogenetics, McClintock was the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine.\n\n(3). Without telomeres in place, chromosomes can either become damaged or fused with adjacent chromosomes, leading to cell degradation; since DNA in chromosomes forms instructions, which in turn tell cells how to behave, chromosomes are vital to the correct functioning of the human body. In fact, deoxyribonucleic acid can be found in the nucleus of each living cell; therefore, chromosomes, and the DNA they contain, are passed down from parents to each future generation. In this way, telomeres, given their important protective function for chromosomes, are an essential part of a healthy human body.\n\n(4). The number of individual cells in our bodies does not remain consistent throughout our lives since cells are continually reproducing through the process of copying themselves. This process is necessary to grow new skin, maintain our bones, produce more blood, and generally maintain the state of our bodies. In cell reproduction, DNA molecules are preserved, whereas telomeres become shorter each time the cell is copied; this shortening is mitigated to some extent by the replenishing enzyme telomerase, also known as telomerase reverse transcriptase. However, after an extensive time, the telomeres found on our chromosomes become increasingly shorter.\n\n(5). For the above reason, it has been said that the length of the telomeres found in a person’s cells is a true indicator of their biological age rather than their chronological age. Over our lifetime, repeated copying means that telomeres gradually shorten, and thus become more ineffectual. Telomere shortening is a manifestation of the natural aging process, but telomere shortening can also be a result of lifestyle factors, such as stress, smoking, obesity, and poor diet and exercise habits.\n\n(6). The link between telomere length and cellular aging has been well documented by the scientific community. In total, over 10,000 scientific articles have been published about telomeres. Important discoveries relating to the nature of telomeres and the inability of chromosomes to replicate their ends were made in the 1970s, though scientists at the time were yet to make the connection between telomere shortening and fixed number of cell divisions. It was only later that a private study by the biotechnology company, Geron, clearly showed the connection between telomere shortening and cellular aging.\n\n(7). Since Geron’s discovery, several important scientific studies have been made in the field of telomere research. In 2009, three scientists who established the link between the enzyme telomerase and telomere shortening were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine. The following year, Harvard Medical School released a study demonstrating that telomere shortening was a key cause of aging in cells.\n\n(8). Scientists have found a strong link between many age-related diseases and shortened telomeres. A study conducted by the University of Utah showed that individuals over the age of 60, whose cells contained shorter telomeres, were three times more likely to die of heart disease and eight times more likely to die from infectious disease compared to participants in the same age group with longer telomeres. More specific impacts of telomere shortening documented by scientific studies include a weakened immune system, hardening of the arteries, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and lowered bone density in women. It has also been documented that the rate of telomere shortening is more extreme in men compared to women.\n\n(9). Furthermore, sufferers of the disease, dyskeratosis congenita experience an escalated rate of telomere shortening; documented effects of this disease not only include premature aging and death, but also increased incidence of severe infection, leukemia, intestinal disorder, cirrhosis (destructive scar tissue in the liver), and pulmonary fibrosis (a toughening of lung tissue, which can be fatal). Other symptoms of dyskeratosis congenita are impaired wound healing, bone softening, learning disabilities, as well as factors commonly associated with aging, such as balding or graying of the hair and skin spots. Scientists believe that the previously mentioned disorders, all of which involve tissues within cells that have a higher rate of reproduction, are a result of the presence of shortened telomeres.\n\n(10). Extensive research has been done looking into the connection between telomeres and cancer. Increased cell reproduction is a common feature in many types of cancer; such a heightened rate of cell division results in an escalation of telomere shortening. This phenomenon has been especially observed in pancreatic, bone, prostate, bladder, lung, kidney, and head and neck cancers. In most instances, cells protect themselves by increasing telomerase production, thus keeping the telomeres from reducing. However, in extreme cases, such as escalation of cell reproduction can cause cell death due to the over-shortening of telomeres.\n\n(11). Some researchers propose the use of telomerase as a method of cancer detection, but others go a step further and argue that a potential form of cancer treatment could involve halting the production of telomerase, thus eliminating cancer cells. One study conducted by scientists involved blocking telomerase activity within human breast and prostate cancer cells in the laboratory, which caused the cancer cells to die. However, the risks associated with this type of treatment include reduced fertility, impairment of the natural processes associated with healing wounds in the human body, and loss of blood and immune cell production.\n\n(12). Some researchers have identified longer telomeres and telomerase as indicative of an increased risk of cancer. Conversely, others have argued that increased telomere length may protect against cancer, bearing in mind the link between cancer and shortened telomeres. Scientists continue to conduct studies about telomeres, including the possibilities and potential impacts of halting or reversing the process of telomere shortening. It is possible that temporary activation of telomerase could reverse the shortening of telomeres and slow the aging process in cells. Researchers have proposed drug treatments, gene therapy, and metabolic suppression as methods of reversing telomere shortening - however, these theories have yet to be definitively proven as effectual in humans. Optimistically, scientific studies have demonstrated a link between telomere lengthening and reversal of the signs of aging in species of mice and worms.\n\n(13). One area of science that has sparked interest is studies measuring telomere length; a method for gauging telomere length in cells involves using an oligonucleotide probe and phosphoimager screen or autoradiographic film to determine the length of the telomeres on a chromosome. A second method is called the “Q-FISH methodology,” named so because it employs fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to measure telomere length. However, a large amount of genetic material, up to 20 micrograms, is required to use this method, in addition to intensive labor; for these reasons, it is not a method widely employed in large-scale research. A third technique, called “single telomere elongation length analysis (STELA),” allows researchers to examine specific telomere ends, though this technique is only appropriate for shorter telomeres.\n\n(14). Several scientists have questioned the efficacy of telomere length measurement, and it has been criticized as inappropriate for widespread clinical and personal use. Prominent scientist and Physiology/Medicine Nobel prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn co-founded a company offering clinical telomerase length measuring services, but later resigned, citing concerns over how telomere-related health processes were being controlled and managed. Nonetheless, many laboratories continue to offer telomere length measurement services as a commercial enterprise.\n\n(15). A proposed area for further study and research involves using telomerase to assist with the mass production of so-called “immortal” cells. These cells could be cultured in the lab and transplanted into humans to treat a wide range of diseases. Telomerase is an essential part of this process because it allows scientists to continue to culture and reproduce cells in the lab without such cells breaking down or becoming cancerous due to the over-shortening of their telomeres. Using this process, insulin-producing cells could be engineered in the lab and transplanted to treat patients with diabetes; likewise, doctors could transplant muscle cells to treat those suffering from muscle dystrophy and transplant cartilage cells to treat arthritis. A further use for such lab-engineered cells could be to test new drugs and develop gene therapies."

Since the first statement in the question makes a claim about the role of telomeres and thus makes a claim related to a basic piece of information about telomeres, we can guess that the paragraph telling us whether the first statement is true or false will probably be found early in the passage. In paragraph 3, the author discusses telomeres and mentions the statement below. This tells us that telomeres do play an essential role in maintaining a healthy human body. Thus, the statement is correct. “In this way, telomeres, given their important protective function for chromosomes, are an essential part of a healthy human body.” We should now ascertain whether the reason given in the question is true or false; to do so, consider the fact that, as with the statement given in the question, the reason also pertains to the function of telomeres. As we have established above, paragraph 3 discusses the function of telomeres. Thus, we can presume that the information needed to establish whether the reason in the question is true or false can be found in or around the same section of the passage as paragraph 3. Indeed, the author mentions the statement below in paragraph 4. This does not imply that telomeres can regulate and control cell reproduction. This tells us that the reason is incorrect. “In cell reproduction, DNA molecules are preserved, whereas telomeres become shorter each time the cell is copied… “ Thus, the statement is correct, but the reason is incorrect.

Furthermore, sufferers of the disease, dyskeratosis congenita experience an escalated rate of telomere shortening; documented effects of this disease not only include premature aging and death, but also increased incidence of severe infection, leukemia, intestinal disorder, cirrhosis (destructive scar tissue in the liver), and pulmonary fibrosis (a toughening of lung tissue, which can be fatal). Other symptoms of dyskeratosis congenita are impaired wound healing, bone softening, learning disabilities, as well as factors commonly associated with aging, such as balding or graying of the hair and skin spots. Scientists believe that the previously mentioned disorders, all of which involve tissues within cells that have a higher rate of reproduction, are a result of the presence of shortened telomeres.\n\n(10). Extensive research has been done looking into the connection between telomeres and cancer. Increased cell reproduction is a common feature in many types of cancer; such a heightened rate of cell division results in an escalation of telomere shortening. This phenomenon has been especially observed in pancreatic, bone, prostate, bladder, lung, kidney, and head and neck cancers. In most instances, cells protect themselves by increasing telomerase production, thus keeping the telomeres from reducing. However, in extreme cases, such as escalation of cell reproduction can cause cell death due to the over-shortening of telomeres.\n\n(11). Some researchers propose the use of telomerase as a method of cancer detection, but others go a step further and argue that a potential form of cancer treatment could involve halting the production of telomerase, thus eliminating cancer cells. One study conducted by scientists involved blocking telomerase activity within human breast and prostate cancer cells in the laboratory, which caused the cancer cells to die. However, the risks associated with this type of treatment include reduced fertility, impairment of the natural processes associated with healing wounds in the human body, and loss of blood and immune cell production.\n\n(12). Some researchers have identified longer telomeres and telomerase as indicative of an increased risk of cancer. Conversely, others have argued that increased telomere length may protect against cancer, bearing in mind the link between cancer and shortened telomeres. Scientists continue to conduct studies about telomeres, including the possibilities and potential impacts of halting or reversing the process of telomere shortening. It is possible that temporary activation of telomerase could reverse the shortening of telomeres and slow the aging process in cells. Researchers have proposed drug treatments, gene therapy, and metabolic suppression as methods of reversing telomere shortening - however, these theories have yet to be definitively proven as effectual in humans. Optimistically, scientific studies have demonstrated a link between telomere lengthening and reversal of the signs of aging in species of mice and worms.\n\n(13). One area of science that has sparked interest is studies measuring telomere length; a method for gauging telomere length in cells involves using an oligonucleotide probe and phosphoimager screen or autoradiographic film to determine the length of the telomeres on a chromosome. A second method is called the “Q-FISH methodology,” named so because it employs fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to measure telomere length. However, a large amount of genetic material, up to 20 micrograms, is required to use this method, in addition to intensive labor; for these reasons, it is not a method widely employed in large-scale research. A third technique, called “single telomere elongation length analysis (STELA),” allows researchers to examine specific telomere ends, though this technique is only appropriate for shorter telomeres.\n\n(14). Several scientists have questioned the efficacy of telomere length measurement, and it has been criticized as inappropriate for widespread clinical and personal use. Prominent scientist and Physiology/Medicine Nobel prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn co-founded a company offering clinical telomerase length measuring services, but later resigned, citing concerns over how telomere-related health processes were being controlled and managed. Nonetheless, many laboratories continue to offer telomere length measurement services as a commercial enterprise.\n\n(15). A proposed area for further study and research involves using telomerase to assist with the mass production of so-called “immortal” cells. These cells could be cultured in the lab and transplanted into humans to treat a wide range of diseases. Telomerase is an essential part of this process because it allows scientists to continue to culture and reproduce cells in the lab without such cells breaking down or becoming cancerous due to the over-shortening of their telomeres. Using this process, insulin-producing cells could be engineered in the lab and transplanted to treat patients with diabetes; likewise, doctors could transplant muscle cells to treat those suffering from muscle dystrophy and transplant cartilage cells to treat arthritis. A further use for such lab-engineered cells could be to test new drugs and develop gene therapies."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, notice that it asks for information regarding treatments that hinder telomerase; now scan the passage for a paragraph or paragraphs discussing this topic. This type of treatment is discussed most in-depth in the eleventh paragraph of the passage. Paragraph 11 reads: “…others go a step further and argue that a potential form of cancer treatment could involve halting the production of telomerase, thus eliminating cancer cells. One study conducted by scientists involved blocking telomerase activity within human breast and prostate cancer cells in the laboratory, which caused the cancer cells to die; however, the risks associated with this type of treatment include reduced fertility, impairment of the natural processes associated with healing wounds in the human body, and loss of blood and immune cell production.” If we scan the list of risks associated with the halting of telomerase and then return to the answer choices given in the options, the only match is the second option choice to the final risk listed; this is because the increased risk for diseases would be an outcome of loss of immune cell production. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. The chance of cellular necrosis is greater – is incorrect because, in paragraph 10, the author states: “One study conducted by scientists involved blocking telomerase activity within human breast and prostate cancer cells in the laboratory, which caused the cancer cells to die…” This does not mean the same as telomerase treatments increasing the odds of cell necrosis, and it is not listed as one of the risks for the treatment; thus, Option A is incorrect. Option C. It causes uncontrolled apoptosis – is incorrect because, in paragraph 10, the author states: “In extreme cases, such an escalation of cell reproduction can cause cell death due to the over-shortening of telomeres.” This does not mean the same as telomerase treatments always causing apoptosis, and it is not listed as one of the risks for the treatment; thus, Option C is incorrect. Option D. Studies have connected lack of telomerase to the growth of tumours – is incorrect because there are no studies mentioned in the passage that link the absence of telomerase to the creation of tumors. Option E. It impedes the production of telomeres in cells, the effects of which haven’t been studied – is incorrect because this is a false statement; while the treatments mentioned do block telomerase production in cells, the effects have been studied. For instance, paragraph 4 states: “One study conducted by scientists involved blocking telomerase activity within human breast and prostate cancer cells in the laboratory, which caused the cancer cells to die…”",

      "title": "Passage 1",
      "text": "(1). Inside the nucleus of cells, our genes are arranged along twisted, double-stranded molecules of DNA called “chromosomes.” At the ends of these chromosomes are stretches of DNA called telomeres, which protect our genetic data, make it possible for cells to divide, and hold some secrets about the processes behind age and cancer; in addition, telomeres are made up of a series of repetitive nucleotide sequences that play an important role in protecting our chromosomes and can also have an impact on aging in cells.\n\n(2). The word “telomere” originates from two Greek words: “telos” meaning end, and “meros” meaning part. The role of telomeres in protecting human DNA was first documented by scientists in the 1930s. One of the most prominent scientists of this era was Barbara McClintock, an American cytogeneticist (a scientist who studies the relationship between chromosomes and cell behavior). After observing how chromosomes stick to their neighbors when their ends are eliminated, in 1933, McClintock determined the existence of a protective tip on the end of chromosomes. Owing to her contributions in the field of cytogenetics, McClintock was the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine.\n\n(3). Without telomeres in place, chromosomes can either become damaged or fused with adjacent chromosomes, leading to cell degradation; since DNA in chromosomes forms instructions, which in turn tell cells how to behave, chromosomes are vital to the correct functioning of the human body. In fact, deoxyribonucleic acid can be found in the nucleus of each living cell; therefore, chromosomes, and the DNA they contain, are passed down from parents to each future generation. In this way, telomeres, given their important protective function for chromosomes, are an essential part of a healthy human body.\n\n(4). The number of individual cells in our bodies does not remain consistent throughout our lives since cells are continually reproducing through the process of copying themselves. This process is necessary to grow new skin, maintain our bones, produce more blood, and generally maintain the state of our bodies. In cell reproduction, DNA molecules are preserved, whereas telomeres become shorter each time the cell is copied; this shortening is mitigated to some extent by the replenishing enzyme telomerase, also known as telomerase reverse transcriptase. However, after an extensive time, the telomeres found on our chromosomes become increasingly shorter.\n\n(5). For the above reason, it has been said that the length of the telomeres found in a person’s cells is a true indicator of their biological age rather than their chronological age. Over our lifetime, repeated copying means that telomeres gradually shorten, and thus become more ineffectual. Telomere shortening is a manifestation of the natural aging process, but telomere shortening can also be a result of lifestyle factors, such as stress, smoking, obesity, and poor diet and exercise habits.\n\n(6). The link between telomere length and cellular aging has been well documented by the scientific community. In total, over 10,000 scientific articles have been published about telomeres. Important discoveries relating to the nature of telomeres and the inability of chromosomes to replicate their ends were made in the 1970s, though scientists at the time were yet to make the connection between telomere shortening and fixed number of cell divisions. It was only later that a private study by the biotechnology company, Geron, clearly showed the connection between telomere shortening and cellular aging.\n\n(7). Since Geron’s discovery, several important scientific studies have been made in the field of telomere research. In 2009, three scientists who established the link between the enzyme telomerase and telomere shortening were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine. The following year, Harvard Medical School released a study demonstrating that telomere shortening was a key cause of aging in cells.\n\n(8). Scientists have found a strong link between many age-related diseases and shortened telomeres. A study conducted by the University of Utah showed that individuals over the age of 60, whose cells contained shorter telomeres, were three times more likely to die of heart disease and eight times more likely to die from infectious disease compared to participants in the same age group with longer telomeres. More specific impacts of telomere shortening documented by scientific studies include a weakened immune system, hardening of the arteries, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and lowered bone density in women. It has also been documented that the rate of telomere shortening is more extreme in men compared to women.\n\n(9). Furthermore, sufferers of the disease, dyskeratosis congenita experience an escalated rate of telomere shortening; documented effects of this disease not only include premature aging and death, but also increased incidence of severe infection, leukemia, intestinal disorder, cirrhosis (destructive scar tissue in the liver), and pulmonary fibrosis (a toughening of lung tissue, which can be fatal). Other symptoms of dyskeratosis congenita are impaired wound healing, bone softening, learning disabilities, as well as factors commonly associated with aging, such as balding or graying of the hair and skin spots.

      "text": "(1). Inside the nucleus of cells, our genes are arranged along twisted, double-stranded molecules of DNA called “chromosomes.” At the ends of these chromosomes are stretches of DNA called telomeres, which protect our genetic data, make it possible for cells to divide, and hold some secrets about the processes behind age and cancer; in addition, telomeres are made up of a series of repetitive nucleotide sequences that play an important role in protecting our chromosomes and can also have an impact on aging in cells.\n\n(2). The word “telomere” originates from two Greek words: “telos” meaning end, and “meros” meaning part. The role of telomeres in protecting human DNA was first documented by scientists in the 1930s. One of the most prominent scientists of this era was Barbara McClintock, an American cytogeneticist (a scientist who studies the relationship between chromosomes and cell behavior). After observing how chromosomes stick to their neighbors when their ends are eliminated, in 1933, McClintock determined the existence of a protective tip on the end of chromosomes. Owing to her contributions in the field of cytogenetics, McClintock was the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine.\n\n(3). Without telomeres in place, chromosomes can either become damaged or fused with adjacent chromosomes, leading to cell degradation; since DNA in chromosomes forms instructions, which in turn tell cells how to behave, chromosomes are vital to the correct functioning of the human body. In fact, deoxyribonucleic acid can be found in the nucleus of each living cell; therefore, chromosomes, and the DNA they contain, are passed down from parents to each future generation. In this way, telomeres, given their important protective function for chromosomes, are an essential part of a healthy human body.\n\n(4). The number of individual cells in our bodies does not remain consistent throughout our lives since cells are continually reproducing through the process of copying themselves. This process is necessary to grow new skin, maintain our bones, produce more blood, and generally maintain the state of our bodies. In cell reproduction, DNA molecules are preserved, whereas telomeres become shorter each time the cell is copied; this shortening is mitigated to some extent by the replenishing enzyme telomerase, also known as telomerase reverse transcriptase. However, after an extensive time, the telomeres found on our chromosomes become increasingly shorter.\n\n(5). For the above reason, it has been said that the length of the telomeres found in a person’s cells is a true indicator of their biological age rather than their chronological age. Over our lifetime, repeated copying means that telomeres gradually shorten, and thus become more ineffectual. Telomere shortening is a manifestation of the natural aging process, but telomere shortening can also be a result of lifestyle factors, such as stress, smoking, obesity, and poor diet and exercise habits.\n\n(6). The link between telomere length and cellular aging has been well documented by the scientific community. In total, over 10,000 scientific articles have been published about telomeres. Important discoveries relating to the nature of telomeres and the inability of chromosomes to replicate their ends were made in the 1970s, though scientists at the time were yet to make the connection between telomere shortening and fixed number of cell divisions. It was only later that a private study by the biotechnology company, Geron, clearly showed the connection between telomere shortening and cellular aging.\n\n(7). Since Geron’s discovery, several important scientific studies have been made in the field of telomere research. In 2009, three scientists who established the link between the enzyme telomerase and telomere shortening were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine. The following year, Harvard Medical School released a study demonstrating that telomere shortening was a key cause of aging in cells.\n\n(8). Scientists have found a strong link between many age-related diseases and shortened telomeres. A study conducted by the University of Utah showed that individuals over the age of 60, whose cells contained shorter telomeres, were three times more likely to die of heart disease and eight times more likely to die from infectious disease compared to participants in the same age group with longer telomeres. More specific impacts of telomere shortening documented by scientific studies include a weakened immune system, hardening of the arteries, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and lowered bone density in women. It has also been documented that the rate of telomere shortening is more extreme in men compared to women.\n\n(9). Furthermore, sufferers of the disease, dyskeratosis congenita experience an escalated rate of telomere shortening; documented effects of this disease not only include premature aging and death, but also increased incidence of severe infection, leukemia, intestinal disorder, cirrhosis (destructive scar tissue in the liver), and pulmonary fibrosis (a toughening of lung tissue, which can be fatal). Other symptoms of dyskeratosis congenita are impaired wound healing, bone softening, learning disabilities, as well as factors commonly associated with aging, such as balding or graying of the hair and skin spots. Scientists believe that the previously mentioned disorders, all of which involve tissues within cells that have a higher rate of reproduction, are a result of the presence of shortened telomeres.\n\n(10). Extensive research has been done looking into the connection between telomeres and cancer. Increased cell reproduction is a common feature in many types of cancer; such a heightened rate of cell division results in an escalation of telomere shortening. This phenomenon has been especially observed in pancreatic, bone, prostate, bladder, lung, kidney, and head and neck cancers. In most instances, cells protect themselves by increasing telomerase production, thus keeping the telomeres from reducing. However, in extreme cases, such as escalation of cell reproduction can cause cell death due to the over-shortening of telomeres.\n\n(11). Some researchers propose the use of telomerase as a method of cancer detection, but others go a step further and argue that a potential form of cancer treatment could involve halting the production of telomerase, thus eliminating cancer cells. One study conducted by scientists involved blocking telomerase activity within human breast and prostate cancer cells in the laboratory, which caused the cancer cells to die. However, the risks associated with this type of treatment include reduced fertility, impairment of the natural processes associated with healing wounds in the human body, and loss of blood and immune cell production.\n\n(12). Some researchers have identified longer telomeres and telomerase as indicative of an increased risk of cancer. Conversely, others have argued that increased telomere length may protect against cancer, bearing in mind the link between cancer and shortened telomeres. Scientists continue to conduct studies about telomeres, including the possibilities and potential impacts of halting or reversing the process of telomere shortening. It is possible that temporary activation of telomerase could reverse the shortening of telomeres and slow the aging process in cells. Researchers have proposed drug treatments, gene therapy, and metabolic suppression as methods of reversing telomere shortening - however, these theories have yet to be definitively proven as effectual in humans. Optimistically, scientific studies have demonstrated a link between telomere lengthening and reversal of the signs of aging in species of mice and worms.\n\n(13). One area of science that has sparked interest is studies measuring telomere length; a method for gauging telomere length in cells involves using an oligonucleotide probe and phosphoimager screen or autoradiographic film to determine the length of the telomeres on a chromosome. A second method is called the “Q-FISH methodology,” named so because it employs fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to measure telomere length. However, a large amount of genetic material, up to 20 micrograms, is required to use this method, in addition to intensive labor; for these reasons, it is not a method widely employed in large-scale research. A third technique, called “single telomere elongation length analysis (STELA),” allows researchers to examine specific telomere ends, though this technique is only appropriate for shorter telomeres.\n\n(14). Several scientists have questioned the efficacy of telomere length measurement, and it has been criticized as inappropriate for widespread clinical and personal use. Prominent scientist and Physiology/Medicine Nobel prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn co-founded a company offering clinical telomerase length measuring services, but later resigned, citing concerns over how telomere-related health processes were being controlled and managed. Nonetheless, many laboratories continue to offer telomere length measurement services as a commercial enterprise.\n\n(15). A proposed area for further study and research involves using telomerase to assist with the mass production of so-called “immortal” cells. These cells could be cultured in the lab and transplanted into humans to treat a wide range of diseases. Telomerase is an essential part of this process because it allows scientists to continue to culture and reproduce cells in the lab without such cells breaking down or becoming cancerous due to the over-shortening of their telomeres. Using this process, insulin-producing cells could be engineered in the lab and transplanted to treat patients with diabetes; likewise, doctors could transplant muscle cells to treat those suffering from muscle dystrophy and transplant cartilage cells to treat arthritis. A further use for such lab-engineered cells could be to test new drugs and develop gene therapies."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should read the paragraph in question (paragraph 8) carefully. Having done so, we should then divide the paragraph into its main points and select an answer choice that encompasses said points. Part 1 of paragraph 8 tells us that shortened telomeres can cause negative health effects. It reads: “Scientists have found a strong link between many age-related diseases and shortened telomeres. A study conducted by the University of Utah showed that individuals over the age of 60, whose cells contained shorter telomeres, were three times more likely to die of heart disease…” Part 2 tells us that the negative health effects of shortened telomeres can be extreme. It reads: “More specific impacts of telomere shortening documented by scientific studies include a weakened immune system, hardening of the arteries, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and lowered bone density in women.” Part 3 tells us that men may be at a higher risk for shortened telomeres compared to women. It reads: “It has also been documented that the rate of telomere shortening is more extreme in men compared to women.” We should now summarize the sections of paragraph 8 that we have divided above; by doing so, we can determine its main idea. Summarizing the divided sections of paragraph 8, we can say that shortened telomeres have the potential to cause extremely negative health effects and that men are at higher risk for shortened telomeres than women. Only the third answer choice in the options matches this summary in its entirety. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Men and the elderly are at higher risk of accelerated aging – is incorrect because this is a false statement. Paragraph 8 only mentions that “individuals over the age of 60, whose cells contained shorter telomeres, were three times more likely to die of heart disease, and eight times more likely to die from infectious disease, compared to participants in the same age group with longer telomeres.” Paragraph 8 does not imply that those with shortened telomeres are at a higher risk for accelerated aging, and thus Option A is incorrect. Additionally, Option A is not representative of the entirety of paragraph 8. Option B. The risk of contacting an infectious disease is increased with shortened telomeres – is incorrect because this is an incorrect statement. Paragraph 8 states: “A study conducted by the University of Utah showed that individuals over the age of 60, whose cells contained shorter telomeres, were three times more likely to die of heart disease, and eight times more likely to die from infectious disease, compared to participants in the same age group with longer telomeres.” Increased likelihood of dying from an infectious disease is not the same as increased likelihood of contracting an infectious disease; it only means that an affected individual is more likely to die from said disease. Thus, Option B is incorrect. Additionally, Option B is not representative of the entirety of paragraph 8. Option D. To increase telomere length, individuals must assess their health and consult an expert – is incorrect because the idea of consulting a clinician to increase telomere length is not mentioned in paragraph 8; therefore, it cannot be the main idea. Option E. Telomere shortening is the leading cause of most immune diseases – is incorrect because this is a false statement. Telomere shortening as the leading cause of most immune diseases is not mentioned in paragraph 8 and therefore cannot be its main idea.",

Owing to her contributions in the field of cytogenetics, McClintock was the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine.\n\n(3). Without telomeres in place, chromosomes can either become damaged or fused with adjacent chromosomes, leading to cell degradation; since DNA in chromosomes forms instructions, which in turn tell cells how to behave, chromosomes are vital to the correct functioning of the human body. In fact, deoxyribonucleic acid can be found in the nucleus of each living cell; therefore, chromosomes, and the DNA they contain, are passed down from parents to each future generation. In this way, telomeres, given their important protective function for chromosomes, are an essential part of a healthy human body.\n\n(4). The number of individual cells in our bodies does not remain consistent throughout our lives since cells are continually reproducing through the process of copying themselves. This process is necessary to grow new skin, maintain our bones, produce more blood, and generally maintain the state of our bodies. In cell reproduction, DNA molecules are preserved, whereas telomeres become shorter each time the cell is copied; this shortening is mitigated to some extent by the replenishing enzyme telomerase, also known as telomerase reverse transcriptase. However, after an extensive time, the telomeres found on our chromosomes become increasingly shorter.\n\n(5). For the above reason, it has been said that the length of the telomeres found in a person’s cells is a true indicator of their biological age rather than their chronological age. Over our lifetime, repeated copying means that telomeres gradually shorten, and thus become more ineffectual. Telomere shortening is a manifestation of the natural aging process, but telomere shortening can also be a result of lifestyle factors, such as stress, smoking, obesity, and poor diet and exercise habits.\n\n(6). The link between telomere length and cellular aging has been well documented by the scientific community. In total, over 10,000 scientific articles have been published about telomeres. Important discoveries relating to the nature of telomeres and the inability of chromosomes to replicate their ends were made in the 1970s, though scientists at the time were yet to make the connection between telomere shortening and fixed number of cell divisions. It was only later that a private study by the biotechnology company, Geron, clearly showed the connection between telomere shortening and cellular aging.\n\n(7). Since Geron’s discovery, several important scientific studies have been made in the field of telomere research. In 2009, three scientists who established the link between the enzyme telomerase and telomere shortening were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine. The following year, Harvard Medical School released a study demonstrating that telomere shortening was a key cause of aging in cells.\n\n(8). Scientists have found a strong link between many age-related diseases and shortened telomeres. A study conducted by the University of Utah showed that individuals over the age of 60, whose cells contained shorter telomeres, were three times more likely to die of heart disease and eight times more likely to die from infectious disease compared to participants in the same age group with longer telomeres. More specific impacts of telomere shortening documented by scientific studies include a weakened immune system, hardening of the arteries, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and lowered bone density in women. It has also been documented that the rate of telomere shortening is more extreme in men compared to women.\n\n(9). Furthermore, sufferers of the disease, dyskeratosis congenita experience an escalated rate of telomere shortening; documented effects of this disease not only include premature aging and death, but also increased incidence of severe infection, leukemia, intestinal disorder, cirrhosis (destructive scar tissue in the liver), and pulmonary fibrosis (a toughening of lung tissue, which can be fatal). Other symptoms of dyskeratosis congenita are impaired wound healing, bone softening, learning disabilities, as well as factors commonly associated with aging, such as balding or graying of the hair and skin spots. Scientists believe that the previously mentioned disorders, all of which involve tissues within cells that have a higher rate of reproduction, are a result of the presence of shortened telomeres.\n\n(10). Extensive research has been done looking into the connection between telomeres and cancer. Increased cell reproduction is a common feature in many types of cancer; such a heightened rate of cell division results in an escalation of telomere shortening. This phenomenon has been especially observed in pancreatic, bone, prostate, bladder, lung, kidney, and head and neck cancers. In most instances, cells protect themselves by increasing telomerase production, thus keeping the telomeres from reducing. However, in extreme cases, such as escalation of cell reproduction can cause cell death due to the over-shortening of telomeres.\n\n(11). Some researchers propose the use of telomerase as a method of cancer detection, but others go a step further and argue that a potential form of cancer treatment could involve halting the production of telomerase, thus eliminating cancer cells. One study conducted by scientists involved blocking telomerase activity within human breast and prostate cancer cells in the laboratory, which caused the cancer cells to die. However, the risks associated with this type of treatment include reduced fertility, impairment of the natural processes associated with healing wounds in the human body, and loss of blood and immune cell production.\n\n(12). Some researchers have identified longer telomeres and telomerase as indicative of an increased risk of cancer. Conversely, others have argued that increased telomere length may protect against cancer, bearing in mind the link between cancer and shortened telomeres. Scientists continue to conduct studies about telomeres, including the possibilities and potential impacts of halting or reversing the process of telomere shortening. It is possible that temporary activation of telomerase could reverse the shortening of telomeres and slow the aging process in cells. Researchers have proposed drug treatments, gene therapy, and metabolic suppression as methods of reversing telomere shortening - however, these theories have yet to be definitively proven as effectual in humans. Optimistically, scientific studies have demonstrated a link between telomere lengthening and reversal of the signs of aging in species of mice and worms.\n\n(13). One area of science that has sparked interest is studies measuring telomere length; a method for gauging telomere length in cells involves using an oligonucleotide probe and phosphoimager screen or autoradiographic film to determine the length of the telomeres on a chromosome. A second method is called the “Q-FISH methodology,” named so because it employs fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to measure telomere length. However, a large amount of genetic material, up to 20 micrograms, is required to use this method, in addition to intensive labor; for these reasons, it is not a method widely employed in large-scale research. A third technique, called “single telomere elongation length analysis (STELA),” allows researchers to examine specific telomere ends, though this technique is only appropriate for shorter telomeres.\n\n(14). Several scientists have questioned the efficacy of telomere length measurement, and it has been criticized as inappropriate for widespread clinical and personal use. Prominent scientist and Physiology/Medicine Nobel prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn co-founded a company offering clinical telomerase length measuring services, but later resigned, citing concerns over how telomere-related health processes were being controlled and managed. Nonetheless, many laboratories continue to offer telomere length measurement services as a commercial enterprise.\n\n(15). A proposed area for further study and research involves using telomerase to assist with the mass production of so-called “immortal” cells. These cells could be cultured in the lab and transplanted into humans to treat a wide range of diseases. Telomerase is an essential part of this process because it allows scientists to continue to culture and reproduce cells in the lab without such cells breaking down or becoming cancerous due to the over-shortening of their telomeres. Using this process, insulin-producing cells could be engineered in the lab and transplanted to treat patients with diabetes; likewise, doctors could transplant muscle cells to treat those suffering from muscle dystrophy and transplant cartilage cells to treat arthritis. A further use for such lab-engineered cells could be to test new drugs and develop gene therapies."

If we consider that the passage focuses mainly on telomeres, and that telomeres are inside cells, then we can conclude that information such as what determines the biological age of a cell will probably be found early in the passage, as such information could be said to constitute basic knowledge about telomeres. Indeed, the information required to answer the question at hand can be found in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the passage. These paragraphs tell us that telomere length is determined by the number of times cells have divided, which in turn defines a cell’s biological age.

      "text": "(1). Inside the nucleus of cells, our genes are arranged along twisted, double-stranded molecules of DNA called “chromosomes.” At the ends of these chromosomes are stretches of DNA called telomeres, which protect our genetic data, make it possible for cells to divide, and hold some secrets about the processes behind age and cancer; in addition, telomeres are made up of a series of repetitive nucleotide sequences that play an important role in protecting our chromosomes and can also have an impact on aging in cells.\n\n(2).

Optimistically, scientific studies have demonstrated a link between telomere lengthening and reversal of the signs of aging in species of mice and worms.\n\n(13). One area of science that has sparked interest is studies measuring telomere length; a method for gauging telomere length in cells involves using an oligonucleotide probe and phosphoimager screen or autoradiographic film to determine the length of the telomeres on a chromosome. A second method is called the “Q-FISH methodology,” named so because it employs fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to measure telomere length. However, a large amount of genetic material, up to 20 micrograms, is required to use this method, in addition to intensive labor; for these reasons, it is not a method widely employed in large-scale research. A third technique, called “single telomere elongation length analysis (STELA),” allows researchers to examine specific telomere ends, though this technique is only appropriate for shorter telomeres.\n\n(14). Several scientists have questioned the efficacy of telomere length measurement, and it has been criticized as inappropriate for widespread clinical and personal use. Prominent scientist and Physiology/Medicine Nobel prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn co-founded a company offering clinical telomerase length measuring services, but later resigned, citing concerns over how telomere-related health processes were being controlled and managed. Nonetheless, many laboratories continue to offer telomere length measurement services as a commercial enterprise.\n\n(15). A proposed area for further study and research involves using telomerase to assist with the mass production of so-called “immortal” cells. These cells could be cultured in the lab and transplanted into humans to treat a wide range of diseases. Telomerase is an essential part of this process because it allows scientists to continue to culture and reproduce cells in the lab without such cells breaking down or becoming cancerous due to the over-shortening of their telomeres. Using this process, insulin-producing cells could be engineered in the lab and transplanted to treat patients with diabetes; likewise, doctors could transplant muscle cells to treat those suffering from muscle dystrophy and transplant cartilage cells to treat arthritis. A further use for such lab-engineered cells could be to test new drugs and develop gene therapies."

      "title": "Passage 1",
      "text": "(1). Inside the nucleus of cells, our genes are arranged along twisted, double-stranded molecules of DNA called “chromosomes.” At the ends of these chromosomes are stretches of DNA called telomeres, which protect our genetic data, make it possible for cells to divide, and hold some secrets about the processes behind age and cancer; in addition, telomeres are made up of a series of repetitive nucleotide sequences that play an important role in protecting our chromosomes and can also have an impact on aging in cells.\n\n(2). The word “telomere” originates from two Greek words: “telos” meaning end, and “meros” meaning part. The role of telomeres in protecting human DNA was first documented by scientists in the 1930s. One of the most prominent scientists of this era was Barbara McClintock, an American cytogeneticist (a scientist who studies the relationship between chromosomes and cell behavior). After observing how chromosomes stick to their neighbors when their ends are eliminated, in 1933, McClintock determined the existence of a protective tip on the end of chromosomes. Owing to her contributions in the field of cytogenetics, McClintock was the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine.\n\n(3). Without telomeres in place, chromosomes can either become damaged or fused with adjacent chromosomes, leading to cell degradation; since DNA in chromosomes forms instructions, which in turn tell cells how to behave, chromosomes are vital to the correct functioning of the human body. In fact, deoxyribonucleic acid can be found in the nucleus of each living cell; therefore, chromosomes, and the DNA they contain, are passed down from parents to each future generation. In this way, telomeres, given their important protective function for chromosomes, are an essential part of a healthy human body.\n\n(4). The number of individual cells in our bodies does not remain consistent throughout our lives since cells are continually reproducing through the process of copying themselves. This process is necessary to grow new skin, maintain our bones, produce more blood, and generally maintain the state of our bodies. In cell reproduction, DNA molecules are preserved, whereas telomeres become shorter each time the cell is copied; this shortening is mitigated to some extent by the replenishing enzyme telomerase, also known as telomerase reverse transcriptase. However, after an extensive time, the telomeres found on our chromosomes become increasingly shorter.\n\n(5). For the above reason, it has been said that the length of the telomeres found in a person’s cells is a true indicator of their biological age rather than their chronological age. Over our lifetime, repeated copying means that telomeres gradually shorten, and thus become more ineffectual. Telomere shortening is a manifestation of the natural aging process, but telomere shortening can also be a result of lifestyle factors, such as stress, smoking, obesity, and poor diet and exercise habits.\n\n(6). The link between telomere length and cellular aging has been well documented by the scientific community. In total, over 10,000 scientific articles have been published about telomeres. Important discoveries relating to the nature of telomeres and the inability of chromosomes to replicate their ends were made in the 1970s, though scientists at the time were yet to make the connection between telomere shortening and fixed number of cell divisions. It was only later that a private study by the biotechnology company, Geron, clearly showed the connection between telomere shortening and cellular aging.\n\n(7). Since Geron’s discovery, several important scientific studies have been made in the field of telomere research. In 2009, three scientists who established the link between the enzyme telomerase and telomere shortening were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine. The following year, Harvard Medical School released a study demonstrating that telomere shortening was a key cause of aging in cells.\n\n(8). Scientists have found a strong link between many age-related diseases and shortened telomeres. A study conducted by the University of Utah showed that individuals over the age of 60, whose cells contained shorter telomeres, were three times more likely to die of heart disease and eight times more likely to die from infectious disease compared to participants in the same age group with longer telomeres. More specific impacts of telomere shortening documented by scientific studies include a weakened immune system, hardening of the arteries, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and lowered bone density in women. It has also been documented that the rate of telomere shortening is more extreme in men compared to women.\n\n(9). Furthermore, sufferers of the disease, dyskeratosis congenita experience an escalated rate of telomere shortening; documented effects of this disease not only include premature aging and death, but also increased incidence of severe infection, leukemia, intestinal disorder, cirrhosis (destructive scar tissue in the liver), and pulmonary fibrosis (a toughening of lung tissue, which can be fatal). Other symptoms of dyskeratosis congenita are impaired wound healing, bone softening, learning disabilities, as well as factors commonly associated with aging, such as balding or graying of the hair and skin spots. Scientists believe that the previously mentioned disorders, all of which involve tissues within cells that have a higher rate of reproduction, are a result of the presence of shortened telomeres.\n\n(10). Extensive research has been done looking into the connection between telomeres and cancer. Increased cell reproduction is a common feature in many types of cancer; such a heightened rate of cell division results in an escalation of telomere shortening. This phenomenon has been especially observed in pancreatic, bone, prostate, bladder, lung, kidney, and head and neck cancers. In most instances, cells protect themselves by increasing telomerase production, thus keeping the telomeres from reducing. However, in extreme cases, such as escalation of cell reproduction can cause cell death due to the over-shortening of telomeres.\n\n(11). Some researchers propose the use of telomerase as a method of cancer detection, but others go a step further and argue that a potential form of cancer treatment could involve halting the production of telomerase, thus eliminating cancer cells. One study conducted by scientists involved blocking telomerase activity within human breast and prostate cancer cells in the laboratory, which caused the cancer cells to die. However, the risks associated with this type of treatment include reduced fertility, impairment of the natural processes associated with healing wounds in the human body, and loss of blood and immune cell production.\n\n(12). Some researchers have identified longer telomeres and telomerase as indicative of an increased risk of cancer. Conversely, others have argued that increased telomere length may protect against cancer, bearing in mind the link between cancer and shortened telomeres. Scientists continue to conduct studies about telomeres, including the possibilities and potential impacts of halting or reversing the process of telomere shortening. It is possible that temporary activation of telomerase could reverse the shortening of telomeres and slow the aging process in cells. Researchers have proposed drug treatments, gene therapy, and metabolic suppression as methods of reversing telomere shortening - however, these theories have yet to be definitively proven as effectual in humans. Optimistically, scientific studies have demonstrated a link between telomere lengthening and reversal of the signs of aging in species of mice and worms.\n\n(13).

Option D. 2009 – is incorrect because while this may seem correct, the paragraph states: “In 2009, three scientists who established the link between the enzyme telomerase and telomere shortening were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine.” These scientists did not demonstrate the link between telomere shortening and cellular aging, which was done by Harvard Medical School the following year in 2010!",

      "text": "(1). Inside the nucleus of cells, our genes are arranged along twisted, double-stranded molecules of DNA called “chromosomes.” At the ends of these chromosomes are stretches of DNA called telomeres, which protect our genetic data, make it possible for cells to divide, and hold some secrets about the processes behind age and cancer; in addition, telomeres are made up of a series of repetitive nucleotide sequences that play an important role in protecting our chromosomes and can also have an impact on aging in cells.\n\n(2). The word “telomere” originates from two Greek words: “telos” meaning end, and “meros” meaning part. The role of telomeres in protecting human DNA was first documented by scientists in the 1930s. One of the most prominent scientists of this era was Barbara McClintock, an American cytogeneticist (a scientist who studies the relationship between chromosomes and cell behavior). After observing how chromosomes stick to their neighbors when their ends are eliminated, in 1933, McClintock determined the existence of a protective tip on the end of chromosomes. Owing to her contributions in the field of cytogenetics, McClintock was the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine.\n\n(3). Without telomeres in place, chromosomes can either become damaged or fused with adjacent chromosomes, leading to cell degradation; since DNA in chromosomes forms instructions, which in turn tell cells how to behave, chromosomes are vital to the correct functioning of the human body. In fact, deoxyribonucleic acid can be found in the nucleus of each living cell; therefore, chromosomes, and the DNA they contain, are passed down from parents to each future generation. In this way, telomeres, given their important protective function for chromosomes, are an essential part of a healthy human body.\n\n(4). The number of individual cells in our bodies does not remain consistent throughout our lives since cells are continually reproducing through the process of copying themselves. This process is necessary to grow new skin, maintain our bones, produce more blood, and generally maintain the state of our bodies. In cell reproduction, DNA molecules are preserved, whereas telomeres become shorter each time the cell is copied; this shortening is mitigated to some extent by the replenishing enzyme telomerase, also known as telomerase reverse transcriptase. However, after an extensive time, the telomeres found on our chromosomes become increasingly shorter.\n\n(5). For the above reason, it has been said that the length of the telomeres found in a person’s cells is a true indicator of their biological age rather than their chronological age. Over our lifetime, repeated copying means that telomeres gradually shorten, and thus become more ineffectual. Telomere shortening is a manifestation of the natural aging process, but telomere shortening can also be a result of lifestyle factors, such as stress, smoking, obesity, and poor diet and exercise habits.\n\n(6). The link between telomere length and cellular aging has been well documented by the scientific community. In total, over 10,000 scientific articles have been published about telomeres. Important discoveries relating to the nature of telomeres and the inability of chromosomes to replicate their ends were made in the 1970s, though scientists at the time were yet to make the connection between telomere shortening and fixed number of cell divisions. It was only later that a private study by the biotechnology company, Geron, clearly showed the connection between telomere shortening and cellular aging.\n\n(7). Since Geron’s discovery, several important scientific studies have been made in the field of telomere research. In 2009, three scientists who established the link between the enzyme telomerase and telomere shortening were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine. The following year, Harvard Medical School released a study demonstrating that telomere shortening was a key cause of aging in cells.\n\n(8). Scientists have found a strong link between many age-related diseases and shortened telomeres. A study conducted by the University of Utah showed that individuals over the age of 60, whose cells contained shorter telomeres, were three times more likely to die of heart disease and eight times more likely to die from infectious disease compared to participants in the same age group with longer telomeres. More specific impacts of telomere shortening documented by scientific studies include a weakened immune system, hardening of the arteries, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and lowered bone density in women. It has also been documented that the rate of telomere shortening is more extreme in men compared to women.\n\n(9). Furthermore, sufferers of the disease, dyskeratosis congenita experience an escalated rate of telomere shortening; documented effects of this disease not only include premature aging and death, but also increased incidence of severe infection, leukemia, intestinal disorder, cirrhosis (destructive scar tissue in the liver), and pulmonary fibrosis (a toughening of lung tissue, which can be fatal). Other symptoms of dyskeratosis congenita are impaired wound healing, bone softening, learning disabilities, as well as factors commonly associated with aging, such as balding or graying of the hair and skin spots. Scientists believe that the previously mentioned disorders, all of which involve tissues within cells that have a higher rate of reproduction, are a result of the presence of shortened telomeres.\n\n(10). Extensive research has been done looking into the connection between telomeres and cancer. Increased cell reproduction is a common feature in many types of cancer; such a heightened rate of cell division results in an escalation of telomere shortening. This phenomenon has been especially observed in pancreatic, bone, prostate, bladder, lung, kidney, and head and neck cancers. In most instances, cells protect themselves by increasing telomerase production, thus keeping the telomeres from reducing. However, in extreme cases, such as escalation of cell reproduction can cause cell death due to the over-shortening of telomeres.\n\n(11). Some researchers propose the use of telomerase as a method of cancer detection, but others go a step further and argue that a potential form of cancer treatment could involve halting the production of telomerase, thus eliminating cancer cells. One study conducted by scientists involved blocking telomerase activity within human breast and prostate cancer cells in the laboratory, which caused the cancer cells to die. However, the risks associated with this type of treatment include reduced fertility, impairment of the natural processes associated with healing wounds in the human body, and loss of blood and immune cell production.\n\n(12). Some researchers have identified longer telomeres and telomerase as indicative of an increased risk of cancer. Conversely, others have argued that increased telomere length may protect against cancer, bearing in mind the link between cancer and shortened telomeres. Scientists continue to conduct studies about telomeres, including the possibilities and potential impacts of halting or reversing the process of telomere shortening. It is possible that temporary activation of telomerase could reverse the shortening of telomeres and slow the aging process in cells. Researchers have proposed drug treatments, gene therapy, and metabolic suppression as methods of reversing telomere shortening - however, these theories have yet to be definitively proven as effectual in humans. Optimistically, scientific studies have demonstrated a link between telomere lengthening and reversal of the signs of aging in species of mice and worms.\n\n(13). One area of science that has sparked interest is studies measuring telomere length; a method for gauging telomere length in cells involves using an oligonucleotide probe and phosphoimager screen or autoradiographic film to determine the length of the telomeres on a chromosome. A second method is called the “Q-FISH methodology,” named so because it employs fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to measure telomere length. However, a large amount of genetic material, up to 20 micrograms, is required to use this method, in addition to intensive labor; for these reasons, it is not a method widely employed in large-scale research. A third technique, called “single telomere elongation length analysis (STELA),” allows researchers to examine specific telomere ends, though this technique is only appropriate for shorter telomeres.\n\n(14). Several scientists have questioned the efficacy of telomere length measurement, and it has been criticized as inappropriate for widespread clinical and personal use. Prominent scientist and Physiology/Medicine Nobel prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn co-founded a company offering clinical telomerase length measuring services, but later resigned, citing concerns over how telomere-related health processes were being controlled and managed. Nonetheless, many laboratories continue to offer telomere length measurement services as a commercial enterprise.\n\n(15). A proposed area for further study and research involves using telomerase to assist with the mass production of so-called “immortal” cells. These cells could be cultured in the lab and transplanted into humans to treat a wide range of diseases. Telomerase is an essential part of this process because it allows scientists to continue to culture and reproduce cells in the lab without such cells breaking down or becoming cancerous due to the over-shortening of their telomeres. Using this process, insulin-producing cells could be engineered in the lab and transplanted to treat patients with diabetes; likewise, doctors could transplant muscle cells to treat those suffering from muscle dystrophy and transplant cartilage cells to treat arthritis. A further use for such lab-engineered cells could be to test new drugs and develop gene therapies."

Some researchers propose the use of telomerase as a method of cancer detection, but others go a step further and argue that a potential form of cancer treatment could involve halting the production of telomerase, thus eliminating cancer cells. One study conducted by scientists involved blocking telomerase activity within human breast and prostate cancer cells in the laboratory, which caused the cancer cells to die. However, the risks associated with this type of treatment include reduced fertility, impairment of the natural processes associated with healing wounds in the human body, and loss of blood and immune cell production.\n\n(12). Some researchers have identified longer telomeres and telomerase as indicative of an increased risk of cancer. Conversely, others have argued that increased telomere length may protect against cancer, bearing in mind the link between cancer and shortened telomeres. Scientists continue to conduct studies about telomeres, including the possibilities and potential impacts of halting or reversing the process of telomere shortening. It is possible that temporary activation of telomerase could reverse the shortening of telomeres and slow the aging process in cells. Researchers have proposed drug treatments, gene therapy, and metabolic suppression as methods of reversing telomere shortening - however, these theories have yet to be definitively proven as effectual in humans. Optimistically, scientific studies have demonstrated a link between telomere lengthening and reversal of the signs of aging in species of mice and worms.\n\n(13). One area of science that has sparked interest is studies measuring telomere length; a method for gauging telomere length in cells involves using an oligonucleotide probe and phosphoimager screen or autoradiographic film to determine the length of the telomeres on a chromosome. A second method is called the “Q-FISH methodology,” named so because it employs fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to measure telomere length. However, a large amount of genetic material, up to 20 micrograms, is required to use this method, in addition to intensive labor; for these reasons, it is not a method widely employed in large-scale research. A third technique, called “single telomere elongation length analysis (STELA),” allows researchers to examine specific telomere ends, though this technique is only appropriate for shorter telomeres.\n\n(14). Several scientists have questioned the efficacy of telomere length measurement, and it has been criticized as inappropriate for widespread clinical and personal use. Prominent scientist and Physiology/Medicine Nobel prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn co-founded a company offering clinical telomerase length measuring services, but later resigned, citing concerns over how telomere-related health processes were being controlled and managed. Nonetheless, many laboratories continue to offer telomere length measurement services as a commercial enterprise.\n\n(15). A proposed area for further study and research involves using telomerase to assist with the mass production of so-called “immortal” cells. These cells could be cultured in the lab and transplanted into humans to treat a wide range of diseases. Telomerase is an essential part of this process because it allows scientists to continue to culture and reproduce cells in the lab without such cells breaking down or becoming cancerous due to the over-shortening of their telomeres. Using this process, insulin-producing cells could be engineered in the lab and transplanted to treat patients with diabetes; likewise, doctors could transplant muscle cells to treat those suffering from muscle dystrophy and transplant cartilage cells to treat arthritis. A further use for such lab-engineered cells could be to test new drugs and develop gene therapies."

      "text": "(1). Inside the nucleus of cells, our genes are arranged along twisted, double-stranded molecules of DNA called “chromosomes.” At the ends of these chromosomes are stretches of DNA called telomeres, which protect our genetic data, make it possible for cells to divide, and hold some secrets about the processes behind age and cancer; in addition, telomeres are made up of a series of repetitive nucleotide sequences that play an important role in protecting our chromosomes and can also have an impact on aging in cells.\n\n(2). The word “telomere” originates from two Greek words: “telos” meaning end, and “meros” meaning part. The role of telomeres in protecting human DNA was first documented by scientists in the 1930s. One of the most prominent scientists of this era was Barbara McClintock, an American cytogeneticist (a scientist who studies the relationship between chromosomes and cell behavior). After observing how chromosomes stick to their neighbors when their ends are eliminated, in 1933, McClintock determined the existence of a protective tip on the end of chromosomes. Owing to her contributions in the field of cytogenetics, McClintock was the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine.\n\n(3). Without telomeres in place, chromosomes can either become damaged or fused with adjacent chromosomes, leading to cell degradation; since DNA in chromosomes forms instructions, which in turn tell cells how to behave, chromosomes are vital to the correct functioning of the human body. In fact, deoxyribonucleic acid can be found in the nucleus of each living cell; therefore, chromosomes, and the DNA they contain, are passed down from parents to each future generation. In this way, telomeres, given their important protective function for chromosomes, are an essential part of a healthy human body.\n\n(4). The number of individual cells in our bodies does not remain consistent throughout our lives since cells are continually reproducing through the process of copying themselves. This process is necessary to grow new skin, maintain our bones, produce more blood, and generally maintain the state of our bodies. In cell reproduction, DNA molecules are preserved, whereas telomeres become shorter each time the cell is copied; this shortening is mitigated to some extent by the replenishing enzyme telomerase, also known as telomerase reverse transcriptase. However, after an extensive time, the telomeres found on our chromosomes become increasingly shorter.\n\n(5). For the above reason, it has been said that the length of the telomeres found in a person’s cells is a true indicator of their biological age rather than their chronological age. Over our lifetime, repeated copying means that telomeres gradually shorten, and thus become more ineffectual. Telomere shortening is a manifestation of the natural aging process, but telomere shortening can also be a result of lifestyle factors, such as stress, smoking, obesity, and poor diet and exercise habits.\n\n(6). The link between telomere length and cellular aging has been well documented by the scientific community. In total, over 10,000 scientific articles have been published about telomeres. Important discoveries relating to the nature of telomeres and the inability of chromosomes to replicate their ends were made in the 1970s, though scientists at the time were yet to make the connection between telomere shortening and fixed number of cell divisions. It was only later that a private study by the biotechnology company, Geron, clearly showed the connection between telomere shortening and cellular aging.\n\n(7). Since Geron’s discovery, several important scientific studies have been made in the field of telomere research. In 2009, three scientists who established the link between the enzyme telomerase and telomere shortening were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine. The following year, Harvard Medical School released a study demonstrating that telomere shortening was a key cause of aging in cells.\n\n(8). Scientists have found a strong link between many age-related diseases and shortened telomeres. A study conducted by the University of Utah showed that individuals over the age of 60, whose cells contained shorter telomeres, were three times more likely to die of heart disease and eight times more likely to die from infectious disease compared to participants in the same age group with longer telomeres. More specific impacts of telomere shortening documented by scientific studies include a weakened immune system, hardening of the arteries, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and lowered bone density in women. It has also been documented that the rate of telomere shortening is more extreme in men compared to women.\n\n(9). Furthermore, sufferers of the disease, dyskeratosis congenita experience an escalated rate of telomere shortening; documented effects of this disease not only include premature aging and death, but also increased incidence of severe infection, leukemia, intestinal disorder, cirrhosis (destructive scar tissue in the liver), and pulmonary fibrosis (a toughening of lung tissue, which can be fatal). Other symptoms of dyskeratosis congenita are impaired wound healing, bone softening, learning disabilities, as well as factors commonly associated with aging, such as balding or graying of the hair and skin spots. Scientists believe that the previously mentioned disorders, all of which involve tissues within cells that have a higher rate of reproduction, are a result of the presence of shortened telomeres.\n\n(10). Extensive research has been done looking into the connection between telomeres and cancer. Increased cell reproduction is a common feature in many types of cancer; such a heightened rate of cell division results in an escalation of telomere shortening. This phenomenon has been especially observed in pancreatic, bone, prostate, bladder, lung, kidney, and head and neck cancers. In most instances, cells protect themselves by increasing telomerase production, thus keeping the telomeres from reducing. However, in extreme cases, such as escalation of cell reproduction can cause cell death due to the over-shortening of telomeres.\n\n(11). Some researchers propose the use of telomerase as a method of cancer detection, but others go a step further and argue that a potential form of cancer treatment could involve halting the production of telomerase, thus eliminating cancer cells. One study conducted by scientists involved blocking telomerase activity within human breast and prostate cancer cells in the laboratory, which caused the cancer cells to die. However, the risks associated with this type of treatment include reduced fertility, impairment of the natural processes associated with healing wounds in the human body, and loss of blood and immune cell production.\n\n(12). Some researchers have identified longer telomeres and telomerase as indicative of an increased risk of cancer. Conversely, others have argued that increased telomere length may protect against cancer, bearing in mind the link between cancer and shortened telomeres. Scientists continue to conduct studies about telomeres, including the possibilities and potential impacts of halting or reversing the process of telomere shortening. It is possible that temporary activation of telomerase could reverse the shortening of telomeres and slow the aging process in cells. Researchers have proposed drug treatments, gene therapy, and metabolic suppression as methods of reversing telomere shortening - however, these theories have yet to be definitively proven as effectual in humans. Optimistically, scientific studies have demonstrated a link between telomere lengthening and reversal of the signs of aging in species of mice and worms.\n\n(13). One area of science that has sparked interest is studies measuring telomere length; a method for gauging telomere length in cells involves using an oligonucleotide probe and phosphoimager screen or autoradiographic film to determine the length of the telomeres on a chromosome. A second method is called the “Q-FISH methodology,” named so because it employs fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to measure telomere length. However, a large amount of genetic material, up to 20 micrograms, is required to use this method, in addition to intensive labor; for these reasons, it is not a method widely employed in large-scale research.

      "text": "(1). The cognitive processes associated with human vision are incredibly complex; what we call vision, sight, or “visual perception,” is the way in which we take in the information that our eyes receive, process, and interpret it. Such interpretations depend on individual cognitive processes and prior knowledge. The seemingly simple process of reading a passage of text, for instance, is, conversely, incredibly complicated, involving not only multiple subcomponents of vision, but also several distinct brain structures.\n\n(2). The visual system refers to the various components in the body, that work together to achieve visual perception. The process of vision begins when rays of light pass through the pupil of the eye and hit the retina, a light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye, activating receptor cells. This process is facilitated by the cornea - and subsequently the lens of the eye - which focus the light so that it can be received by the retina. The lens can adapt to feedback signals it receives from the brain to adjust its thickness to effectively refract light, so that it is focused onto the retina. It alters its thickness by changing shape to affect its curvature, which in turn adjusts the focal distance of the eye, meaning we can focus our visual perception at a variety of distances, from up close to long range. The human visual system can perceive visible light between 370 and 730 nanometers in wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n(3). The retina is a part of the brain and is designed to be a transducer (a device that converts energy from one form to another) for the conversion of light into neuronal signals. It contains photoreceptive cells, which can detect photons of light and produce neural impulses in response. Through the process of transduction, the retina converts energy from environmental stimuli - in this case light energy - to neural activity, which is a form of activity that the brain can understand and process.\n\n(4). The retina is composed of three different cell layers: a photoreceptor layer, a bipolar cell layer and a ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer is the inner layer, located at the very back of the eye. This layer’s photoreceptive cells can be divided into two types: rod photoreceptors, of which the function is to perceive objects in low light, and cone photoreceptors (responsible for color perception). There are three types of cone receptors: red, green, and blue. Cone photoreceptors contain photopigment molecules that respond to specific wavelengths of light hitting the cone photoreceptors and each wavelength corresponds to the specific color of the photoreceptor cell. When a specific wavelength hits the photoreceptor, the photopigment molecule splits into two; this action causes a message to be sent to the second cell layer of the retina (the bipolar cell layer), which then sends a message to the final layer of cells in the retina, known as the “ganglion layer.”\n\n(5). After the photoreceptor cells in the retina receive light energy and convert it into a neural impulse, the ganglion cells then send messages using the optic nerve, through the optic chiasma and to the brain. Ganglion cells are constantly firing, even when they do not receive stimulus, and the rate of firing increases or decreases depending on the message received from the bipolar cell layer - in this way, information is transmitted to the brain. The optic chiasma is located at the bottom of the brain, directly below the hypothalamus. Here, the optic nerves partially cross, so that the signals received from the right retina are sent to the left hemisphere, and those from the left retina are sent to the right.\n\n(6). Information is then received by the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus in the brain before it is sent to the visual association cortex in the occipital lobe. Following this, the occipital lobe puts together all the sensory information that was perceived by the visual system. In short, the visual association cortex allows us to perceive objects and interpret the entirety of the visual scenes we encounter.\n\n(7). The process of vision involves taking in and assessing a long list of characteristics. For instance, when we look at an object, to determine what we are looking at our brain uses our eyes and optic nerve to process the size of the object, its shape, position, lighting, contrast, color, and dimensions, in addition to whether the object is moving or stationary, how many of the same object are present at a given time, what the object is used for, and its name (all this information is processed within a fraction of a second).\n\n(8). Rather than passively observing information, the brain uses data such as prior knowledge and logic to complete visual pictures; these processes are carried out in specific areas of the occipital lobe, the temporal lobe, and the parietal lobe.\n\n(9). Good vision requires all the areas of the brain involved in visual perception to work together effectively, but there are a range of pathologies and disorders that can impact our visual perception. For example, damage to perceptive organs, such as parts of the eye, the optic nerve, or the parts of the brain involved in vision, can cause partial or total blindness. Glaucoma, diabetes mellitus and brain injury can affect visual perception and are some of the more common causes of blindness.\n\n(10). As vision is a complex process involving multiple areas of the brain, damage to any of these areas can hinder the vision process at its various stages, thus negatively impacting visual perception; such faults in these processes are linked to different disorders. One example is known as Visual Agnosia, which is the inability to recognize previously learned objects, despite the individual with the disorder having functioning sight. There are two types of Visual Agnosia: Perceptive Agnosia and Associative Agnosia.\n\n(11). Sufferers of Perceptive Agnosia can identify the components of an object but cannot interpret the object, while those with Associative Agnosia can process the whole object but cannot understand what it is. Although they do have functional sight, sufferers of Associative Agnosia experience a type of blindness, as they cannot interpret the information that is being received using their eyes.\n\n(12). An individual diagnosed with Perceptive Agnosia finds it challenging to recognize common sights such as body parts, buildings, and animals. Sufferers of the disorder encounter difficulties identifying manipulated items, such as blocks, puzzles, or beads. Those with Perceptive Agnosia cannot draw objects or copy figures. This disorder results from damage to the sections of the brain, including the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, which are responsible for remembrance of crucial everyday items and their purposes. On the other hand, individuals with Associative Agnosia find it difficult to understand the meaning of what they are seeing. Unlike those with Perceptive Agnosia, they can draw a picture, but they cannot identify what they have drawn. They may mistake two objects of similar shape for one another, such as a rowing paddle and a cricket bat. Damage to the inferior occipitotemporal area of the brain, a section responsible for tasks including object recognition and visuospatial processing, causes this disorder.\n\n(13). Additional vision disorders associated with damaged cognitive processes include Akinetopsia (the inability to see movement), Achromatopsia (the inability to see colors), Prosopagnosia (the inability to recognize learned faces) and Alexia (the inability to interpret text). Another common vision disorder is color vision deficiency, affecting approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women in the world. Color vision deficiency, commonly known as color blindness, occurs when photopigment molecules are found in the incorrect photoreceptor cell (for example, if blue photopigments are located inside red cone receptors, the subject will perceive blue objects as red). Each of the mentioned disorders partially or fully impair the ability of an individual to effectively process visual information being received by the brain.\n\n(14). Yet more visual disorders are associated with a disruption of information being received by the brain, disorders which either distort the information received by the brain or eliminate it completely. In some cases, a complete loss of vision may result. It is believed that the reason sufferers of Charles-Bonnet Syndrome, for example, lose the ability to appropriately receive visual information, is due to being without sight for an extended time - without sight, the brain does not receive any visual stimulation. Once a Charles-Bonnet sufferer’s sight is restored, the visual process, having been out of practice, may manifest hallucinations and visual illusions.\n\n(15). Hallucinations caused by distortion of visual information received can also be found in syndromes such as Schizophrenia, but an important difference between sufferers of Schizophrenia and those affected by Charles-Bonnet Syndrome is that the latter can recognize that the hallucinations they are experiencing are not real.\n\n(16). Individuals suffering from Charles-Bonnet syndrome may see less complex visions, like lines, patterns, and mosaics. They may also see more complex images, including people and places. The hallucinations perceived by those with the Charles-Bonnet may be in color or occur in black and white; these images can be still or moving, brief or prolonged, small or large. Charles-Bonnet syndrome is often diagnosed in the elderly as this is the portion of society statistically most likely to encounter issues with their vision. For instance, age-related macular degeneration is one condition in older people that can lead to Charles-Bonnet syndrome. Although sufferers of Charles-Bonnet are aware that their visions are not real, the visions can nonetheless cause distress since individuals may believe they are suffering from a disorder such as dementia. Additionally, the presence of the images may overlay objects in the sufferer’s external world, making it difficult to navigate one’s environment safely.\n\n(17). There is some argument that, as a cognitive ability, our vision can be trained and augmented. Some research companies offer “visual perception training” services, which purportedly allow individuals to maintain or improve the performance of their sight by training the cognitive processes associated with vision to function better.\n\n(18). Mental imagery is an example of a task involving the cognitive processes of visual perception that does not use external stimuli. Humans employ the use of mental imagery in many ways daily; mental imagery is extremely useful in strategic thinking, such as visualizing the potential outcomes of a situation. Mental imagery is also employed in creative processes, where the brain first imagines or visualizes what is to be created. To conduct mental imagery, the brain draws on its prior knowledge of various elements, such as faces, objects and shapes, as well as non-visual sensations such as smell and touch, to create a new image. Creating and forming mental images is also an essential part of dreaming."

The optic chiasma is located at the bottom of the brain, directly below the hypothalamus. Here, the optic nerves partially cross, so that the signals received from the right retina are sent to the left hemisphere, and those from the left retina are sent to the right.\n\n(6). Information is then received by the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus in the brain before it is sent to the visual association cortex in the occipital lobe. Following this, the occipital lobe puts together all the sensory information that was perceived by the visual system. In short, the visual association cortex allows us to perceive objects and interpret the entirety of the visual scenes we encounter.\n\n(7). The process of vision involves taking in and assessing a long list of characteristics. For instance, when we look at an object, to determine what we are looking at our brain uses our eyes and optic nerve to process the size of the object, its shape, position, lighting, contrast, color, and dimensions, in addition to whether the object is moving or stationary, how many of the same object are present at a given time, what the object is used for, and its name (all this information is processed within a fraction of a second).\n\n(8). Rather than passively observing information, the brain uses data such as prior knowledge and logic to complete visual pictures; these processes are carried out in specific areas of the occipital lobe, the temporal lobe, and the parietal lobe.\n\n(9). Good vision requires all the areas of the brain involved in visual perception to work together effectively, but there are a range of pathologies and disorders that can impact our visual perception. For example, damage to perceptive organs, such as parts of the eye, the optic nerve, or the parts of the brain involved in vision, can cause partial or total blindness. Glaucoma, diabetes mellitus and brain injury can affect visual perception and are some of the more common causes of blindness.\n\n(10). As vision is a complex process involving multiple areas of the brain, damage to any of these areas can hinder the vision process at its various stages, thus negatively impacting visual perception; such faults in these processes are linked to different disorders. One example is known as Visual Agnosia, which is the inability to recognize previously learned objects, despite the individual with the disorder having functioning sight. There are two types of Visual Agnosia: Perceptive Agnosia and Associative Agnosia.\n\n(11). Sufferers of Perceptive Agnosia can identify the components of an object but cannot interpret the object, while those with Associative Agnosia can process the whole object but cannot understand what it is. Although they do have functional sight, sufferers of Associative Agnosia experience a type of blindness, as they cannot interpret the information that is being received using their eyes.\n\n(12). An individual diagnosed with Perceptive Agnosia finds it challenging to recognize common sights such as body parts, buildings, and animals. Sufferers of the disorder encounter difficulties identifying manipulated items, such as blocks, puzzles, or beads. Those with Perceptive Agnosia cannot draw objects or copy figures. This disorder results from damage to the sections of the brain, including the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, which are responsible for remembrance of crucial everyday items and their purposes. On the other hand, individuals with Associative Agnosia find it difficult to understand the meaning of what they are seeing. Unlike those with Perceptive Agnosia, they can draw a picture, but they cannot identify what they have drawn. They may mistake two objects of similar shape for one another, such as a rowing paddle and a cricket bat. Damage to the inferior occipitotemporal area of the brain, a section responsible for tasks including object recognition and visuospatial processing, causes this disorder.\n\n(13). Additional vision disorders associated with damaged cognitive processes include Akinetopsia (the inability to see movement), Achromatopsia (the inability to see colors), Prosopagnosia (the inability to recognize learned faces) and Alexia (the inability to interpret text). Another common vision disorder is color vision deficiency, affecting approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women in the world. Color vision deficiency, commonly known as color blindness, occurs when photopigment molecules are found in the incorrect photoreceptor cell (for example, if blue photopigments are located inside red cone receptors, the subject will perceive blue objects as red). Each of the mentioned disorders partially or fully impair the ability of an individual to effectively process visual information being received by the brain.\n\n(14). Yet more visual disorders are associated with a disruption of information being received by the brain, disorders which either distort the information received by the brain or eliminate it completely. In some cases, a complete loss of vision may result. It is believed that the reason sufferers of Charles-Bonnet Syndrome, for example, lose the ability to appropriately receive visual information, is due to being without sight for an extended time - without sight, the brain does not receive any visual stimulation. Once a Charles-Bonnet sufferer’s sight is restored, the visual process, having been out of practice, may manifest hallucinations and visual illusions.\n\n(15). Hallucinations caused by distortion of visual information received can also be found in syndromes such as Schizophrenia, but an important difference between sufferers of Schizophrenia and those affected by Charles-Bonnet Syndrome is that the latter can recognize that the hallucinations they are experiencing are not real.\n\n(16). Individuals suffering from Charles-Bonnet syndrome may see less complex visions, like lines, patterns, and mosaics. They may also see more complex images, including people and places. The hallucinations perceived by those with the Charles-Bonnet may be in color or occur in black and white; these images can be still or moving, brief or prolonged, small or large. Charles-Bonnet syndrome is often diagnosed in the elderly as this is the portion of society statistically most likely to encounter issues with their vision. For instance, age-related macular degeneration is one condition in older people that can lead to Charles-Bonnet syndrome. Although sufferers of Charles-Bonnet are aware that their visions are not real, the visions can nonetheless cause distress since individuals may believe they are suffering from a disorder such as dementia. Additionally, the presence of the images may overlay objects in the sufferer’s external world, making it difficult to navigate one’s environment safely.\n\n(17). There is some argument that, as a cognitive ability, our vision can be trained and augmented. Some research companies offer “visual perception training” services, which purportedly allow individuals to maintain or improve the performance of their sight by training the cognitive processes associated with vision to function better.\n\n(18). Mental imagery is an example of a task involving the cognitive processes of visual perception that does not use external stimuli. Humans employ the use of mental imagery in many ways daily; mental imagery is extremely useful in strategic thinking, such as visualizing the potential outcomes of a situation. Mental imagery is also employed in creative processes, where the brain first imagines or visualizes what is to be created. To conduct mental imagery, the brain draws on its prior knowledge of various elements, such as faces, objects and shapes, as well as non-visual sensations such as smell and touch, to create a new image. Creating and forming mental images is also an essential part of dreaming."

      "text": "(1). The cognitive processes associated with human vision are incredibly complex; what we call vision, sight, or “visual perception,” is the way in which we take in the information that our eyes receive, process, and interpret it. Such interpretations depend on individual cognitive processes and prior knowledge. The seemingly simple process of reading a passage of text, for instance, is, conversely, incredibly complicated, involving not only multiple subcomponents of vision, but also several distinct brain structures.\n\n(2). The visual system refers to the various components in the body, that work together to achieve visual perception. The process of vision begins when rays of light pass through the pupil of the eye and hit the retina, a light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye, activating receptor cells. This process is facilitated by the cornea - and subsequently the lens of the eye - which focus the light so that it can be received by the retina. The lens can adapt to feedback signals it receives from the brain to adjust its thickness to effectively refract light, so that it is focused onto the retina. It alters its thickness by changing shape to affect its curvature, which in turn adjusts the focal distance of the eye, meaning we can focus our visual perception at a variety of distances, from up close to long range. The human visual system can perceive visible light between 370 and 730 nanometers in wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n(3). The retina is a part of the brain and is designed to be a transducer (a device that converts energy from one form to another) for the conversion of light into neuronal signals. It contains photoreceptive cells, which can detect photons of light and produce neural impulses in response. Through the process of transduction, the retina converts energy from environmental stimuli - in this case light energy - to neural activity, which is a form of activity that the brain can understand and process.\n\n(4). The retina is composed of three different cell layers: a photoreceptor layer, a bipolar cell layer and a ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer is the inner layer, located at the very back of the eye. This layer’s photoreceptive cells can be divided into two types: rod photoreceptors, of which the function is to perceive objects in low light, and cone photoreceptors (responsible for color perception). There are three types of cone receptors: red, green, and blue. Cone photoreceptors contain photopigment molecules that respond to specific wavelengths of light hitting the cone photoreceptors and each wavelength corresponds to the specific color of the photoreceptor cell. When a specific wavelength hits the photoreceptor, the photopigment molecule splits into two; this action causes a message to be sent to the second cell layer of the retina (the bipolar cell layer), which then sends a message to the final layer of cells in the retina, known as the “ganglion layer.”\n\n(5). After the photoreceptor cells in the retina receive light energy and convert it into a neural impulse, the ganglion cells then send messages using the optic nerve, through the optic chiasma and to the brain. Ganglion cells are constantly firing, even when they do not receive stimulus, and the rate of firing increases or decreases depending on the message received from the bipolar cell layer - in this way, information is transmitted to the brain.

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should first locate the paragraph in the passage that discusses vision training; this can be found in the fifteenth paragraph. Paragraph 15 reads: “There is some argument that, as a cognitive ability, our vision can be trained and augmented. Some research companies offer “visual perception training” services, which purportedly allow individuals to maintain or improve the performance of their sight by training the cognitive processes associated with vision to function better.” Next, we should pay close attention to the author’s wording in this paragraph to ascertain their attitude and match it to one of the descriptors in the answer choices. If we note that the author uses language such as “there is some argument” and “purportedly,” we can deduce that the author is skeptical about vision training. Thus, the author’s attitude towards training our abilities in visual perception is skeptical. Therefore, Option E is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Cynical – is incorrect because, when the author mentions vision training in paragraph 15, they do not seem distrustful of the information they are presenting. Therefore, since the word cynical does not best describe the author’s attitude, it is incorrect. Option B. Indifferent – is incorrect because, while this may seem correct, having an indifferent attitude means having no particular interest in a subject matter. The first piece of evidence against the claim that the author is indifferent towards vision training is the fact that they chose to mention it at all in the passage; if they mentioned it, they wish to comment on it and are thus not indifferent. Secondly, the author uses skeptical language when they comment that visual training services falsely purport to improve vision; once again, this shows that the author has an opinion and is thus not indifferent. Option C. Critical – is incorrect because a critical attitude would mean that the author of the passage disapproves of vision training, and this does not seem to be the case – paragraph 15 demonstrates that the author seems more in doubt about the effectiveness of this training but does not necessarily disapprove of its use. Option D. Solemn – is incorrect because solemn means conveying a serious attitude when discussing a subject. This is not the case here, as, based on paragraph 15, the author casts doubt on the effectiveness of vision treatment but does not engage in a serious discussion of its pros and cons.",

Each of the mentioned disorders partially or fully impair the ability of an individual to effectively process visual information being received by the brain.\n\n(14). Yet more visual disorders are associated with a disruption of information being received by the brain, disorders which either distort the information received by the brain or eliminate it completely. In some cases, a complete loss of vision may result. It is believed that the reason sufferers of Charles-Bonnet Syndrome, for example, lose the ability to appropriately receive visual information, is due to being without sight for an extended time - without sight, the brain does not receive any visual stimulation. Once a Charles-Bonnet sufferer’s sight is restored, the visual process, having been out of practice, may manifest hallucinations and visual illusions.\n\n(15). Hallucinations caused by distortion of visual information received can also be found in syndromes such as Schizophrenia, but an important difference between sufferers of Schizophrenia and those affected by Charles-Bonnet Syndrome is that the latter can recognize that the hallucinations they are experiencing are not real.\n\n(16). Individuals suffering from Charles-Bonnet syndrome may see less complex visions, like lines, patterns, and mosaics. They may also see more complex images, including people and places. The hallucinations perceived by those with the Charles-Bonnet may be in color or occur in black and white; these images can be still or moving, brief or prolonged, small or large. Charles-Bonnet syndrome is often diagnosed in the elderly as this is the portion of society statistically most likely to encounter issues with their vision. For instance, age-related macular degeneration is one condition in older people that can lead to Charles-Bonnet syndrome. Although sufferers of Charles-Bonnet are aware that their visions are not real, the visions can nonetheless cause distress since individuals may believe they are suffering from a disorder such as dementia. Additionally, the presence of the images may overlay objects in the sufferer’s external world, making it difficult to navigate one’s environment safely.\n\n(17). There is some argument that, as a cognitive ability, our vision can be trained and augmented. Some research companies offer “visual perception training” services, which purportedly allow individuals to maintain or improve the performance of their sight by training the cognitive processes associated with vision to function better.\n\n(18). Mental imagery is an example of a task involving the cognitive processes of visual perception that does not use external stimuli. Humans employ the use of mental imagery in many ways daily; mental imagery is extremely useful in strategic thinking, such as visualizing the potential outcomes of a situation. Mental imagery is also employed in creative processes, where the brain first imagines or visualizes what is to be created. To conduct mental imagery, the brain draws on its prior knowledge of various elements, such as faces, objects and shapes, as well as non-visual sensations such as smell and touch, to create a new image. Creating and forming mental images is also an essential part of dreaming."

      "text": "(1). The cognitive processes associated with human vision are incredibly complex; what we call vision, sight, or “visual perception,” is the way in which we take in the information that our eyes receive, process, and interpret it. Such interpretations depend on individual cognitive processes and prior knowledge. The seemingly simple process of reading a passage of text, for instance, is, conversely, incredibly complicated, involving not only multiple subcomponents of vision, but also several distinct brain structures.\n\n(2). The visual system refers to the various components in the body, that work together to achieve visual perception. The process of vision begins when rays of light pass through the pupil of the eye and hit the retina, a light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye, activating receptor cells. This process is facilitated by the cornea - and subsequently the lens of the eye - which focus the light so that it can be received by the retina. The lens can adapt to feedback signals it receives from the brain to adjust its thickness to effectively refract light, so that it is focused onto the retina. It alters its thickness by changing shape to affect its curvature, which in turn adjusts the focal distance of the eye, meaning we can focus our visual perception at a variety of distances, from up close to long range. The human visual system can perceive visible light between 370 and 730 nanometers in wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n(3). The retina is a part of the brain and is designed to be a transducer (a device that converts energy from one form to another) for the conversion of light into neuronal signals. It contains photoreceptive cells, which can detect photons of light and produce neural impulses in response. Through the process of transduction, the retina converts energy from environmental stimuli - in this case light energy - to neural activity, which is a form of activity that the brain can understand and process.\n\n(4). The retina is composed of three different cell layers: a photoreceptor layer, a bipolar cell layer and a ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer is the inner layer, located at the very back of the eye. This layer’s photoreceptive cells can be divided into two types: rod photoreceptors, of which the function is to perceive objects in low light, and cone photoreceptors (responsible for color perception). There are three types of cone receptors: red, green, and blue. Cone photoreceptors contain photopigment molecules that respond to specific wavelengths of light hitting the cone photoreceptors and each wavelength corresponds to the specific color of the photoreceptor cell. When a specific wavelength hits the photoreceptor, the photopigment molecule splits into two; this action causes a message to be sent to the second cell layer of the retina (the bipolar cell layer), which then sends a message to the final layer of cells in the retina, known as the “ganglion layer.”\n\n(5). After the photoreceptor cells in the retina receive light energy and convert it into a neural impulse, the ganglion cells then send messages using the optic nerve, through the optic chiasma and to the brain. Ganglion cells are constantly firing, even when they do not receive stimulus, and the rate of firing increases or decreases depending on the message received from the bipolar cell layer - in this way, information is transmitted to the brain. The optic chiasma is located at the bottom of the brain, directly below the hypothalamus. Here, the optic nerves partially cross, so that the signals received from the right retina are sent to the left hemisphere, and those from the left retina are sent to the right.\n\n(6). Information is then received by the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus in the brain before it is sent to the visual association cortex in the occipital lobe. Following this, the occipital lobe puts together all the sensory information that was perceived by the visual system. In short, the visual association cortex allows us to perceive objects and interpret the entirety of the visual scenes we encounter.\n\n(7). The process of vision involves taking in and assessing a long list of characteristics. For instance, when we look at an object, to determine what we are looking at our brain uses our eyes and optic nerve to process the size of the object, its shape, position, lighting, contrast, color, and dimensions, in addition to whether the object is moving or stationary, how many of the same object are present at a given time, what the object is used for, and its name (all this information is processed within a fraction of a second).\n\n(8). Rather than passively observing information, the brain uses data such as prior knowledge and logic to complete visual pictures; these processes are carried out in specific areas of the occipital lobe, the temporal lobe, and the parietal lobe.\n\n(9). Good vision requires all the areas of the brain involved in visual perception to work together effectively, but there are a range of pathologies and disorders that can impact our visual perception. For example, damage to perceptive organs, such as parts of the eye, the optic nerve, or the parts of the brain involved in vision, can cause partial or total blindness. Glaucoma, diabetes mellitus and brain injury can affect visual perception and are some of the more common causes of blindness.\n\n(10). As vision is a complex process involving multiple areas of the brain, damage to any of these areas can hinder the vision process at its various stages, thus negatively impacting visual perception; such faults in these processes are linked to different disorders. One example is known as Visual Agnosia, which is the inability to recognize previously learned objects, despite the individual with the disorder having functioning sight. There are two types of Visual Agnosia: Perceptive Agnosia and Associative Agnosia.\n\n(11). Sufferers of Perceptive Agnosia can identify the components of an object but cannot interpret the object, while those with Associative Agnosia can process the whole object but cannot understand what it is. Although they do have functional sight, sufferers of Associative Agnosia experience a type of blindness, as they cannot interpret the information that is being received using their eyes.\n\n(12). An individual diagnosed with Perceptive Agnosia finds it challenging to recognize common sights such as body parts, buildings, and animals. Sufferers of the disorder encounter difficulties identifying manipulated items, such as blocks, puzzles, or beads. Those with Perceptive Agnosia cannot draw objects or copy figures. This disorder results from damage to the sections of the brain, including the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, which are responsible for remembrance of crucial everyday items and their purposes. On the other hand, individuals with Associative Agnosia find it difficult to understand the meaning of what they are seeing. Unlike those with Perceptive Agnosia, they can draw a picture, but they cannot identify what they have drawn. They may mistake two objects of similar shape for one another, such as a rowing paddle and a cricket bat. Damage to the inferior occipitotemporal area of the brain, a section responsible for tasks including object recognition and visuospatial processing, causes this disorder.\n\n(13). Additional vision disorders associated with damaged cognitive processes include Akinetopsia (the inability to see movement), Achromatopsia (the inability to see colors), Prosopagnosia (the inability to recognize learned faces) and Alexia (the inability to interpret text). Another common vision disorder is color vision deficiency, affecting approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women in the world. Color vision deficiency, commonly known as color blindness, occurs when photopigment molecules are found in the incorrect photoreceptor cell (for example, if blue photopigments are located inside red cone receptors, the subject will perceive blue objects as red).

Schizophrenia and associative agnosia – is incorrect because associative agnosia patients have functional sight but cannot interpret the information being received. These patients can see objects entirely but cannot recognize these objects. Based on the question stem, the woman can only recognize parts of visuals, not the whole visuals - thus, she more likely has perceptive agnosia. Option D.

      "text": "(1). The cognitive processes associated with human vision are incredibly complex; what we call vision, sight, or “visual perception,” is the way in which we take in the information that our eyes receive, process, and interpret it. Such interpretations depend on individual cognitive processes and prior knowledge. The seemingly simple process of reading a passage of text, for instance, is, conversely, incredibly complicated, involving not only multiple subcomponents of vision, but also several distinct brain structures.\n\n(2). The visual system refers to the various components in the body, that work together to achieve visual perception. The process of vision begins when rays of light pass through the pupil of the eye and hit the retina, a light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye, activating receptor cells. This process is facilitated by the cornea - and subsequently the lens of the eye - which focus the light so that it can be received by the retina. The lens can adapt to feedback signals it receives from the brain to adjust its thickness to effectively refract light, so that it is focused onto the retina. It alters its thickness by changing shape to affect its curvature, which in turn adjusts the focal distance of the eye, meaning we can focus our visual perception at a variety of distances, from up close to long range. The human visual system can perceive visible light between 370 and 730 nanometers in wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n(3). The retina is a part of the brain and is designed to be a transducer (a device that converts energy from one form to another) for the conversion of light into neuronal signals. It contains photoreceptive cells, which can detect photons of light and produce neural impulses in response. Through the process of transduction, the retina converts energy from environmental stimuli - in this case light energy - to neural activity, which is a form of activity that the brain can understand and process.\n\n(4). The retina is composed of three different cell layers: a photoreceptor layer, a bipolar cell layer and a ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer is the inner layer, located at the very back of the eye. This layer’s photoreceptive cells can be divided into two types: rod photoreceptors, of which the function is to perceive objects in low light, and cone photoreceptors (responsible for color perception). There are three types of cone receptors: red, green, and blue. Cone photoreceptors contain photopigment molecules that respond to specific wavelengths of light hitting the cone photoreceptors and each wavelength corresponds to the specific color of the photoreceptor cell. When a specific wavelength hits the photoreceptor, the photopigment molecule splits into two; this action causes a message to be sent to the second cell layer of the retina (the bipolar cell layer), which then sends a message to the final layer of cells in the retina, known as the “ganglion layer.”\n\n(5). After the photoreceptor cells in the retina receive light energy and convert it into a neural impulse, the ganglion cells then send messages using the optic nerve, through the optic chiasma and to the brain. Ganglion cells are constantly firing, even when they do not receive stimulus, and the rate of firing increases or decreases depending on the message received from the bipolar cell layer - in this way, information is transmitted to the brain. The optic chiasma is located at the bottom of the brain, directly below the hypothalamus. Here, the optic nerves partially cross, so that the signals received from the right retina are sent to the left hemisphere, and those from the left retina are sent to the right.\n\n(6). Information is then received by the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus in the brain before it is sent to the visual association cortex in the occipital lobe. Following this, the occipital lobe puts together all the sensory information that was perceived by the visual system. In short, the visual association cortex allows us to perceive objects and interpret the entirety of the visual scenes we encounter.\n\n(7). The process of vision involves taking in and assessing a long list of characteristics. For instance, when we look at an object, to determine what we are looking at our brain uses our eyes and optic nerve to process the size of the object, its shape, position, lighting, contrast, color, and dimensions, in addition to whether the object is moving or stationary, how many of the same object are present at a given time, what the object is used for, and its name (all this information is processed within a fraction of a second).\n\n(8). Rather than passively observing information, the brain uses data such as prior knowledge and logic to complete visual pictures; these processes are carried out in specific areas of the occipital lobe, the temporal lobe, and the parietal lobe.\n\n(9). Good vision requires all the areas of the brain involved in visual perception to work together effectively, but there are a range of pathologies and disorders that can impact our visual perception. For example, damage to perceptive organs, such as parts of the eye, the optic nerve, or the parts of the brain involved in vision, can cause partial or total blindness. Glaucoma, diabetes mellitus and brain injury can affect visual perception and are some of the more common causes of blindness.\n\n(10). As vision is a complex process involving multiple areas of the brain, damage to any of these areas can hinder the vision process at its various stages, thus negatively impacting visual perception; such faults in these processes are linked to different disorders. One example is known as Visual Agnosia, which is the inability to recognize previously learned objects, despite the individual with the disorder having functioning sight. There are two types of Visual Agnosia: Perceptive Agnosia and Associative Agnosia.\n\n(11). Sufferers of Perceptive Agnosia can identify the components of an object but cannot interpret the object, while those with Associative Agnosia can process the whole object but cannot understand what it is. Although they do have functional sight, sufferers of Associative Agnosia experience a type of blindness, as they cannot interpret the information that is being received using their eyes.\n\n(12). An individual diagnosed with Perceptive Agnosia finds it challenging to recognize common sights such as body parts, buildings, and animals. Sufferers of the disorder encounter difficulties identifying manipulated items, such as blocks, puzzles, or beads. Those with Perceptive Agnosia cannot draw objects or copy figures. This disorder results from damage to the sections of the brain, including the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, which are responsible for remembrance of crucial everyday items and their purposes. On the other hand, individuals with Associative Agnosia find it difficult to understand the meaning of what they are seeing. Unlike those with Perceptive Agnosia, they can draw a picture, but they cannot identify what they have drawn. They may mistake two objects of similar shape for one another, such as a rowing paddle and a cricket bat. Damage to the inferior occipitotemporal area of the brain, a section responsible for tasks including object recognition and visuospatial processing, causes this disorder.\n\n(13). Additional vision disorders associated with damaged cognitive processes include Akinetopsia (the inability to see movement), Achromatopsia (the inability to see colors), Prosopagnosia (the inability to recognize learned faces) and Alexia (the inability to interpret text). Another common vision disorder is color vision deficiency, affecting approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women in the world. Color vision deficiency, commonly known as color blindness, occurs when photopigment molecules are found in the incorrect photoreceptor cell (for example, if blue photopigments are located inside red cone receptors, the subject will perceive blue objects as red). Each of the mentioned disorders partially or fully impair the ability of an individual to effectively process visual information being received by the brain.\n\n(14). Yet more visual disorders are associated with a disruption of information being received by the brain, disorders which either distort the information received by the brain or eliminate it completely. In some cases, a complete loss of vision may result. It is believed that the reason sufferers of Charles-Bonnet Syndrome, for example, lose the ability to appropriately receive visual information, is due to being without sight for an extended time - without sight, the brain does not receive any visual stimulation. Once a Charles-Bonnet sufferer’s sight is restored, the visual process, having been out of practice, may manifest hallucinations and visual illusions.\n\n(15). Hallucinations caused by distortion of visual information received can also be found in syndromes such as Schizophrenia, but an important difference between sufferers of Schizophrenia and those affected by Charles-Bonnet Syndrome is that the latter can recognize that the hallucinations they are experiencing are not real.\n\n(16). Individuals suffering from Charles-Bonnet syndrome may see less complex visions, like lines, patterns, and mosaics. They may also see more complex images, including people and places. The hallucinations perceived by those with the Charles-Bonnet may be in color or occur in black and white; these images can be still or moving, brief or prolonged, small or large. Charles-Bonnet syndrome is often diagnosed in the elderly as this is the portion of society statistically most likely to encounter issues with their vision. For instance, age-related macular degeneration is one condition in older people that can lead to Charles-Bonnet syndrome. Although sufferers of Charles-Bonnet are aware that their visions are not real, the visions can nonetheless cause distress since individuals may believe they are suffering from a disorder such as dementia. Additionally, the presence of the images may overlay objects in the sufferer’s external world, making it difficult to navigate one’s environment safely.\n\n(17). There is some argument that, as a cognitive ability, our vision can be trained and augmented. Some research companies offer “visual perception training” services, which purportedly allow individuals to maintain or improve the performance of their sight by training the cognitive processes associated with vision to function better.\n\n(18). Mental imagery is an example of a task involving the cognitive processes of visual perception that does not use external stimuli. Humans employ the use of mental imagery in many ways daily; mental imagery is extremely useful in strategic thinking, such as visualizing the potential outcomes of a situation. Mental imagery is also employed in creative processes, where the brain first imagines or visualizes what is to be created. To conduct mental imagery, the brain draws on its prior knowledge of various elements, such as faces, objects and shapes, as well as non-visual sensations such as smell and touch, to create a new image. Creating and forming mental images is also an essential part of dreaming."

      "text": "(1). The cognitive processes associated with human vision are incredibly complex; what we call vision, sight, or “visual perception,” is the way in which we take in the information that our eyes receive, process, and interpret it. Such interpretations depend on individual cognitive processes and prior knowledge. The seemingly simple process of reading a passage of text, for instance, is, conversely, incredibly complicated, involving not only multiple subcomponents of vision, but also several distinct brain structures.\n\n(2). The visual system refers to the various components in the body, that work together to achieve visual perception. The process of vision begins when rays of light pass through the pupil of the eye and hit the retina, a light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye, activating receptor cells. This process is facilitated by the cornea - and subsequently the lens of the eye - which focus the light so that it can be received by the retina. The lens can adapt to feedback signals it receives from the brain to adjust its thickness to effectively refract light, so that it is focused onto the retina. It alters its thickness by changing shape to affect its curvature, which in turn adjusts the focal distance of the eye, meaning we can focus our visual perception at a variety of distances, from up close to long range. The human visual system can perceive visible light between 370 and 730 nanometers in wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n(3). The retina is a part of the brain and is designed to be a transducer (a device that converts energy from one form to another) for the conversion of light into neuronal signals. It contains photoreceptive cells, which can detect photons of light and produce neural impulses in response. Through the process of transduction, the retina converts energy from environmental stimuli - in this case light energy - to neural activity, which is a form of activity that the brain can understand and process.\n\n(4). The retina is composed of three different cell layers: a photoreceptor layer, a bipolar cell layer and a ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer is the inner layer, located at the very back of the eye. This layer’s photoreceptive cells can be divided into two types: rod photoreceptors, of which the function is to perceive objects in low light, and cone photoreceptors (responsible for color perception). There are three types of cone receptors: red, green, and blue. Cone photoreceptors contain photopigment molecules that respond to specific wavelengths of light hitting the cone photoreceptors and each wavelength corresponds to the specific color of the photoreceptor cell. When a specific wavelength hits the photoreceptor, the photopigment molecule splits into two; this action causes a message to be sent to the second cell layer of the retina (the bipolar cell layer), which then sends a message to the final layer of cells in the retina, known as the “ganglion layer.”\n\n(5). After the photoreceptor cells in the retina receive light energy and convert it into a neural impulse, the ganglion cells then send messages using the optic nerve, through the optic chiasma and to the brain. Ganglion cells are constantly firing, even when they do not receive stimulus, and the rate of firing increases or decreases depending on the message received from the bipolar cell layer - in this way, information is transmitted to the brain. The optic chiasma is located at the bottom of the brain, directly below the hypothalamus. Here, the optic nerves partially cross, so that the signals received from the right retina are sent to the left hemisphere, and those from the left retina are sent to the right.\n\n(6). Information is then received by the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus in the brain before it is sent to the visual association cortex in the occipital lobe. Following this, the occipital lobe puts together all the sensory information that was perceived by the visual system. In short, the visual association cortex allows us to perceive objects and interpret the entirety of the visual scenes we encounter.\n\n(7). The process of vision involves taking in and assessing a long list of characteristics. For instance, when we look at an object, to determine what we are looking at our brain uses our eyes and optic nerve to process the size of the object, its shape, position, lighting, contrast, color, and dimensions, in addition to whether the object is moving or stationary, how many of the same object are present at a given time, what the object is used for, and its name (all this information is processed within a fraction of a second).\n\n(8). Rather than passively observing information, the brain uses data such as prior knowledge and logic to complete visual pictures; these processes are carried out in specific areas of the occipital lobe, the temporal lobe, and the parietal lobe.\n\n(9). Good vision requires all the areas of the brain involved in visual perception to work together effectively, but there are a range of pathologies and disorders that can impact our visual perception. For example, damage to perceptive organs, such as parts of the eye, the optic nerve, or the parts of the brain involved in vision, can cause partial or total blindness. Glaucoma, diabetes mellitus and brain injury can affect visual perception and are some of the more common causes of blindness.\n\n(10). As vision is a complex process involving multiple areas of the brain, damage to any of these areas can hinder the vision process at its various stages, thus negatively impacting visual perception; such faults in these processes are linked to different disorders. One example is known as Visual Agnosia, which is the inability to recognize previously learned objects, despite the individual with the disorder having functioning sight. There are two types of Visual Agnosia: Perceptive Agnosia and Associative Agnosia.\n\n(11). Sufferers of Perceptive Agnosia can identify the components of an object but cannot interpret the object, while those with Associative Agnosia can process the whole object but cannot understand what it is. Although they do have functional sight, sufferers of Associative Agnosia experience a type of blindness, as they cannot interpret the information that is being received using their eyes.\n\n(12). An individual diagnosed with Perceptive Agnosia finds it challenging to recognize common sights such as body parts, buildings, and animals. Sufferers of the disorder encounter difficulties identifying manipulated items, such as blocks, puzzles, or beads. Those with Perceptive Agnosia cannot draw objects or copy figures. This disorder results from damage to the sections of the brain, including the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, which are responsible for remembrance of crucial everyday items and their purposes. On the other hand, individuals with Associative Agnosia find it difficult to understand the meaning of what they are seeing. Unlike those with Perceptive Agnosia, they can draw a picture, but they cannot identify what they have drawn. They may mistake two objects of similar shape for one another, such as a rowing paddle and a cricket bat. Damage to the inferior occipitotemporal area of the brain, a section responsible for tasks including object recognition and visuospatial processing, causes this disorder.\n\n(13). Additional vision disorders associated with damaged cognitive processes include Akinetopsia (the inability to see movement), Achromatopsia (the inability to see colors), Prosopagnosia (the inability to recognize learned faces) and Alexia (the inability to interpret text). Another common vision disorder is color vision deficiency, affecting approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women in the world. Color vision deficiency, commonly known as color blindness, occurs when photopigment molecules are found in the incorrect photoreceptor cell (for example, if blue photopigments are located inside red cone receptors, the subject will perceive blue objects as red). Each of the mentioned disorders partially or fully impair the ability of an individual to effectively process visual information being received by the brain.\n\n(14). Yet more visual disorders are associated with a disruption of information being received by the brain, disorders which either distort the information received by the brain or eliminate it completely. In some cases, a complete loss of vision may result. It is believed that the reason sufferers of Charles-Bonnet Syndrome, for example, lose the ability to appropriately receive visual information, is due to being without sight for an extended time - without sight, the brain does not receive any visual stimulation. Once a Charles-Bonnet sufferer’s sight is restored, the visual process, having been out of practice, may manifest hallucinations and visual illusions.\n\n(15). Hallucinations caused by distortion of visual information received can also be found in syndromes such as Schizophrenia, but an important difference between sufferers of Schizophrenia and those affected by Charles-Bonnet Syndrome is that the latter can recognize that the hallucinations they are experiencing are not real.\n\n(16). Individuals suffering from Charles-Bonnet syndrome may see less complex visions, like lines, patterns, and mosaics. They may also see more complex images, including people and places. The hallucinations perceived by those with the Charles-Bonnet may be in color or occur in black and white; these images can be still or moving, brief or prolonged, small or large. Charles-Bonnet syndrome is often diagnosed in the elderly as this is the portion of society statistically most likely to encounter issues with their vision. For instance, age-related macular degeneration is one condition in older people that can lead to Charles-Bonnet syndrome. Although sufferers of Charles-Bonnet are aware that their visions are not real, the visions can nonetheless cause distress since individuals may believe they are suffering from a disorder such as dementia. Additionally, the presence of the images may overlay objects in the sufferer’s external world, making it difficult to navigate one’s environment safely.\n\n(17). There is some argument that, as a cognitive ability, our vision can be trained and augmented. Some research companies offer “visual perception training” services, which purportedly allow individuals to maintain or improve the performance of their sight by training the cognitive processes associated with vision to function better.\n\n(18). Mental imagery is an example of a task involving the cognitive processes of visual perception that does not use external stimuli. Humans employ the use of mental imagery in many ways daily; mental imagery is extremely useful in strategic thinking, such as visualizing the potential outcomes of a situation. Mental imagery is also employed in creative processes, where the brain first imagines or visualizes what is to be created. To conduct mental imagery, the brain draws on its prior knowledge of various elements, such as faces, objects and shapes, as well as non-visual sensations such as smell and touch, to create a new image. Creating and forming mental images is also an essential part of dreaming."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, consider that it states that an individual lost the ability to recognize faces after an accident; therefore, we should scan the passage for all mention of vision disorders and match the symptoms of the accident victim in the question to one of these disorders. Vision disorders and conditions are discussed in paragraphs 9–16. In paragraph 13, the author mentions the statement below. This tells us that Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize faces, which is caused by damaged cognitive processes impairing the ability of an individual to effectively process visual information being received. “Additional vision disorders associated with damaged cognitive processes include Akinetopsia (the inability to see movement), Achromatopsia (the inability to see colors), Prosopagnosia (the inability to recognize learned faces) and Alexia (the inability to interpret text)…each of the mentioned disorders partially or fully impair the ability of an individual to effectively process visual information being received by the brain.” Thus, the individual in the question stem likely has prosopagnosia, a condition caused by an impaired ability to process visual information being received. Therefore, Option E is the correct answer.",

Ganglion cells are constantly firing, even when they do not receive stimulus, and the rate of firing increases or decreases depending on the message received from the bipolar cell layer - in this way, information is transmitted to the brain. The optic chiasma is located at the bottom of the brain, directly below the hypothalamus. Here, the optic nerves partially cross, so that the signals received from the right retina are sent to the left hemisphere, and those from the left retina are sent to the right.\n\n(6). Information is then received by the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus in the brain before it is sent to the visual association cortex in the occipital lobe. Following this, the occipital lobe puts together all the sensory information that was perceived by the visual system. In short, the visual association cortex allows us to perceive objects and interpret the entirety of the visual scenes we encounter.\n\n(7). The process of vision involves taking in and assessing a long list of characteristics. For instance, when we look at an object, to determine what we are looking at our brain uses our eyes and optic nerve to process the size of the object, its shape, position, lighting, contrast, color, and dimensions, in addition to whether the object is moving or stationary, how many of the same object are present at a given time, what the object is used for, and its name (all this information is processed within a fraction of a second).\n\n(8). Rather than passively observing information, the brain uses data such as prior knowledge and logic to complete visual pictures; these processes are carried out in specific areas of the occipital lobe, the temporal lobe, and the parietal lobe.\n\n(9). Good vision requires all the areas of the brain involved in visual perception to work together effectively, but there are a range of pathologies and disorders that can impact our visual perception. For example, damage to perceptive organs, such as parts of the eye, the optic nerve, or the parts of the brain involved in vision, can cause partial or total blindness. Glaucoma, diabetes mellitus and brain injury can affect visual perception and are some of the more common causes of blindness.\n\n(10). As vision is a complex process involving multiple areas of the brain, damage to any of these areas can hinder the vision process at its various stages, thus negatively impacting visual perception; such faults in these processes are linked to different disorders. One example is known as Visual Agnosia, which is the inability to recognize previously learned objects, despite the individual with the disorder having functioning sight. There are two types of Visual Agnosia: Perceptive Agnosia and Associative Agnosia.\n\n(11). Sufferers of Perceptive Agnosia can identify the components of an object but cannot interpret the object, while those with Associative Agnosia can process the whole object but cannot understand what it is. Although they do have functional sight, sufferers of Associative Agnosia experience a type of blindness, as they cannot interpret the information that is being received using their eyes.\n\n(12). An individual diagnosed with Perceptive Agnosia finds it challenging to recognize common sights such as body parts, buildings, and animals. Sufferers of the disorder encounter difficulties identifying manipulated items, such as blocks, puzzles, or beads. Those with Perceptive Agnosia cannot draw objects or copy figures. This disorder results from damage to the sections of the brain, including the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, which are responsible for remembrance of crucial everyday items and their purposes. On the other hand, individuals with Associative Agnosia find it difficult to understand the meaning of what they are seeing. Unlike those with Perceptive Agnosia, they can draw a picture, but they cannot identify what they have drawn. They may mistake two objects of similar shape for one another, such as a rowing paddle and a cricket bat. Damage to the inferior occipitotemporal area of the brain, a section responsible for tasks including object recognition and visuospatial processing, causes this disorder.\n\n(13). Additional vision disorders associated with damaged cognitive processes include Akinetopsia (the inability to see movement), Achromatopsia (the inability to see colors), Prosopagnosia (the inability to recognize learned faces) and Alexia (the inability to interpret text). Another common vision disorder is color vision deficiency, affecting approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women in the world. Color vision deficiency, commonly known as color blindness, occurs when photopigment molecules are found in the incorrect photoreceptor cell (for example, if blue photopigments are located inside red cone receptors, the subject will perceive blue objects as red). Each of the mentioned disorders partially or fully impair the ability of an individual to effectively process visual information being received by the brain.\n\n(14). Yet more visual disorders are associated with a disruption of information being received by the brain, disorders which either distort the information received by the brain or eliminate it completely. In some cases, a complete loss of vision may result. It is believed that the reason sufferers of Charles-Bonnet Syndrome, for example, lose the ability to appropriately receive visual information, is due to being without sight for an extended time - without sight, the brain does not receive any visual stimulation. Once a Charles-Bonnet sufferer’s sight is restored, the visual process, having been out of practice, may manifest hallucinations and visual illusions.\n\n(15). Hallucinations caused by distortion of visual information received can also be found in syndromes such as Schizophrenia, but an important difference between sufferers of Schizophrenia and those affected by Charles-Bonnet Syndrome is that the latter can recognize that the hallucinations they are experiencing are not real.\n\n(16). Individuals suffering from Charles-Bonnet syndrome may see less complex visions, like lines, patterns, and mosaics. They may also see more complex images, including people and places. The hallucinations perceived by those with the Charles-Bonnet may be in color or occur in black and white; these images can be still or moving, brief or prolonged, small or large. Charles-Bonnet syndrome is often diagnosed in the elderly as this is the portion of society statistically most likely to encounter issues with their vision. For instance, age-related macular degeneration is one condition in older people that can lead to Charles-Bonnet syndrome. Although sufferers of Charles-Bonnet are aware that their visions are not real, the visions can nonetheless cause distress since individuals may believe they are suffering from a disorder such as dementia. Additionally, the presence of the images may overlay objects in the sufferer’s external world, making it difficult to navigate one’s environment safely.\n\n(17). There is some argument that, as a cognitive ability, our vision can be trained and augmented. Some research companies offer “visual perception training” services, which purportedly allow individuals to maintain or improve the performance of their sight by training the cognitive processes associated with vision to function better.\n\n(18). Mental imagery is an example of a task involving the cognitive processes of visual perception that does not use external stimuli. Humans employ the use of mental imagery in many ways daily; mental imagery is extremely useful in strategic thinking, such as visualizing the potential outcomes of a situation. Mental imagery is also employed in creative processes, where the brain first imagines or visualizes what is to be created. To conduct mental imagery, the brain draws on its prior knowledge of various elements, such as faces, objects and shapes, as well as non-visual sensations such as smell and touch, to create a new image. Creating and forming mental images is also an essential part of dreaming."

      "text": "(1). The cognitive processes associated with human vision are incredibly complex; what we call vision, sight, or “visual perception,” is the way in which we take in the information that our eyes receive, process, and interpret it. Such interpretations depend on individual cognitive processes and prior knowledge. The seemingly simple process of reading a passage of text, for instance, is, conversely, incredibly complicated, involving not only multiple subcomponents of vision, but also several distinct brain structures.\n\n(2). The visual system refers to the various components in the body, that work together to achieve visual perception. The process of vision begins when rays of light pass through the pupil of the eye and hit the retina, a light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye, activating receptor cells. This process is facilitated by the cornea - and subsequently the lens of the eye - which focus the light so that it can be received by the retina. The lens can adapt to feedback signals it receives from the brain to adjust its thickness to effectively refract light, so that it is focused onto the retina. It alters its thickness by changing shape to affect its curvature, which in turn adjusts the focal distance of the eye, meaning we can focus our visual perception at a variety of distances, from up close to long range. The human visual system can perceive visible light between 370 and 730 nanometers in wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n(3). The retina is a part of the brain and is designed to be a transducer (a device that converts energy from one form to another) for the conversion of light into neuronal signals. It contains photoreceptive cells, which can detect photons of light and produce neural impulses in response. Through the process of transduction, the retina converts energy from environmental stimuli - in this case light energy - to neural activity, which is a form of activity that the brain can understand and process.\n\n(4). The retina is composed of three different cell layers: a photoreceptor layer, a bipolar cell layer and a ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer is the inner layer, located at the very back of the eye. This layer’s photoreceptive cells can be divided into two types: rod photoreceptors, of which the function is to perceive objects in low light, and cone photoreceptors (responsible for color perception). There are three types of cone receptors: red, green, and blue. Cone photoreceptors contain photopigment molecules that respond to specific wavelengths of light hitting the cone photoreceptors and each wavelength corresponds to the specific color of the photoreceptor cell. When a specific wavelength hits the photoreceptor, the photopigment molecule splits into two; this action causes a message to be sent to the second cell layer of the retina (the bipolar cell layer), which then sends a message to the final layer of cells in the retina, known as the “ganglion layer.”\n\n(5).

This disorder results from damage to the sections of the brain, including the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, which are responsible for remembrance of crucial everyday items and their purposes. On the other hand, individuals with Associative Agnosia find it difficult to understand the meaning of what they are seeing. Unlike those with Perceptive Agnosia, they can draw a picture, but they cannot identify what they have drawn. They may mistake two objects of similar shape for one another, such as a rowing paddle and a cricket bat. Damage to the inferior occipitotemporal area of the brain, a section responsible for tasks including object recognition and visuospatial processing, causes this disorder.\n\n(13). Additional vision disorders associated with damaged cognitive processes include Akinetopsia (the inability to see movement), Achromatopsia (the inability to see colors), Prosopagnosia (the inability to recognize learned faces) and Alexia (the inability to interpret text). Another common vision disorder is color vision deficiency, affecting approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women in the world. Color vision deficiency, commonly known as color blindness, occurs when photopigment molecules are found in the incorrect photoreceptor cell (for example, if blue photopigments are located inside red cone receptors, the subject will perceive blue objects as red). Each of the mentioned disorders partially or fully impair the ability of an individual to effectively process visual information being received by the brain.\n\n(14). Yet more visual disorders are associated with a disruption of information being received by the brain, disorders which either distort the information received by the brain or eliminate it completely. In some cases, a complete loss of vision may result. It is believed that the reason sufferers of Charles-Bonnet Syndrome, for example, lose the ability to appropriately receive visual information, is due to being without sight for an extended time - without sight, the brain does not receive any visual stimulation. Once a Charles-Bonnet sufferer’s sight is restored, the visual process, having been out of practice, may manifest hallucinations and visual illusions.\n\n(15). Hallucinations caused by distortion of visual information received can also be found in syndromes such as Schizophrenia, but an important difference between sufferers of Schizophrenia and those affected by Charles-Bonnet Syndrome is that the latter can recognize that the hallucinations they are experiencing are not real.\n\n(16). Individuals suffering from Charles-Bonnet syndrome may see less complex visions, like lines, patterns, and mosaics. They may also see more complex images, including people and places. The hallucinations perceived by those with the Charles-Bonnet may be in color or occur in black and white; these images can be still or moving, brief or prolonged, small or large. Charles-Bonnet syndrome is often diagnosed in the elderly as this is the portion of society statistically most likely to encounter issues with their vision. For instance, age-related macular degeneration is one condition in older people that can lead to Charles-Bonnet syndrome. Although sufferers of Charles-Bonnet are aware that their visions are not real, the visions can nonetheless cause distress since individuals may believe they are suffering from a disorder such as dementia. Additionally, the presence of the images may overlay objects in the sufferer’s external world, making it difficult to navigate one’s environment safely.\n\n(17). There is some argument that, as a cognitive ability, our vision can be trained and augmented. Some research companies offer “visual perception training” services, which purportedly allow individuals to maintain or improve the performance of their sight by training the cognitive processes associated with vision to function better.\n\n(18). Mental imagery is an example of a task involving the cognitive processes of visual perception that does not use external stimuli. Humans employ the use of mental imagery in many ways daily; mental imagery is extremely useful in strategic thinking, such as visualizing the potential outcomes of a situation. Mental imagery is also employed in creative processes, where the brain first imagines or visualizes what is to be created. To conduct mental imagery, the brain draws on its prior knowledge of various elements, such as faces, objects and shapes, as well as non-visual sensations such as smell and touch, to create a new image. Creating and forming mental images is also an essential part of dreaming."

      "text": "(1). The cognitive processes associated with human vision are incredibly complex; what we call vision, sight, or “visual perception,” is the way in which we take in the information that our eyes receive, process, and interpret it. Such interpretations depend on individual cognitive processes and prior knowledge. The seemingly simple process of reading a passage of text, for instance, is, conversely, incredibly complicated, involving not only multiple subcomponents of vision, but also several distinct brain structures.\n\n(2). The visual system refers to the various components in the body, that work together to achieve visual perception. The process of vision begins when rays of light pass through the pupil of the eye and hit the retina, a light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye, activating receptor cells. This process is facilitated by the cornea - and subsequently the lens of the eye - which focus the light so that it can be received by the retina. The lens can adapt to feedback signals it receives from the brain to adjust its thickness to effectively refract light, so that it is focused onto the retina. It alters its thickness by changing shape to affect its curvature, which in turn adjusts the focal distance of the eye, meaning we can focus our visual perception at a variety of distances, from up close to long range. The human visual system can perceive visible light between 370 and 730 nanometers in wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n(3). The retina is a part of the brain and is designed to be a transducer (a device that converts energy from one form to another) for the conversion of light into neuronal signals. It contains photoreceptive cells, which can detect photons of light and produce neural impulses in response. Through the process of transduction, the retina converts energy from environmental stimuli - in this case light energy - to neural activity, which is a form of activity that the brain can understand and process.\n\n(4). The retina is composed of three different cell layers: a photoreceptor layer, a bipolar cell layer and a ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer is the inner layer, located at the very back of the eye. This layer’s photoreceptive cells can be divided into two types: rod photoreceptors, of which the function is to perceive objects in low light, and cone photoreceptors (responsible for color perception). There are three types of cone receptors: red, green, and blue. Cone photoreceptors contain photopigment molecules that respond to specific wavelengths of light hitting the cone photoreceptors and each wavelength corresponds to the specific color of the photoreceptor cell. When a specific wavelength hits the photoreceptor, the photopigment molecule splits into two; this action causes a message to be sent to the second cell layer of the retina (the bipolar cell layer), which then sends a message to the final layer of cells in the retina, known as the “ganglion layer.”\n\n(5). After the photoreceptor cells in the retina receive light energy and convert it into a neural impulse, the ganglion cells then send messages using the optic nerve, through the optic chiasma and to the brain. Ganglion cells are constantly firing, even when they do not receive stimulus, and the rate of firing increases or decreases depending on the message received from the bipolar cell layer - in this way, information is transmitted to the brain. The optic chiasma is located at the bottom of the brain, directly below the hypothalamus. Here, the optic nerves partially cross, so that the signals received from the right retina are sent to the left hemisphere, and those from the left retina are sent to the right.\n\n(6). Information is then received by the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus in the brain before it is sent to the visual association cortex in the occipital lobe. Following this, the occipital lobe puts together all the sensory information that was perceived by the visual system. In short, the visual association cortex allows us to perceive objects and interpret the entirety of the visual scenes we encounter.\n\n(7). The process of vision involves taking in and assessing a long list of characteristics. For instance, when we look at an object, to determine what we are looking at our brain uses our eyes and optic nerve to process the size of the object, its shape, position, lighting, contrast, color, and dimensions, in addition to whether the object is moving or stationary, how many of the same object are present at a given time, what the object is used for, and its name (all this information is processed within a fraction of a second).\n\n(8). Rather than passively observing information, the brain uses data such as prior knowledge and logic to complete visual pictures; these processes are carried out in specific areas of the occipital lobe, the temporal lobe, and the parietal lobe.\n\n(9). Good vision requires all the areas of the brain involved in visual perception to work together effectively, but there are a range of pathologies and disorders that can impact our visual perception. For example, damage to perceptive organs, such as parts of the eye, the optic nerve, or the parts of the brain involved in vision, can cause partial or total blindness. Glaucoma, diabetes mellitus and brain injury can affect visual perception and are some of the more common causes of blindness.\n\n(10). As vision is a complex process involving multiple areas of the brain, damage to any of these areas can hinder the vision process at its various stages, thus negatively impacting visual perception; such faults in these processes are linked to different disorders. One example is known as Visual Agnosia, which is the inability to recognize previously learned objects, despite the individual with the disorder having functioning sight. There are two types of Visual Agnosia: Perceptive Agnosia and Associative Agnosia.\n\n(11). Sufferers of Perceptive Agnosia can identify the components of an object but cannot interpret the object, while those with Associative Agnosia can process the whole object but cannot understand what it is. Although they do have functional sight, sufferers of Associative Agnosia experience a type of blindness, as they cannot interpret the information that is being received using their eyes.\n\n(12). An individual diagnosed with Perceptive Agnosia finds it challenging to recognize common sights such as body parts, buildings, and animals. Sufferers of the disorder encounter difficulties identifying manipulated items, such as blocks, puzzles, or beads. Those with Perceptive Agnosia cannot draw objects or copy figures.

They may mistake two objects of similar shape for one another, such as a rowing paddle and a cricket bat.

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, it is necessary to determine which part of the eye is responsible for focusing visual perception at a variety of distances. This can be accomplished by finding a description in the passage of each part of the eye listed in the option choices and systematically eliminating all those NOT responsible for focus. Paragraph 2 discusses the different parts of the eye. Based on this paragraph, only the lens is mentioned as being responsible for focusing vision at a variety of distances. It reads: “The process of vision begins when rays of light pass through the pupil of the eye and hit the retina, a light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye, activating receptor cells. This process is facilitated by the cornea - and subsequently the lens of the eye - which focuses the light so that it can be received by the retina. The lens can adapt to feedback signals it receives from the brain to adjust its thickness to effectively refract light so that it is focused onto the retina. It alters its thickness by changing shape to affect its curvature, which in turn adjusts the focal distance of the eye, meaning we can focus our visual perception at a variety of distances, from up close to long-range.” Thus, an injury to the lens most likely caused the symptoms of the individual in the question stem. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Iris – is incorrect because the iris is not mentioned anywhere in the passage. Option B. Cornea – is incorrect because the cornea is “a light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye, which activates receptor cells.” The injury described in the question stem relates to visual perception and focusing on various distances; thus, this is incorrect. Option D. Retina – is incorrect because, while this may seem correct, the retina is “a light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye, which activates receptor cells,” whereas the lens focuses light. Damage to the retina would not result in a person being unable to focus visual perception at various distances; thus, this is incorrect. Option E. Pupil – is incorrect because the pupil is where the vision process begins, and rays of light pass through the pupil to hit the retina. Damage to the pupil would not result in a person being unable to focus visual perception at various distances; thus, this is incorrect.",

      "text": "(1). Koch’s Postulates are used to establish a causal link between microbe and disease. Building on the works of Friedrich Loeffler and Jakob Henle in the 19 th century, Robert Koch constructed guidelines that evaluated whether a specific microorganism causes a specific disease. While experimenting with the blood of cows that died from anthrax, Koch observed rod-shaped bacteria within the blood. Intrigued by their presence, Koch injected the infected blood into healthy mice. After observing how the mice fell ill and died from anthrax, Koch’s hypothesis that this bacterium caused the disease was conclusively supported. Consequently, Koch constructed four postulates that established the causal link between a microorganism and disease. These postulates revolutionized medicine and gave way to the understanding of germ theory. Using Koch’s Postulates, scientists have been able to definitively assign specific bacteria as the causative agents of several diseases including tuberculosis and cholera.\n\n(2). The first postulate states that the microorganism must be found in the infected individual and not in healthy individuals. A strict interpretation of this postulate would entail assuming that the infected individuals depict symptoms of the disease while healthy individuals do not. However, as Koch later discovered, asymptomatic diseases also exist. Thus, despite the presence of the microorganism, infected individuals can appear to be the same as healthy individuals.\n\n(3). The second postulate states that the microorganism must be isolated from the diseased individual and grown in pure culture. Pure culture means that only one strand of that microorganism is present. Evidently, when a healthy individual’s blood is sampled and a pure culture is attempted to be made, no growth of the suspected bacteria within the culture medium should be observed.\n\n(4). The third postulate follows from the second as it states that when the cultured microorganism is inoculated into a healthy individual, it causes the disease in this individual. Presumably, this newly infected individual would be expected to show symptoms that deviate from when it was healthy. However, once again the presence of asymptomatic diseases complicates this interpretation. Regardless, the individual should objectively demonstrate their infected status, which leads to the fourth postulate.\n\n(5). The final postulate states that the microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated individual and matched to the originally isolated organism. By identifying this bacterium to be the same as the original, scientists can conclusively assert the causal link between this bacterium and the disease. In such a manner, Koch’s Postulates elucidate the etiology of diseases by linking them to specific microorganisms.\n\n(6). Koch’s Postulates are a helpful tool that allows scientists to approach the causative agent of disease in a logical manner. These postulates have been used as a checklist when designing and implementing experiments to systematically arrive at causal relationships between microorganisms and diseases. For instance, a scientist approaching the etiology of salmonellosis using this paradigm may utilize two specimens- A and B. Specimen B is observed to have diarrhea and fever while no symptoms are observed for A. When the scientist evaluates the blood sample of both these individuals, they discover the presence of salmonella enterica in Specimen B but not in A. To definitively recognize that the disease individual B is experiencing is caused by this bacterium, the scientist will grow this salmonella enterica in pure culture. This culture will then be inoculated into a healthy Specimen C. If Specimen C develops symptoms identical to Specimen B’s, or more importantly, has the same bacterium as Specimen B in its blood, then the scientist can be certain that indeed this bacterium caused the disease. Figure 1 illustrates the results the scientist can obtain which will conclusively demonstrate the causal link between salmonella enterica and salmonellosis.\n\nFigure 1: Effect of Inoculating Specimen C with Pure Culture Obtained from Specimen B. Blood sample obtained from Specimen C was analyzed to determine the growth of salmonella enterica. Diameter of colonies, in millimeters, represents bacterial growth with a greater diameter illustrating more proliferation of the bacterium. Positive control was pure salmonella enterica injected into a specimen identical to Specimen C. Negative control was saline solution injected into a specimen identical to Specimen C.\n\n(7). Nonetheless, there are limitations that exist with Koch’s Postulates’ applications to infectious diseases. As mentioned before, asymptomatic bacteria seem to violate the first postulate. The Bartonella species, for example, can live within the blood of infected individuals without causing disease. Additionally, these species have been found to cause a variety of phenotypically different diseases. Similarly, several infections are absent from the infected individual once symptoms develop. For example, Group A streptococcus infection is thought to cause rheumatic fever. However, once the lesions of rheumatic fever do appear, the infection is long gone. Thus, drawing one-to-one relationships between such species and the diseases they cause can prove to be difficult as they deviate from Koch’s Postulates.\n\n(8). Furthermore, many pathogens are unable to grow in nutrient medium culture which appear to violate Koch’s second postulate. These include the Mollicute bacteria which causes a myriad of diseases in humans. Viruses as well, do not grow in cell-free media. Hence, isolating pathogens from the infected individual and growing it in pure culture may not always be feasible. Additionally, certain infectious organisms grow poorly in blood cultures. These include the Heaemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae. Although these pathogens can cause endocarditis in children, they are notoriously known to be difficult to isolate and grow in culture.\n\n(9). It is also important to note that pathogenesis can be a multi-step process. Myocardial infarction for example, is the result of numerous conditions happening in sequence. Although bacterial infection is apart of this sequence, it is not the only thing that causes this disease. Thus, assigning the bacteria as the causative agent is erroneous. Likewise, the discovery of prions- nonliving agents that cause transmissible diseases in healthy individuals, complicates matters as it implies that living organisms do not need to be the cause of a disease. Hence, there are numerous limitations and exceptions when it comes to applying Koch’s Postulates to the study of diseases.\n\n(10). Since, Koch’s Postulates are unable to account for many infectious diseases, other criteria, such as the Bradford Hill criteria, and advancements in DNA sequencing have largely replaced Koch’s Postulates in examining the etiology of infectious diseases. Regardless, the fact remains that Koch’s Postulates transformed the way scientists approached diseases by making them realize that something as small as microorganisms can indeed have large-scale effects."

      "text": "(1). Koch’s Postulates are used to establish a causal link between microbe and disease. Building on the works of Friedrich Loeffler and Jakob Henle in the 19 th century, Robert Koch constructed guidelines that evaluated whether a specific microorganism causes a specific disease. While experimenting with the blood of cows that died from anthrax, Koch observed rod-shaped bacteria within the blood. Intrigued by their presence, Koch injected the infected blood into healthy mice. After observing how the mice fell ill and died from anthrax, Koch’s hypothesis that this bacterium caused the disease was conclusively supported. Consequently, Koch constructed four postulates that established the causal link between a microorganism and disease. These postulates revolutionized medicine and gave way to the understanding of germ theory. Using Koch’s Postulates, scientists have been able to definitively assign specific bacteria as the causative agents of several diseases including tuberculosis and cholera.\n\n(2). The first postulate states that the microorganism must be found in the infected individual and not in healthy individuals. A strict interpretation of this postulate would entail assuming that the infected individuals depict symptoms of the disease while healthy individuals do not. However, as Koch later discovered, asymptomatic diseases also exist. Thus, despite the presence of the microorganism, infected individuals can appear to be the same as healthy individuals.\n\n(3). The second postulate states that the microorganism must be isolated from the diseased individual and grown in pure culture. Pure culture means that only one strand of that microorganism is present. Evidently, when a healthy individual’s blood is sampled and a pure culture is attempted to be made, no growth of the suspected bacteria within the culture medium should be observed.\n\n(4). The third postulate follows from the second as it states that when the cultured microorganism is inoculated into a healthy individual, it causes the disease in this individual. Presumably, this newly infected individual would be expected to show symptoms that deviate from when it was healthy. However, once again the presence of asymptomatic diseases complicates this interpretation. Regardless, the individual should objectively demonstrate their infected status, which leads to the fourth postulate.\n\n(5). The final postulate states that the microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated individual and matched to the originally isolated organism. By identifying this bacterium to be the same as the original, scientists can conclusively assert the causal link between this bacterium and the disease. In such a manner, Koch’s Postulates elucidate the etiology of diseases by linking them to specific microorganisms.\n\n(6). Koch’s Postulates are a helpful tool that allows scientists to approach the causative agent of disease in a logical manner. These postulates have been used as a checklist when designing and implementing experiments to systematically arrive at causal relationships between microorganisms and diseases. For instance, a scientist approaching the etiology of salmonellosis using this paradigm may utilize two specimens- A and B. Specimen B is observed to have diarrhea and fever while no symptoms are observed for A. When the scientist evaluates the blood sample of both these individuals, they discover the presence of salmonella enterica in Specimen B but not in A. To definitively recognize that the disease individual B is experiencing is caused by this bacterium, the scientist will grow this salmonella enterica in pure culture. This culture will then be inoculated into a healthy Specimen C. If Specimen C develops symptoms identical to Specimen B’s, or more importantly, has the same bacterium as Specimen B in its blood, then the scientist can be certain that indeed this bacterium caused the disease. Figure 1 illustrates the results the scientist can obtain which will conclusively demonstrate the causal link between salmonella enterica and salmonellosis.\n\nFigure 1: Effect of Inoculating Specimen C with Pure Culture Obtained from Specimen B. Blood sample obtained from Specimen C was analyzed to determine the growth of salmonella enterica. Diameter of colonies, in millimeters, represents bacterial growth with a greater diameter illustrating more proliferation of the bacterium. Positive control was pure salmonella enterica injected into a specimen identical to Specimen C. Negative control was saline solution injected into a specimen identical to Specimen C.\n\n(7). Nonetheless, there are limitations that exist with Koch’s Postulates’ applications to infectious diseases. As mentioned before, asymptomatic bacteria seem to violate the first postulate. The Bartonella species, for example, can live within the blood of infected individuals without causing disease. Additionally, these species have been found to cause a variety of phenotypically different diseases. Similarly, several infections are absent from the infected individual once symptoms develop. For example, Group A streptococcus infection is thought to cause rheumatic fever. However, once the lesions of rheumatic fever do appear, the infection is long gone. Thus, drawing one-to-one relationships between such species and the diseases they cause can prove to be difficult as they deviate from Koch’s Postulates.\n\n(8). Furthermore, many pathogens are unable to grow in nutrient medium culture which appear to violate Koch’s second postulate. These include the Mollicute bacteria which causes a myriad of diseases in humans. Viruses as well, do not grow in cell-free media. Hence, isolating pathogens from the infected individual and growing it in pure culture may not always be feasible. Additionally, certain infectious organisms grow poorly in blood cultures. These include the Heaemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae. Although these pathogens can cause endocarditis in children, they are notoriously known to be difficult to isolate and grow in culture.\n\n(9). It is also important to note that pathogenesis can be a multi-step process. Myocardial infarction for example, is the result of numerous conditions happening in sequence. Although bacterial infection is apart of this sequence, it is not the only thing that causes this disease. Thus, assigning the bacteria as the causative agent is erroneous. Likewise, the discovery of prions- nonliving agents that cause transmissible diseases in healthy individuals, complicates matters as it implies that living organisms do not need to be the cause of a disease. Hence, there are numerous limitations and exceptions when it comes to applying Koch’s Postulates to the study of diseases.\n\n(10). Since, Koch’s Postulates are unable to account for many infectious diseases, other criteria, such as the Bradford Hill criteria, and advancements in DNA sequencing have largely replaced Koch’s Postulates in examining the etiology of infectious diseases. Regardless, the fact remains that Koch’s Postulates transformed the way scientists approached diseases by making them realize that something as small as microorganisms can indeed have large-scale effects."

Specimen A on the other hand, has no traces of salmonella enterica. Thus, if a sample of Specimen A’s blood was injected into Specimen C it would not be similar to Specimen B’s Pure Culture line.

There is no mention of growing a pure culture.

      "text": "(1). Koch’s Postulates are used to establish a causal link between microbe and disease. Building on the works of Friedrich Loeffler and Jakob Henle in the 19 th century, Robert Koch constructed guidelines that evaluated whether a specific microorganism causes a specific disease. While experimenting with the blood of cows that died from anthrax, Koch observed rod-shaped bacteria within the blood. Intrigued by their presence, Koch injected the infected blood into healthy mice. After observing how the mice fell ill and died from anthrax, Koch’s hypothesis that this bacterium caused the disease was conclusively supported. Consequently, Koch constructed four postulates that established the causal link between a microorganism and disease. These postulates revolutionized medicine and gave way to the understanding of germ theory. Using Koch’s Postulates, scientists have been able to definitively assign specific bacteria as the causative agents of several diseases including tuberculosis and cholera.\n\n(2). The first postulate states that the microorganism must be found in the infected individual and not in healthy individuals. A strict interpretation of this postulate would entail assuming that the infected individuals depict symptoms of the disease while healthy individuals do not. However, as Koch later discovered, asymptomatic diseases also exist. Thus, despite the presence of the microorganism, infected individuals can appear to be the same as healthy individuals.\n\n(3). The second postulate states that the microorganism must be isolated from the diseased individual and grown in pure culture. Pure culture means that only one strand of that microorganism is present. Evidently, when a healthy individual’s blood is sampled and a pure culture is attempted to be made, no growth of the suspected bacteria within the culture medium should be observed.\n\n(4). The third postulate follows from the second as it states that when the cultured microorganism is inoculated into a healthy individual, it causes the disease in this individual. Presumably, this newly infected individual would be expected to show symptoms that deviate from when it was healthy. However, once again the presence of asymptomatic diseases complicates this interpretation. Regardless, the individual should objectively demonstrate their infected status, which leads to the fourth postulate.\n\n(5). The final postulate states that the microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated individual and matched to the originally isolated organism. By identifying this bacterium to be the same as the original, scientists can conclusively assert the causal link between this bacterium and the disease. In such a manner, Koch’s Postulates elucidate the etiology of diseases by linking them to specific microorganisms.\n\n(6). Koch’s Postulates are a helpful tool that allows scientists to approach the causative agent of disease in a logical manner. These postulates have been used as a checklist when designing and implementing experiments to systematically arrive at causal relationships between microorganisms and diseases. For instance, a scientist approaching the etiology of salmonellosis using this paradigm may utilize two specimens- A and B. Specimen B is observed to have diarrhea and fever while no symptoms are observed for A. When the scientist evaluates the blood sample of both these individuals, they discover the presence of salmonella enterica in Specimen B but not in A. To definitively recognize that the disease individual B is experiencing is caused by this bacterium, the scientist will grow this salmonella enterica in pure culture. This culture will then be inoculated into a healthy Specimen C. If Specimen C develops symptoms identical to Specimen B’s, or more importantly, has the same bacterium as Specimen B in its blood, then the scientist can be certain that indeed this bacterium caused the disease. Figure 1 illustrates the results the scientist can obtain which will conclusively demonstrate the causal link between salmonella enterica and salmonellosis.\n\nFigure 1: Effect of Inoculating Specimen C with Pure Culture Obtained from Specimen B. Blood sample obtained from Specimen C was analyzed to determine the growth of salmonella enterica. Diameter of colonies, in millimeters, represents bacterial growth with a greater diameter illustrating more proliferation of the bacterium. Positive control was pure salmonella enterica injected into a specimen identical to Specimen C. Negative control was saline solution injected into a specimen identical to Specimen C.\n\n(7). Nonetheless, there are limitations that exist with Koch’s Postulates’ applications to infectious diseases. As mentioned before, asymptomatic bacteria seem to violate the first postulate. The Bartonella species, for example, can live within the blood of infected individuals without causing disease. Additionally, these species have been found to cause a variety of phenotypically different diseases. Similarly, several infections are absent from the infected individual once symptoms develop. For example, Group A streptococcus infection is thought to cause rheumatic fever. However, once the lesions of rheumatic fever do appear, the infection is long gone. Thus, drawing one-to-one relationships between such species and the diseases they cause can prove to be difficult as they deviate from Koch’s Postulates.\n\n(8). Furthermore, many pathogens are unable to grow in nutrient medium culture which appear to violate Koch’s second postulate. These include the Mollicute bacteria which causes a myriad of diseases in humans. Viruses as well, do not grow in cell-free media. Hence, isolating pathogens from the infected individual and growing it in pure culture may not always be feasible. Additionally, certain infectious organisms grow poorly in blood cultures. These include the Heaemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae. Although these pathogens can cause endocarditis in children, they are notoriously known to be difficult to isolate and grow in culture.\n\n(9). It is also important to note that pathogenesis can be a multi-step process. Myocardial infarction for example, is the result of numerous conditions happening in sequence. Although bacterial infection is apart of this sequence, it is not the only thing that causes this disease. Thus, assigning the bacteria as the causative agent is erroneous.

      "text": "(1). Koch’s Postulates are used to establish a causal link between microbe and disease. Building on the works of Friedrich Loeffler and Jakob Henle in the 19 th century, Robert Koch constructed guidelines that evaluated whether a specific microorganism causes a specific disease. While experimenting with the blood of cows that died from anthrax, Koch observed rod-shaped bacteria within the blood. Intrigued by their presence, Koch injected the infected blood into healthy mice. After observing how the mice fell ill and died from anthrax, Koch’s hypothesis that this bacterium caused the disease was conclusively supported. Consequently, Koch constructed four postulates that established the causal link between a microorganism and disease. These postulates revolutionized medicine and gave way to the understanding of germ theory. Using Koch’s Postulates, scientists have been able to definitively assign specific bacteria as the causative agents of several diseases including tuberculosis and cholera.\n\n(2). The first postulate states that the microorganism must be found in the infected individual and not in healthy individuals. A strict interpretation of this postulate would entail assuming that the infected individuals depict symptoms of the disease while healthy individuals do not. However, as Koch later discovered, asymptomatic diseases also exist. Thus, despite the presence of the microorganism, infected individuals can appear to be the same as healthy individuals.\n\n(3). The second postulate states that the microorganism must be isolated from the diseased individual and grown in pure culture. Pure culture means that only one strand of that microorganism is present. Evidently, when a healthy individual’s blood is sampled and a pure culture is attempted to be made, no growth of the suspected bacteria within the culture medium should be observed.\n\n(4). The third postulate follows from the second as it states that when the cultured microorganism is inoculated into a healthy individual, it causes the disease in this individual. Presumably, this newly infected individual would be expected to show symptoms that deviate from when it was healthy. However, once again the presence of asymptomatic diseases complicates this interpretation. Regardless, the individual should objectively demonstrate their infected status, which leads to the fourth postulate.\n\n(5). The final postulate states that the microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated individual and matched to the originally isolated organism. By identifying this bacterium to be the same as the original, scientists can conclusively assert the causal link between this bacterium and the disease. In such a manner, Koch’s Postulates elucidate the etiology of diseases by linking them to specific microorganisms.\n\n(6). Koch’s Postulates are a helpful tool that allows scientists to approach the causative agent of disease in a logical manner. These postulates have been used as a checklist when designing and implementing experiments to systematically arrive at causal relationships between microorganisms and diseases. For instance, a scientist approaching the etiology of salmonellosis using this paradigm may utilize two specimens- A and B. Specimen B is observed to have diarrhea and fever while no symptoms are observed for A. When the scientist evaluates the blood sample of both these individuals, they discover the presence of salmonella enterica in Specimen B but not in A. To definitively recognize that the disease individual B is experiencing is caused by this bacterium, the scientist will grow this salmonella enterica in pure culture. This culture will then be inoculated into a healthy Specimen C. If Specimen C develops symptoms identical to Specimen B’s, or more importantly, has the same bacterium as Specimen B in its blood, then the scientist can be certain that indeed this bacterium caused the disease. Figure 1 illustrates the results the scientist can obtain which will conclusively demonstrate the causal link between salmonella enterica and salmonellosis.\n\nFigure 1: Effect of Inoculating Specimen C with Pure Culture Obtained from Specimen B. Blood sample obtained from Specimen C was analyzed to determine the growth of salmonella enterica. Diameter of colonies, in millimeters, represents bacterial growth with a greater diameter illustrating more proliferation of the bacterium. Positive control was pure salmonella enterica injected into a specimen identical to Specimen C. Negative control was saline solution injected into a specimen identical to Specimen C.\n\n(7). Nonetheless, there are limitations that exist with Koch’s Postulates’ applications to infectious diseases. As mentioned before, asymptomatic bacteria seem to violate the first postulate. The Bartonella species, for example, can live within the blood of infected individuals without causing disease. Additionally, these species have been found to cause a variety of phenotypically different diseases. Similarly, several infections are absent from the infected individual once symptoms develop. For example, Group A streptococcus infection is thought to cause rheumatic fever. However, once the lesions of rheumatic fever do appear, the infection is long gone. Thus, drawing one-to-one relationships between such species and the diseases they cause can prove to be difficult as they deviate from Koch’s Postulates.\n\n(8). Furthermore, many pathogens are unable to grow in nutrient medium culture which appear to violate Koch’s second postulate. These include the Mollicute bacteria which causes a myriad of diseases in humans. Viruses as well, do not grow in cell-free media. Hence, isolating pathogens from the infected individual and growing it in pure culture may not always be feasible. Additionally, certain infectious organisms grow poorly in blood cultures. These include the Heaemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae. Although these pathogens can cause endocarditis in children, they are notoriously known to be difficult to isolate and grow in culture.\n\n(9). It is also important to note that pathogenesis can be a multi-step process. Myocardial infarction for example, is the result of numerous conditions happening in sequence. Although bacterial infection is apart of this sequence, it is not the only thing that causes this disease. Thus, assigning the bacteria as the causative agent is erroneous. Likewise, the discovery of prions- nonliving agents that cause transmissible diseases in healthy individuals, complicates matters as it implies that living organisms do not need to be the cause of a disease. Hence, there are numerous limitations and exceptions when it comes to applying Koch’s Postulates to the study of diseases.\n\n(10). Since, Koch’s Postulates are unable to account for many infectious diseases, other criteria, such as the Bradford Hill criteria, and advancements in DNA sequencing have largely replaced Koch’s Postulates in examining the etiology of infectious diseases. Regardless, the fact remains that Koch’s Postulates transformed the way scientists approached diseases by making them realize that something as small as microorganisms can indeed have large-scale effects."

      "text": "(1). Koch’s Postulates are used to establish a causal link between microbe and disease. Building on the works of Friedrich Loeffler and Jakob Henle in the 19 th century, Robert Koch constructed guidelines that evaluated whether a specific microorganism causes a specific disease. While experimenting with the blood of cows that died from anthrax, Koch observed rod-shaped bacteria within the blood. Intrigued by their presence, Koch injected the infected blood into healthy mice. After observing how the mice fell ill and died from anthrax, Koch’s hypothesis that this bacterium caused the disease was conclusively supported. Consequently, Koch constructed four postulates that established the causal link between a microorganism and disease. These postulates revolutionized medicine and gave way to the understanding of germ theory. Using Koch’s Postulates, scientists have been able to definitively assign specific bacteria as the causative agents of several diseases including tuberculosis and cholera.\n\n(2). The first postulate states that the microorganism must be found in the infected individual and not in healthy individuals. A strict interpretation of this postulate would entail assuming that the infected individuals depict symptoms of the disease while healthy individuals do not. However, as Koch later discovered, asymptomatic diseases also exist. Thus, despite the presence of the microorganism, infected individuals can appear to be the same as healthy individuals.\n\n(3). The second postulate states that the microorganism must be isolated from the diseased individual and grown in pure culture. Pure culture means that only one strand of that microorganism is present. Evidently, when a healthy individual’s blood is sampled and a pure culture is attempted to be made, no growth of the suspected bacteria within the culture medium should be observed.\n\n(4). The third postulate follows from the second as it states that when the cultured microorganism is inoculated into a healthy individual, it causes the disease in this individual. Presumably, this newly infected individual would be expected to show symptoms that deviate from when it was healthy. However, once again the presence of asymptomatic diseases complicates this interpretation. Regardless, the individual should objectively demonstrate their infected status, which leads to the fourth postulate.\n\n(5). The final postulate states that the microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated individual and matched to the originally isolated organism. By identifying this bacterium to be the same as the original, scientists can conclusively assert the causal link between this bacterium and the disease. In such a manner, Koch’s Postulates elucidate the etiology of diseases by linking them to specific microorganisms.\n\n(6). Koch’s Postulates are a helpful tool that allows scientists to approach the causative agent of disease in a logical manner. These postulates have been used as a checklist when designing and implementing experiments to systematically arrive at causal relationships between microorganisms and diseases. For instance, a scientist approaching the etiology of salmonellosis using this paradigm may utilize two specimens- A and B. Specimen B is observed to have diarrhea and fever while no symptoms are observed for A. When the scientist evaluates the blood sample of both these individuals, they discover the presence of salmonella enterica in Specimen B but not in A. To definitively recognize that the disease individual B is experiencing is caused by this bacterium, the scientist will grow this salmonella enterica in pure culture. This culture will then be inoculated into a healthy Specimen C. If Specimen C develops symptoms identical to Specimen B’s, or more importantly, has the same bacterium as Specimen B in its blood, then the scientist can be certain that indeed this bacterium caused the disease. Figure 1 illustrates the results the scientist can obtain which will conclusively demonstrate the causal link between salmonella enterica and salmonellosis.\n\nFigure 1: Effect of Inoculating Specimen C with Pure Culture Obtained from Specimen B. Blood sample obtained from Specimen C was analyzed to determine the growth of salmonella enterica. Diameter of colonies, in millimeters, represents bacterial growth with a greater diameter illustrating more proliferation of the bacterium. Positive control was pure salmonella enterica injected into a specimen identical to Specimen C. Negative control was saline solution injected into a specimen identical to Specimen C.\n\n(7). Nonetheless, there are limitations that exist with Koch’s Postulates’ applications to infectious diseases. As mentioned before, asymptomatic bacteria seem to violate the first postulate. The Bartonella species, for example, can live within the blood of infected individuals without causing disease. Additionally, these species have been found to cause a variety of phenotypically different diseases. Similarly, several infections are absent from the infected individual once symptoms develop. For example, Group A streptococcus infection is thought to cause rheumatic fever. However, once the lesions of rheumatic fever do appear, the infection is long gone. Thus, drawing one-to-one relationships between such species and the diseases they cause can prove to be difficult as they deviate from Koch’s Postulates.\n\n(8). Furthermore, many pathogens are unable to grow in nutrient medium culture which appear to violate Koch’s second postulate. These include the Mollicute bacteria which causes a myriad of diseases in humans. Viruses as well, do not grow in cell-free media. Hence, isolating pathogens from the infected individual and growing it in pure culture may not always be feasible. Additionally, certain infectious organisms grow poorly in blood cultures. These include the Heaemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae. Although these pathogens can cause endocarditis in children, they are notoriously known to be difficult to isolate and grow in culture.\n\n(9). It is also important to note that pathogenesis can be a multi-step process. Myocardial infarction for example, is the result of numerous conditions happening in sequence. Although bacterial infection is apart of this sequence, it is not the only thing that causes this disease. Thus, assigning the bacteria as the causative agent is erroneous. Likewise, the discovery of prions- nonliving agents that cause transmissible diseases in healthy individuals, complicates matters as it implies that living organisms do not need to be the cause of a disease. Hence, there are numerous limitations and exceptions when it comes to applying Koch’s Postulates to the study of diseases.\n\n(10). Since, Koch’s Postulates are unable to account for many infectious diseases, other criteria, such as the Bradford Hill criteria, and advancements in DNA sequencing have largely replaced Koch’s Postulates in examining the etiology of infectious diseases. Regardless, the fact remains that Koch’s Postulates transformed the way scientists approached diseases by making them realize that something as small as microorganisms can indeed have large-scale effects."

      "text": "(1). Koch’s Postulates are used to establish a causal link between microbe and disease. Building on the works of Friedrich Loeffler and Jakob Henle in the 19 th century, Robert Koch constructed guidelines that evaluated whether a specific microorganism causes a specific disease. While experimenting with the blood of cows that died from anthrax, Koch observed rod-shaped bacteria within the blood. Intrigued by their presence, Koch injected the infected blood into healthy mice. After observing how the mice fell ill and died from anthrax, Koch’s hypothesis that this bacterium caused the disease was conclusively supported. Consequently, Koch constructed four postulates that established the causal link between a microorganism and disease. These postulates revolutionized medicine and gave way to the understanding of germ theory. Using Koch’s Postulates, scientists have been able to definitively assign specific bacteria as the causative agents of several diseases including tuberculosis and cholera.\n\n(2). The first postulate states that the microorganism must be found in the infected individual and not in healthy individuals. A strict interpretation of this postulate would entail assuming that the infected individuals depict symptoms of the disease while healthy individuals do not. However, as Koch later discovered, asymptomatic diseases also exist. Thus, despite the presence of the microorganism, infected individuals can appear to be the same as healthy individuals.\n\n(3). The second postulate states that the microorganism must be isolated from the diseased individual and grown in pure culture. Pure culture means that only one strand of that microorganism is present. Evidently, when a healthy individual’s blood is sampled and a pure culture is attempted to be made, no growth of the suspected bacteria within the culture medium should be observed.\n\n(4). The third postulate follows from the second as it states that when the cultured microorganism is inoculated into a healthy individual, it causes the disease in this individual. Presumably, this newly infected individual would be expected to show symptoms that deviate from when it was healthy. However, once again the presence of asymptomatic diseases complicates this interpretation. Regardless, the individual should objectively demonstrate their infected status, which leads to the fourth postulate.\n\n(5). The final postulate states that the microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated individual and matched to the originally isolated organism. By identifying this bacterium to be the same as the original, scientists can conclusively assert the causal link between this bacterium and the disease. In such a manner, Koch’s Postulates elucidate the etiology of diseases by linking them to specific microorganisms.\n\n(6). Koch’s Postulates are a helpful tool that allows scientists to approach the causative agent of disease in a logical manner. These postulates have been used as a checklist when designing and implementing experiments to systematically arrive at causal relationships between microorganisms and diseases. For instance, a scientist approaching the etiology of salmonellosis using this paradigm may utilize two specimens- A and B. Specimen B is observed to have diarrhea and fever while no symptoms are observed for A. When the scientist evaluates the blood sample of both these individuals, they discover the presence of salmonella enterica in Specimen B but not in A. To definitively recognize that the disease individual B is experiencing is caused by this bacterium, the scientist will grow this salmonella enterica in pure culture. This culture will then be inoculated into a healthy Specimen C. If Specimen C develops symptoms identical to Specimen B’s, or more importantly, has the same bacterium as Specimen B in its blood, then the scientist can be certain that indeed this bacterium caused the disease. Figure 1 illustrates the results the scientist can obtain which will conclusively demonstrate the causal link between salmonella enterica and salmonellosis.\n\nFigure 1: Effect of Inoculating Specimen C with Pure Culture Obtained from Specimen B. Blood sample obtained from Specimen C was analyzed to determine the growth of salmonella enterica. Diameter of colonies, in millimeters, represents bacterial growth with a greater diameter illustrating more proliferation of the bacterium. Positive control was pure salmonella enterica injected into a specimen identical to Specimen C. Negative control was saline solution injected into a specimen identical to Specimen C.\n\n(7). Nonetheless, there are limitations that exist with Koch’s Postulates’ applications to infectious diseases. As mentioned before, asymptomatic bacteria seem to violate the first postulate. The Bartonella species, for example, can live within the blood of infected individuals without causing disease. Additionally, these species have been found to cause a variety of phenotypically different diseases. Similarly, several infections are absent from the infected individual once symptoms develop. For example, Group A streptococcus infection is thought to cause rheumatic fever. However, once the lesions of rheumatic fever do appear, the infection is long gone. Thus, drawing one-to-one relationships between such species and the diseases they cause can prove to be difficult as they deviate from Koch’s Postulates.\n\n(8). Furthermore, many pathogens are unable to grow in nutrient medium culture which appear to violate Koch’s second postulate. These include the Mollicute bacteria which causes a myriad of diseases in humans. Viruses as well, do not grow in cell-free media. Hence, isolating pathogens from the infected individual and growing it in pure culture may not always be feasible. Additionally, certain infectious organisms grow poorly in blood cultures. These include the Heaemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae. Although these pathogens can cause endocarditis in children, they are notoriously known to be difficult to isolate and grow in culture.\n\n(9).
