      "text": "(1). As we navigate our day-to-day life, we are constantly exposed to new information. Our brain acquires and handles this information through the process of learning. Over time, the material we learn is stored in our memories . This material, whether it be lyrics to a song or a picture of a familiar face, can be retrieved later. The ability to learn and retain information has enabled humans to adapt successfully to the surrounding environment; memory plays a large part in ensuring our survival .\n\n(2). Memory plays a significant part in ensuring human survival for a number of reasons. Memory allows us to avoid repeating the same mistakes, such as eating food that made us sick in the past. Memory also helped early humans to adapt to the migratory behaviors of other animals, thus assisting in the gathering of food sources. Furthermore, being that humans are highly social animals, remembering past interactions with those around us helps us to successfully navigate group interactions, leading to better cooperation amongst the species; in the past, such cooperation was vital when it came to activities such as hunting. Memory is also a critical component of problem-solving. When we call to mind past solutions to problems, we can use said solutions to adapt to challenging situations and unfamiliar environments. This was especially important when early humans depended on such problem-solving abilities to rebuild critical tools such as fire and shelter.\n\n(3). Researchers have classified different types of memories. When we refer to memory, we are usually referring to declarative , or explicit memory. This type of memory can be consciously and intentionally collected. It is easy to form and just as easy to forget. Examples of declarative memory include recalling a phone number or remembering a list of items. Declarative memory can be further broken down into episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memory involves remembering personally experienced events. For instance, recalling what you had for dinner the night before can be classified as episodic memory. Semantic memory includes memorizing general facts with no personal association. Recalling the capital of a foreign country is an example of semantic memory. Declarative memory is directed by the hippocampus and the frontal lobe, and so damage to these areas can compromise the ability to form such memories.\n\n(4). Non-declarative, or implicit memory, is a memory system that is used subconsciously and with little effort. It can be hard to verbalize as it does not require conscious thought. Examples of non-declarative memory consist of riding a bike or driving a car. Non-declarative memory can be divided into the following three sub-categories: procedural memory, classical conditioning , and priming . Procedural memory is the memory used to carry out a task. It is often associated with motor memory since the task is usually well-ingrained and almost automatic. Performing a task such as tying a shoelace or cooking an omelet can be considered a product of procedural memory.\n\n(5). Classical conditioning is the result of learning to associate one stimulus with another. An example of classical conditioning is Pavlov’s renowned experiment in which he conditions a dog to associate the sound of a bell with the arrival of food. Priming also involves an automatic process in which different cues of prior experience can trigger the retrieval of a memory. For instance, hearing certain words spoken can prime you to use those words yourself later. Non-declarative memory is directed by the cerebellum, basal ganglia , and cortical areas. Damage to these areas may impair the ability to create implicit memories.\n\n(6). For many years, scientists were under the impression that memories were stored in one specific part of the brain. In 1950 , Karl Lashley conducted an experiment to determine whether this was true. The purpose of Lashley’s experiment was to search for the engram , a group of neurons that served as a physical representation or location of memory . Lashley reasoned that if he found the engram, or memory trace, in one part of the mind, this would confirm which area of the brain was responsible for storing memories. To prove this, Lashley experimented with rats by training them to run through a maze without making mistakes. This was done to ensure the memory of the maze was encoded and stored in the rats’ brains. Then, Lashley created lesions in the brains to see if damage to a specific area would result in the loss of memory. Lashley soon realized that impairments in memory were correlated with the size of the lesions rather than the location of the lesions. Moreover, Lashley’s experiment showed that lesions to individual areas failed to erase the rats’ memories. This finding suggested that the engram was not located in one specific area, as initially postulated.\n\n(7). Many scientists believe that there are various parts of the brain involved in the storage and location of the engram . Researchers were able to narrow down the main structures associated with memory. The four main structures include the amygdala, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the prefrontal cortex . The amygdala is known to regulate emotions like fear and aggression. Scientists noticed that events associated with strong emotions were less likely to be forgotten. This led to the theory that the amygdala helps transfer emotional events or details into long-term memory. Since the storing of memories can be influenced by factors such as stress and emotions, this theory seems consistent.\n\n(8). The hippocampus plays a large role in memory . After several experiments with rats, researchers recognized that rats with lesions on their hippocampus suffered impairments in object recognition and maze running. This proved that the hippocampus was responsible for the recognition and spatial memory. During a human experiment, a patient known as H.M experienced a bilateral temporal lobectomy, involving the removal of his hippocampus. After this, the patient was no longer able to form new declarative memories. This incident suggests that the hippocampus is associated with processing explicit memories. The implicit, non-declarative, memories are processed by the cerebellum. Damage to the cerebellum may lead to the loss of implicit memories such as procedures or conditioned responses. Finally, the prefrontal cortex is responsible for the general processing and retaining of information.\n\n(9). The act of remembering involves three crucial steps in information processing. The first of these steps is the encoding stage. Encoding takes the information received from sensory inputs and converts it into a usable form for the brain to process. The brain may receive data from various sensory inputs. For instance, acoustic encoding converts auditory input such as sounds or spoken words while visual encoding converts visual input such as images or written words. The second step in creating a memory is the storage stage. This step is crucial for maintaining collected information for a certain period. The encoded information may initially be stored in short-term, or working memory. This memory can then be transferred to long-term memory through the process of consolidation. In short-term memory, information can enter the brain quickly. However, it is likely to be forgotten if not consolidated. The final step in memory processing is the retrieval stage. During this stage, our brain recalls the information from storage. This step often occurs in response to a cue. For example, an external retrieval cue such as the smell of a particular perfume may recall a childhood memory. Retrieval cues can also be internal. For instance, emotions of joy can assist in retrieving a happy memory. Whether external or internal, retrieval cues can make recalling memories a much faster process.\n\n(10). Issues can occur at any stage of the memory formation process, causing errors such as incomplete memory formation or even forgetfulness. For instance, when exposed to new information, your brain begins to encode that information into your memory. However, if you experience a distraction during that stage, it can lead to an encoding failure. In other cases, there may be an issue with the storage or consolidation of the memory. One of the most common causes of forgetting is retrieval failure which involves the inability to recall information from short-term or long-term storage. Retrieval failure theory suggests that we lose the ability to retrieve a memory because we either do not possess or fail to use the appropriate retrieval cues. Although the memory is still in our brain, we essentially lose the ability to access it. On the other hand, the decay theory proposes that the passage of time can cause a memory to fade. This suggests that our inability to retrieve certain memories is due to the simple fact that those memories no longer exist in our brains.\n\n(11). Forgetfulness is a natural part of growing older. However, there are certain cases where memory loss is more severe. For instance, amnesia is a condition that results in a serious loss of memory and even compromises one’s ability to learn. Incidents such as concussions, tumors, strokes, or even chronic alcoholism can cause amnesia. Amnesia can be dissociated, where there are no other cognitive deficits, or it can be limited, where a patient may suffer from other non-memory deficits. While the limited form of amnesia is more common, the dissociated form of amnesia is best suited for research.\n\n(12). Studies have shown that there are two major types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia involves forgetting things you once knew. Patients have difficulty remembering their past, but they still possess the ability to form new memories in the present. Anterograde amnesia consists of the inability to form new long-term memories. Old memories can remain intact despite failure to form new memories. This is commonly caused by brain trauma and usually involves damage to the hippocampus. Often, amnesiacs exhibit a combination of the two forms where they lose memories of the past while also having trouble forming new memories.\n\n(13). As individuals suffering solely from retrograde amnesia struggle to recall past events, memories related to the chronology of their life are often lost. Consequently, they are typically unable to recall important events and milestones, such as marriages or the birth of a child. Additionally, they might fail to recall those once familiar to them, like family members and friends. Because they also have trouble remembering their surroundings, they are prone to becoming disoriented. Individuals suffering only with anterograde amnesia, being unable to retain new memories but capable of remembering memories from before the onset of their condition, often engage in behavior typical of short-term memory loss, such as asking repetitive questions and a dependence on external reminders, such as calendars, notes, and alarms. Both retrograde and anterograde amnesia can have negative emotional impacts on sufferers, because the inability to recognize what should be easily identifiable can lead to anxiety and frustration.\n\n(14). A significant part of current neuroscientific research focuses on expanding our knowledge about the brain’s ability to learn and form memories. While there are many concepts we have yet to understand , researchers hope that future studies can provide clarity on different topics such as the location of the engram, the role of different brain structures in memory formation, and even potential treatments for memory loss. Advances in this field may lead to a future where scientists can improve memory retention and eliminate impairments in memory formation ."

The stem asks us to identify the type of memory that CANNOT be consciously retrieved. To answer this, we must first refer to the parts of the passage where we are introduced to the different types of memory. In paragraphs two and three, the author discusses the different types of memory. Regarding that which cannot be consciously retrieved, they note in paragraph 4: “Non-declarative, or implicit memory , is a memory system that is used subconsciously and with little effort. It can be hard to verbalize as it does not require conscious thought.” This tells us that, since implicit memory does not use conscious thought, it cannot be consciously retrieved. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Declarative memory – is incorrect because, in paragraph 3, the author introduces us to declarative or explicit memory. The author states: “This type of memory can be consciously and intentionally collected.” Since we are looking for a type of memory that CANNOT be consciously collected, this is incorrect. Option B. Semantic memory – is incorrect because, in paragraph 3, the author mentions two subcategories of declarative memories: episodic and semantic memory. Semantic memory, as a subtype, will also follow the same characteristics as declarative memory, in that it can be consciously collected; since we are looking for a type of memory that CANNOT be consciously collected, this is incorrect. Option D. External memory – is incorrect because, in paragraph 4, the author refers to external and internal retrieval cues but does NOT mention anything about external and internal memory; since this form of memory does not exist, this option can be eliminated.",

After this, the patient was no longer able to form new declarative memories. This incident suggests that the hippocampus is associated with processing explicit memories. The implicit, non-declarative, memories are processed by the cerebellum. Damage to the cerebellum may lead to the loss of implicit memories such as procedures or conditioned responses. Finally, the prefrontal cortex is responsible for the general processing and retaining of information.\n\n(9). The act of remembering involves three crucial steps in information processing. The first of these steps is the encoding stage. Encoding takes the information received from sensory inputs and converts it into a usable form for the brain to process. The brain may receive data from various sensory inputs. For instance, acoustic encoding converts auditory input such as sounds or spoken words while visual encoding converts visual input such as images or written words. The second step in creating a memory is the storage stage. This step is crucial for maintaining collected information for a certain period. The encoded information may initially be stored in short-term, or working memory. This memory can then be transferred to long-term memory through the process of consolidation. In short-term memory, information can enter the brain quickly. However, it is likely to be forgotten if not consolidated. The final step in memory processing is the retrieval stage. During this stage, our brain recalls the information from storage. This step often occurs in response to a cue. For example, an external retrieval cue such as the smell of a particular perfume may recall a childhood memory. Retrieval cues can also be internal. For instance, emotions of joy can assist in retrieving a happy memory. Whether external or internal, retrieval cues can make recalling memories a much faster process.\n\n(10). Issues can occur at any stage of the memory formation process, causing errors such as incomplete memory formation or even forgetfulness. For instance, when exposed to new information, your brain begins to encode that information into your memory. However, if you experience a distraction during that stage, it can lead to an encoding failure. In other cases, there may be an issue with the storage or consolidation of the memory. One of the most common causes of forgetting is retrieval failure which involves the inability to recall information from short-term or long-term storage. Retrieval failure theory suggests that we lose the ability to retrieve a memory because we either do not possess or fail to use the appropriate retrieval cues. Although the memory is still in our brain, we essentially lose the ability to access it. On the other hand, the decay theory proposes that the passage of time can cause a memory to fade. This suggests that our inability to retrieve certain memories is due to the simple fact that those memories no longer exist in our brains.\n\n(11). Forgetfulness is a natural part of growing older. However, there are certain cases where memory loss is more severe. For instance, amnesia is a condition that results in a serious loss of memory and even compromises one’s ability to learn. Incidents such as concussions, tumors, strokes, or even chronic alcoholism can cause amnesia. Amnesia can be dissociated, where there are no other cognitive deficits, or it can be limited, where a patient may suffer from other non-memory deficits. While the limited form of amnesia is more common, the dissociated form of amnesia is best suited for research.\n\n(12). Studies have shown that there are two major types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia involves forgetting things you once knew. Patients have difficulty remembering their past, but they still possess the ability to form new memories in the present. Anterograde amnesia consists of the inability to form new long-term memories. Old memories can remain intact despite failure to form new memories. This is commonly caused by brain trauma and usually involves damage to the hippocampus. Often, amnesiacs exhibit a combination of the two forms where they lose memories of the past while also having trouble forming new memories.\n\n(13). As individuals suffering solely from retrograde amnesia struggle to recall past events, memories related to the chronology of their life are often lost. Consequently, they are typically unable to recall important events and milestones, such as marriages or the birth of a child. Additionally, they might fail to recall those once familiar to them, like family members and friends. Because they also have trouble remembering their surroundings, they are prone to becoming disoriented. Individuals suffering only with anterograde amnesia, being unable to retain new memories but capable of remembering memories from before the onset of their condition, often engage in behavior typical of short-term memory loss, such as asking repetitive questions and a dependence on external reminders, such as calendars, notes, and alarms. Both retrograde and anterograde amnesia can have negative emotional impacts on sufferers, because the inability to recognize what should be easily identifiable can lead to anxiety and frustration.\n\n(14). A significant part of current neuroscientific research focuses on expanding our knowledge about the brain’s ability to learn and form memories. While there are many concepts we have yet to understand , researchers hope that future studies can provide clarity on different topics such as the location of the engram, the role of different brain structures in memory formation, and even potential treatments for memory loss. Advances in this field may lead to a future where scientists can improve memory retention and eliminate impairments in memory formation ."

      "text": "(1). As we navigate our day-to-day life, we are constantly exposed to new information. Our brain acquires and handles this information through the process of learning. Over time, the material we learn is stored in our memories . This material, whether it be lyrics to a song or a picture of a familiar face, can be retrieved later. The ability to learn and retain information has enabled humans to adapt successfully to the surrounding environment; memory plays a large part in ensuring our survival .\n\n(2). Memory plays a significant part in ensuring human survival for a number of reasons. Memory allows us to avoid repeating the same mistakes, such as eating food that made us sick in the past. Memory also helped early humans to adapt to the migratory behaviors of other animals, thus assisting in the gathering of food sources. Furthermore, being that humans are highly social animals, remembering past interactions with those around us helps us to successfully navigate group interactions, leading to better cooperation amongst the species; in the past, such cooperation was vital when it came to activities such as hunting. Memory is also a critical component of problem-solving. When we call to mind past solutions to problems, we can use said solutions to adapt to challenging situations and unfamiliar environments. This was especially important when early humans depended on such problem-solving abilities to rebuild critical tools such as fire and shelter.\n\n(3). Researchers have classified different types of memories. When we refer to memory, we are usually referring to declarative , or explicit memory. This type of memory can be consciously and intentionally collected. It is easy to form and just as easy to forget. Examples of declarative memory include recalling a phone number or remembering a list of items. Declarative memory can be further broken down into episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memory involves remembering personally experienced events. For instance, recalling what you had for dinner the night before can be classified as episodic memory. Semantic memory includes memorizing general facts with no personal association. Recalling the capital of a foreign country is an example of semantic memory. Declarative memory is directed by the hippocampus and the frontal lobe, and so damage to these areas can compromise the ability to form such memories.\n\n(4). Non-declarative, or implicit memory, is a memory system that is used subconsciously and with little effort. It can be hard to verbalize as it does not require conscious thought. Examples of non-declarative memory consist of riding a bike or driving a car. Non-declarative memory can be divided into the following three sub-categories: procedural memory, classical conditioning , and priming . Procedural memory is the memory used to carry out a task. It is often associated with motor memory since the task is usually well-ingrained and almost automatic. Performing a task such as tying a shoelace or cooking an omelet can be considered a product of procedural memory.\n\n(5). Classical conditioning is the result of learning to associate one stimulus with another. An example of classical conditioning is Pavlov’s renowned experiment in which he conditions a dog to associate the sound of a bell with the arrival of food. Priming also involves an automatic process in which different cues of prior experience can trigger the retrieval of a memory. For instance, hearing certain words spoken can prime you to use those words yourself later. Non-declarative memory is directed by the cerebellum, basal ganglia , and cortical areas. Damage to these areas may impair the ability to create implicit memories.\n\n(6). For many years, scientists were under the impression that memories were stored in one specific part of the brain. In 1950 , Karl Lashley conducted an experiment to determine whether this was true. The purpose of Lashley’s experiment was to search for the engram , a group of neurons that served as a physical representation or location of memory . Lashley reasoned that if he found the engram, or memory trace, in one part of the mind, this would confirm which area of the brain was responsible for storing memories. To prove this, Lashley experimented with rats by training them to run through a maze without making mistakes. This was done to ensure the memory of the maze was encoded and stored in the rats’ brains. Then, Lashley created lesions in the brains to see if damage to a specific area would result in the loss of memory. Lashley soon realized that impairments in memory were correlated with the size of the lesions rather than the location of the lesions. Moreover, Lashley’s experiment showed that lesions to individual areas failed to erase the rats’ memories. This finding suggested that the engram was not located in one specific area, as initially postulated.\n\n(7). Many scientists believe that there are various parts of the brain involved in the storage and location of the engram . Researchers were able to narrow down the main structures associated with memory. The four main structures include the amygdala, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the prefrontal cortex . The amygdala is known to regulate emotions like fear and aggression. Scientists noticed that events associated with strong emotions were less likely to be forgotten. This led to the theory that the amygdala helps transfer emotional events or details into long-term memory. Since the storing of memories can be influenced by factors such as stress and emotions, this theory seems consistent.\n\n(8). The hippocampus plays a large role in memory . After several experiments with rats, researchers recognized that rats with lesions on their hippocampus suffered impairments in object recognition and maze running. This proved that the hippocampus was responsible for the recognition and spatial memory. During a human experiment, a patient known as H.M experienced a bilateral temporal lobectomy, involving the removal of his hippocampus. After this, the patient was no longer able to form new declarative memories. This incident suggests that the hippocampus is associated with processing explicit memories. The implicit, non-declarative, memories are processed by the cerebellum. Damage to the cerebellum may lead to the loss of implicit memories such as procedures or conditioned responses.

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should read paragraph 10 carefully, before using the process of elimination to determine which answer choice most closely aligns with the point the author is attempting to make in this section of the text. After reading paragraph 10, we can see that the author does NOT mention that forgetfulness is natural or that distractions are the root cause of forgetting. They also do not claim in this paragraph that the retrieval theory is more accurate than the decay theory. We can say that the author presents retrieval failure theory and the decay theory and explains that they are two very different reasons as to why we may forget a memory. Thus, the author DOES imply that there are various reasons why we forget. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. The retrieval theory is more accurate than the decay theory – is incorrect because when the author discusses retrieval failure theory and decay theory, they do not place the two theories against each other to compare their merits. Rather, the author presents the two theories as equally viable reasons. Therefore, the author does not imply that one theory is more accurate than the other. For this reason, this option can be eliminated. Option B. Forgetfulness is primarily caused by distraction – is incorrect because this mentions distractions as the root, or main cause, of forgetting. If we refer to paragraph 10, the author mentions that distractions cause encoding failure. Later in the paragraph, the author states: “One of the most common causes of forgetting is retrieval failure […]” Thus, encoding failure, which is caused by distractions, is not actually the main cause of forgetting. Instead, one of the main causes of forgetting is retrieval failure. Therefore, Option B is false. Option C. Forgetfulness is a natural occurrence – is incorrect because, while Option C is mentioned by the author in paragraph 10, it is not actually discussed in it; rather, it is discussed as being natural in paragraph 11. As it is not a focus of the paragraph, this cannot be the best answer.",

      "text": "(1). As we navigate our day-to-day life, we are constantly exposed to new information. Our brain acquires and handles this information through the process of learning. Over time, the material we learn is stored in our memories . This material, whether it be lyrics to a song or a picture of a familiar face, can be retrieved later. The ability to learn and retain information has enabled humans to adapt successfully to the surrounding environment; memory plays a large part in ensuring our survival .\n\n(2). Memory plays a significant part in ensuring human survival for a number of reasons. Memory allows us to avoid repeating the same mistakes, such as eating food that made us sick in the past. Memory also helped early humans to adapt to the migratory behaviors of other animals, thus assisting in the gathering of food sources. Furthermore, being that humans are highly social animals, remembering past interactions with those around us helps us to successfully navigate group interactions, leading to better cooperation amongst the species; in the past, such cooperation was vital when it came to activities such as hunting. Memory is also a critical component of problem-solving. When we call to mind past solutions to problems, we can use said solutions to adapt to challenging situations and unfamiliar environments. This was especially important when early humans depended on such problem-solving abilities to rebuild critical tools such as fire and shelter.\n\n(3). Researchers have classified different types of memories. When we refer to memory, we are usually referring to declarative , or explicit memory. This type of memory can be consciously and intentionally collected. It is easy to form and just as easy to forget. Examples of declarative memory include recalling a phone number or remembering a list of items. Declarative memory can be further broken down into episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memory involves remembering personally experienced events. For instance, recalling what you had for dinner the night before can be classified as episodic memory. Semantic memory includes memorizing general facts with no personal association. Recalling the capital of a foreign country is an example of semantic memory. Declarative memory is directed by the hippocampus and the frontal lobe, and so damage to these areas can compromise the ability to form such memories.\n\n(4). Non-declarative, or implicit memory, is a memory system that is used subconsciously and with little effort. It can be hard to verbalize as it does not require conscious thought. Examples of non-declarative memory consist of riding a bike or driving a car. Non-declarative memory can be divided into the following three sub-categories: procedural memory, classical conditioning , and priming . Procedural memory is the memory used to carry out a task. It is often associated with motor memory since the task is usually well-ingrained and almost automatic. Performing a task such as tying a shoelace or cooking an omelet can be considered a product of procedural memory.\n\n(5). Classical conditioning is the result of learning to associate one stimulus with another. An example of classical conditioning is Pavlov’s renowned experiment in which he conditions a dog to associate the sound of a bell with the arrival of food. Priming also involves an automatic process in which different cues of prior experience can trigger the retrieval of a memory. For instance, hearing certain words spoken can prime you to use those words yourself later. Non-declarative memory is directed by the cerebellum, basal ganglia , and cortical areas. Damage to these areas may impair the ability to create implicit memories.\n\n(6). For many years, scientists were under the impression that memories were stored in one specific part of the brain. In 1950 , Karl Lashley conducted an experiment to determine whether this was true. The purpose of Lashley’s experiment was to search for the engram , a group of neurons that served as a physical representation or location of memory . Lashley reasoned that if he found the engram, or memory trace, in one part of the mind, this would confirm which area of the brain was responsible for storing memories. To prove this, Lashley experimented with rats by training them to run through a maze without making mistakes. This was done to ensure the memory of the maze was encoded and stored in the rats’ brains. Then, Lashley created lesions in the brains to see if damage to a specific area would result in the loss of memory. Lashley soon realized that impairments in memory were correlated with the size of the lesions rather than the location of the lesions. Moreover, Lashley’s experiment showed that lesions to individual areas failed to erase the rats’ memories. This finding suggested that the engram was not located in one specific area, as initially postulated.\n\n(7). Many scientists believe that there are various parts of the brain involved in the storage and location of the engram . Researchers were able to narrow down the main structures associated with memory. The four main structures include the amygdala, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the prefrontal cortex . The amygdala is known to regulate emotions like fear and aggression. Scientists noticed that events associated with strong emotions were less likely to be forgotten. This led to the theory that the amygdala helps transfer emotional events or details into long-term memory. Since the storing of memories can be influenced by factors such as stress and emotions, this theory seems consistent.\n\n(8). The hippocampus plays a large role in memory . After several experiments with rats, researchers recognized that rats with lesions on their hippocampus suffered impairments in object recognition and maze running. This proved that the hippocampus was responsible for the recognition and spatial memory. During a human experiment, a patient known as H.M experienced a bilateral temporal lobectomy, involving the removal of his hippocampus. After this, the patient was no longer able to form new declarative memories. This incident suggests that the hippocampus is associated with processing explicit memories. The implicit, non-declarative, memories are processed by the cerebellum. Damage to the cerebellum may lead to the loss of implicit memories such as procedures or conditioned responses. Finally, the prefrontal cortex is responsible for the general processing and retaining of information.\n\n(9). The act of remembering involves three crucial steps in information processing. The first of these steps is the encoding stage. Encoding takes the information received from sensory inputs and converts it into a usable form for the brain to process. The brain may receive data from various sensory inputs. For instance, acoustic encoding converts auditory input such as sounds or spoken words while visual encoding converts visual input such as images or written words. The second step in creating a memory is the storage stage. This step is crucial for maintaining collected information for a certain period. The encoded information may initially be stored in short-term, or working memory. This memory can then be transferred to long-term memory through the process of consolidation. In short-term memory, information can enter the brain quickly. However, it is likely to be forgotten if not consolidated. The final step in memory processing is the retrieval stage. During this stage, our brain recalls the information from storage. This step often occurs in response to a cue. For example, an external retrieval cue such as the smell of a particular perfume may recall a childhood memory. Retrieval cues can also be internal. For instance, emotions of joy can assist in retrieving a happy memory. Whether external or internal, retrieval cues can make recalling memories a much faster process.\n\n(10). Issues can occur at any stage of the memory formation process, causing errors such as incomplete memory formation or even forgetfulness. For instance, when exposed to new information, your brain begins to encode that information into your memory. However, if you experience a distraction during that stage, it can lead to an encoding failure. In other cases, there may be an issue with the storage or consolidation of the memory. One of the most common causes of forgetting is retrieval failure which involves the inability to recall information from short-term or long-term storage. Retrieval failure theory suggests that we lose the ability to retrieve a memory because we either do not possess or fail to use the appropriate retrieval cues. Although the memory is still in our brain, we essentially lose the ability to access it. On the other hand, the decay theory proposes that the passage of time can cause a memory to fade. This suggests that our inability to retrieve certain memories is due to the simple fact that those memories no longer exist in our brains.\n\n(11). Forgetfulness is a natural part of growing older. However, there are certain cases where memory loss is more severe. For instance, amnesia is a condition that results in a serious loss of memory and even compromises one’s ability to learn. Incidents such as concussions, tumors, strokes, or even chronic alcoholism can cause amnesia. Amnesia can be dissociated, where there are no other cognitive deficits, or it can be limited, where a patient may suffer from other non-memory deficits. While the limited form of amnesia is more common, the dissociated form of amnesia is best suited for research.\n\n(12). Studies have shown that there are two major types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia involves forgetting things you once knew. Patients have difficulty remembering their past, but they still possess the ability to form new memories in the present. Anterograde amnesia consists of the inability to form new long-term memories. Old memories can remain intact despite failure to form new memories. This is commonly caused by brain trauma and usually involves damage to the hippocampus. Often, amnesiacs exhibit a combination of the two forms where they lose memories of the past while also having trouble forming new memories.\n\n(13). As individuals suffering solely from retrograde amnesia struggle to recall past events, memories related to the chronology of their life are often lost. Consequently, they are typically unable to recall important events and milestones, such as marriages or the birth of a child. Additionally, they might fail to recall those once familiar to them, like family members and friends. Because they also have trouble remembering their surroundings, they are prone to becoming disoriented. Individuals suffering only with anterograde amnesia, being unable to retain new memories but capable of remembering memories from before the onset of their condition, often engage in behavior typical of short-term memory loss, such as asking repetitive questions and a dependence on external reminders, such as calendars, notes, and alarms. Both retrograde and anterograde amnesia can have negative emotional impacts on sufferers, because the inability to recognize what should be easily identifiable can lead to anxiety and frustration.\n\n(14). A significant part of current neuroscientific research focuses on expanding our knowledge about the brain’s ability to learn and form memories. While there are many concepts we have yet to understand , researchers hope that future studies can provide clarity on different topics such as the location of the engram, the role of different brain structures in memory formation, and even potential treatments for memory loss. Advances in this field may lead to a future where scientists can improve memory retention and eliminate impairments in memory formation ."

Memory is also a critical component of problem-solving. When we call to mind past solutions to problems, we can use said solutions to adapt to challenging situations and unfamiliar environments. This was especially important when early humans depended on such problem-solving abilities to rebuild critical tools such as fire and shelter.\n\n(3). Researchers have classified different types of memories. When we refer to memory, we are usually referring to declarative , or explicit memory. This type of memory can be consciously and intentionally collected. It is easy to form and just as easy to forget. Examples of declarative memory include recalling a phone number or remembering a list of items. Declarative memory can be further broken down into episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memory involves remembering personally experienced events. For instance, recalling what you had for dinner the night before can be classified as episodic memory. Semantic memory includes memorizing general facts with no personal association. Recalling the capital of a foreign country is an example of semantic memory. Declarative memory is directed by the hippocampus and the frontal lobe, and so damage to these areas can compromise the ability to form such memories.\n\n(4). Non-declarative, or implicit memory, is a memory system that is used subconsciously and with little effort. It can be hard to verbalize as it does not require conscious thought. Examples of non-declarative memory consist of riding a bike or driving a car. Non-declarative memory can be divided into the following three sub-categories: procedural memory, classical conditioning , and priming . Procedural memory is the memory used to carry out a task. It is often associated with motor memory since the task is usually well-ingrained and almost automatic. Performing a task such as tying a shoelace or cooking an omelet can be considered a product of procedural memory.\n\n(5). Classical conditioning is the result of learning to associate one stimulus with another. An example of classical conditioning is Pavlov’s renowned experiment in which he conditions a dog to associate the sound of a bell with the arrival of food. Priming also involves an automatic process in which different cues of prior experience can trigger the retrieval of a memory. For instance, hearing certain words spoken can prime you to use those words yourself later. Non-declarative memory is directed by the cerebellum, basal ganglia , and cortical areas. Damage to these areas may impair the ability to create implicit memories.\n\n(6). For many years, scientists were under the impression that memories were stored in one specific part of the brain. In 1950 , Karl Lashley conducted an experiment to determine whether this was true. The purpose of Lashley’s experiment was to search for the engram , a group of neurons that served as a physical representation or location of memory . Lashley reasoned that if he found the engram, or memory trace, in one part of the mind, this would confirm which area of the brain was responsible for storing memories. To prove this, Lashley experimented with rats by training them to run through a maze without making mistakes. This was done to ensure the memory of the maze was encoded and stored in the rats’ brains. Then, Lashley created lesions in the brains to see if damage to a specific area would result in the loss of memory. Lashley soon realized that impairments in memory were correlated with the size of the lesions rather than the location of the lesions. Moreover, Lashley’s experiment showed that lesions to individual areas failed to erase the rats’ memories. This finding suggested that the engram was not located in one specific area, as initially postulated.\n\n(7). Many scientists believe that there are various parts of the brain involved in the storage and location of the engram . Researchers were able to narrow down the main structures associated with memory. The four main structures include the amygdala, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the prefrontal cortex . The amygdala is known to regulate emotions like fear and aggression. Scientists noticed that events associated with strong emotions were less likely to be forgotten. This led to the theory that the amygdala helps transfer emotional events or details into long-term memory. Since the storing of memories can be influenced by factors such as stress and emotions, this theory seems consistent.\n\n(8). The hippocampus plays a large role in memory . After several experiments with rats, researchers recognized that rats with lesions on their hippocampus suffered impairments in object recognition and maze running. This proved that the hippocampus was responsible for the recognition and spatial memory. During a human experiment, a patient known as H.M experienced a bilateral temporal lobectomy, involving the removal of his hippocampus. After this, the patient was no longer able to form new declarative memories. This incident suggests that the hippocampus is associated with processing explicit memories. The implicit, non-declarative, memories are processed by the cerebellum. Damage to the cerebellum may lead to the loss of implicit memories such as procedures or conditioned responses. Finally, the prefrontal cortex is responsible for the general processing and retaining of information.\n\n(9). The act of remembering involves three crucial steps in information processing. The first of these steps is the encoding stage. Encoding takes the information received from sensory inputs and converts it into a usable form for the brain to process. The brain may receive data from various sensory inputs. For instance, acoustic encoding converts auditory input such as sounds or spoken words while visual encoding converts visual input such as images or written words. The second step in creating a memory is the storage stage. This step is crucial for maintaining collected information for a certain period. The encoded information may initially be stored in short-term, or working memory. This memory can then be transferred to long-term memory through the process of consolidation. In short-term memory, information can enter the brain quickly. However, it is likely to be forgotten if not consolidated. The final step in memory processing is the retrieval stage. During this stage, our brain recalls the information from storage. This step often occurs in response to a cue. For example, an external retrieval cue such as the smell of a particular perfume may recall a childhood memory. Retrieval cues can also be internal. For instance, emotions of joy can assist in retrieving a happy memory. Whether external or internal, retrieval cues can make recalling memories a much faster process.\n\n(10). Issues can occur at any stage of the memory formation process, causing errors such as incomplete memory formation or even forgetfulness. For instance, when exposed to new information, your brain begins to encode that information into your memory. However, if you experience a distraction during that stage, it can lead to an encoding failure. In other cases, there may be an issue with the storage or consolidation of the memory. One of the most common causes of forgetting is retrieval failure which involves the inability to recall information from short-term or long-term storage. Retrieval failure theory suggests that we lose the ability to retrieve a memory because we either do not possess or fail to use the appropriate retrieval cues. Although the memory is still in our brain, we essentially lose the ability to access it. On the other hand, the decay theory proposes that the passage of time can cause a memory to fade. This suggests that our inability to retrieve certain memories is due to the simple fact that those memories no longer exist in our brains.\n\n(11). Forgetfulness is a natural part of growing older. However, there are certain cases where memory loss is more severe. For instance, amnesia is a condition that results in a serious loss of memory and even compromises one’s ability to learn. Incidents such as concussions, tumors, strokes, or even chronic alcoholism can cause amnesia. Amnesia can be dissociated, where there are no other cognitive deficits, or it can be limited, where a patient may suffer from other non-memory deficits. While the limited form of amnesia is more common, the dissociated form of amnesia is best suited for research.\n\n(12). Studies have shown that there are two major types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia involves forgetting things you once knew. Patients have difficulty remembering their past, but they still possess the ability to form new memories in the present. Anterograde amnesia consists of the inability to form new long-term memories. Old memories can remain intact despite failure to form new memories. This is commonly caused by brain trauma and usually involves damage to the hippocampus. Often, amnesiacs exhibit a combination of the two forms where they lose memories of the past while also having trouble forming new memories.\n\n(13). As individuals suffering solely from retrograde amnesia struggle to recall past events, memories related to the chronology of their life are often lost. Consequently, they are typically unable to recall important events and milestones, such as marriages or the birth of a child. Additionally, they might fail to recall those once familiar to them, like family members and friends. Because they also have trouble remembering their surroundings, they are prone to becoming disoriented. Individuals suffering only with anterograde amnesia, being unable to retain new memories but capable of remembering memories from before the onset of their condition, often engage in behavior typical of short-term memory loss, such as asking repetitive questions and a dependence on external reminders, such as calendars, notes, and alarms. Both retrograde and anterograde amnesia can have negative emotional impacts on sufferers, because the inability to recognize what should be easily identifiable can lead to anxiety and frustration.\n\n(14). A significant part of current neuroscientific research focuses on expanding our knowledge about the brain’s ability to learn and form memories. While there are many concepts we have yet to understand , researchers hope that future studies can provide clarity on different topics such as the location of the engram, the role of different brain structures in memory formation, and even potential treatments for memory loss. Advances in this field may lead to a future where scientists can improve memory retention and eliminate impairments in memory formation ."

Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. To ascertain in which part of the brain engrains are found – is incorrect because this contains a spelling mistake. Although paragraph 6 tells us that Lashley WAS searching for the location of the engrams in the brain, as this was the end goal of his experiments on rats, Option A says “engrains” not “engrams” – thus, it is incorrect. Option C. To validate his hypothesis that memories are stored in the amygdala – is incorrect because the passage does not claim that Lashley ever hypothesized that memories were stored in the amygdala– thus, this is incorrect. Option D. To demonstrate that the hippocampus is responsible for spatial memory – is incorrect because, although paragraph 8 does state that the hippocampus is responsible for spatial memory, the passage does not imply that proving this was the reason that Lashley created lesions in the brains of rats.",

After this, the patient was no longer able to form new declarative memories. This incident suggests that the hippocampus is associated with processing explicit memories. The implicit, non-declarative, memories are processed by the cerebellum. Damage to the cerebellum may lead to the loss of implicit memories such as procedures or conditioned responses. Finally, the prefrontal cortex is responsible for the general processing and retaining of information.\n\n(9). The act of remembering involves three crucial steps in information processing. The first of these steps is the encoding stage. Encoding takes the information received from sensory inputs and converts it into a usable form for the brain to process. The brain may receive data from various sensory inputs. For instance, acoustic encoding converts auditory input such as sounds or spoken words while visual encoding converts visual input such as images or written words. The second step in creating a memory is the storage stage. This step is crucial for maintaining collected information for a certain period. The encoded information may initially be stored in short-term, or working memory. This memory can then be transferred to long-term memory through the process of consolidation. In short-term memory, information can enter the brain quickly. However, it is likely to be forgotten if not consolidated. The final step in memory processing is the retrieval stage. During this stage, our brain recalls the information from storage. This step often occurs in response to a cue. For example, an external retrieval cue such as the smell of a particular perfume may recall a childhood memory. Retrieval cues can also be internal. For instance, emotions of joy can assist in retrieving a happy memory. Whether external or internal, retrieval cues can make recalling memories a much faster process.\n\n(10). Issues can occur at any stage of the memory formation process, causing errors such as incomplete memory formation or even forgetfulness. For instance, when exposed to new information, your brain begins to encode that information into your memory. However, if you experience a distraction during that stage, it can lead to an encoding failure. In other cases, there may be an issue with the storage or consolidation of the memory. One of the most common causes of forgetting is retrieval failure which involves the inability to recall information from short-term or long-term storage. Retrieval failure theory suggests that we lose the ability to retrieve a memory because we either do not possess or fail to use the appropriate retrieval cues. Although the memory is still in our brain, we essentially lose the ability to access it. On the other hand, the decay theory proposes that the passage of time can cause a memory to fade. This suggests that our inability to retrieve certain memories is due to the simple fact that those memories no longer exist in our brains.\n\n(11). Forgetfulness is a natural part of growing older. However, there are certain cases where memory loss is more severe. For instance, amnesia is a condition that results in a serious loss of memory and even compromises one’s ability to learn. Incidents such as concussions, tumors, strokes, or even chronic alcoholism can cause amnesia. Amnesia can be dissociated, where there are no other cognitive deficits, or it can be limited, where a patient may suffer from other non-memory deficits. While the limited form of amnesia is more common, the dissociated form of amnesia is best suited for research.\n\n(12). Studies have shown that there are two major types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia involves forgetting things you once knew. Patients have difficulty remembering their past, but they still possess the ability to form new memories in the present. Anterograde amnesia consists of the inability to form new long-term memories. Old memories can remain intact despite failure to form new memories. This is commonly caused by brain trauma and usually involves damage to the hippocampus. Often, amnesiacs exhibit a combination of the two forms where they lose memories of the past while also having trouble forming new memories.\n\n(13). As individuals suffering solely from retrograde amnesia struggle to recall past events, memories related to the chronology of their life are often lost. Consequently, they are typically unable to recall important events and milestones, such as marriages or the birth of a child. Additionally, they might fail to recall those once familiar to them, like family members and friends. Because they also have trouble remembering their surroundings, they are prone to becoming disoriented. Individuals suffering only with anterograde amnesia, being unable to retain new memories but capable of remembering memories from before the onset of their condition, often engage in behavior typical of short-term memory loss, such as asking repetitive questions and a dependence on external reminders, such as calendars, notes, and alarms. Both retrograde and anterograde amnesia can have negative emotional impacts on sufferers, because the inability to recognize what should be easily identifiable can lead to anxiety and frustration.\n\n(14). A significant part of current neuroscientific research focuses on expanding our knowledge about the brain’s ability to learn and form memories. While there are many concepts we have yet to understand , researchers hope that future studies can provide clarity on different topics such as the location of the engram, the role of different brain structures in memory formation, and even potential treatments for memory loss. Advances in this field may lead to a future where scientists can improve memory retention and eliminate impairments in memory formation ."

      "text": "(1). As we navigate our day-to-day life, we are constantly exposed to new information. Our brain acquires and handles this information through the process of learning. Over time, the material we learn is stored in our memories . This material, whether it be lyrics to a song or a picture of a familiar face, can be retrieved later. The ability to learn and retain information has enabled humans to adapt successfully to the surrounding environment; memory plays a large part in ensuring our survival .\n\n(2). Memory plays a significant part in ensuring human survival for a number of reasons. Memory allows us to avoid repeating the same mistakes, such as eating food that made us sick in the past. Memory also helped early humans to adapt to the migratory behaviors of other animals, thus assisting in the gathering of food sources. Furthermore, being that humans are highly social animals, remembering past interactions with those around us helps us to successfully navigate group interactions, leading to better cooperation amongst the species; in the past, such cooperation was vital when it came to activities such as hunting. Memory is also a critical component of problem-solving. When we call to mind past solutions to problems, we can use said solutions to adapt to challenging situations and unfamiliar environments. This was especially important when early humans depended on such problem-solving abilities to rebuild critical tools such as fire and shelter.\n\n(3). Researchers have classified different types of memories. When we refer to memory, we are usually referring to declarative , or explicit memory. This type of memory can be consciously and intentionally collected. It is easy to form and just as easy to forget. Examples of declarative memory include recalling a phone number or remembering a list of items. Declarative memory can be further broken down into episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memory involves remembering personally experienced events. For instance, recalling what you had for dinner the night before can be classified as episodic memory. Semantic memory includes memorizing general facts with no personal association. Recalling the capital of a foreign country is an example of semantic memory. Declarative memory is directed by the hippocampus and the frontal lobe, and so damage to these areas can compromise the ability to form such memories.\n\n(4). Non-declarative, or implicit memory, is a memory system that is used subconsciously and with little effort. It can be hard to verbalize as it does not require conscious thought. Examples of non-declarative memory consist of riding a bike or driving a car. Non-declarative memory can be divided into the following three sub-categories: procedural memory, classical conditioning , and priming . Procedural memory is the memory used to carry out a task. It is often associated with motor memory since the task is usually well-ingrained and almost automatic. Performing a task such as tying a shoelace or cooking an omelet can be considered a product of procedural memory.\n\n(5). Classical conditioning is the result of learning to associate one stimulus with another. An example of classical conditioning is Pavlov’s renowned experiment in which he conditions a dog to associate the sound of a bell with the arrival of food. Priming also involves an automatic process in which different cues of prior experience can trigger the retrieval of a memory. For instance, hearing certain words spoken can prime you to use those words yourself later. Non-declarative memory is directed by the cerebellum, basal ganglia , and cortical areas. Damage to these areas may impair the ability to create implicit memories.\n\n(6). For many years, scientists were under the impression that memories were stored in one specific part of the brain. In 1950 , Karl Lashley conducted an experiment to determine whether this was true. The purpose of Lashley’s experiment was to search for the engram , a group of neurons that served as a physical representation or location of memory . Lashley reasoned that if he found the engram, or memory trace, in one part of the mind, this would confirm which area of the brain was responsible for storing memories. To prove this, Lashley experimented with rats by training them to run through a maze without making mistakes. This was done to ensure the memory of the maze was encoded and stored in the rats’ brains. Then, Lashley created lesions in the brains to see if damage to a specific area would result in the loss of memory. Lashley soon realized that impairments in memory were correlated with the size of the lesions rather than the location of the lesions. Moreover, Lashley’s experiment showed that lesions to individual areas failed to erase the rats’ memories. This finding suggested that the engram was not located in one specific area, as initially postulated.\n\n(7). Many scientists believe that there are various parts of the brain involved in the storage and location of the engram . Researchers were able to narrow down the main structures associated with memory. The four main structures include the amygdala, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the prefrontal cortex . The amygdala is known to regulate emotions like fear and aggression. Scientists noticed that events associated with strong emotions were less likely to be forgotten. This led to the theory that the amygdala helps transfer emotional events or details into long-term memory. Since the storing of memories can be influenced by factors such as stress and emotions, this theory seems consistent.\n\n(8). The hippocampus plays a large role in memory . After several experiments with rats, researchers recognized that rats with lesions on their hippocampus suffered impairments in object recognition and maze running. This proved that the hippocampus was responsible for the recognition and spatial memory. During a human experiment, a patient known as H.M experienced a bilateral temporal lobectomy, involving the removal of his hippocampus. After this, the patient was no longer able to form new declarative memories. This incident suggests that the hippocampus is associated with processing explicit memories. The implicit, non-declarative, memories are processed by the cerebellum. Damage to the cerebellum may lead to the loss of implicit memories such as procedures or conditioned responses.

      "text": "(1). As we navigate our day-to-day life, we are constantly exposed to new information. Our brain acquires and handles this information through the process of learning. Over time, the material we learn is stored in our memories . This material, whether it be lyrics to a song or a picture of a familiar face, can be retrieved later. The ability to learn and retain information has enabled humans to adapt successfully to the surrounding environment; memory plays a large part in ensuring our survival .\n\n(2). Memory plays a significant part in ensuring human survival for a number of reasons. Memory allows us to avoid repeating the same mistakes, such as eating food that made us sick in the past. Memory also helped early humans to adapt to the migratory behaviors of other animals, thus assisting in the gathering of food sources. Furthermore, being that humans are highly social animals, remembering past interactions with those around us helps us to successfully navigate group interactions, leading to better cooperation amongst the species; in the past, such cooperation was vital when it came to activities such as hunting. Memory is also a critical component of problem-solving. When we call to mind past solutions to problems, we can use said solutions to adapt to challenging situations and unfamiliar environments. This was especially important when early humans depended on such problem-solving abilities to rebuild critical tools such as fire and shelter.\n\n(3). Researchers have classified different types of memories. When we refer to memory, we are usually referring to declarative , or explicit memory. This type of memory can be consciously and intentionally collected. It is easy to form and just as easy to forget. Examples of declarative memory include recalling a phone number or remembering a list of items. Declarative memory can be further broken down into episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memory involves remembering personally experienced events. For instance, recalling what you had for dinner the night before can be classified as episodic memory. Semantic memory includes memorizing general facts with no personal association. Recalling the capital of a foreign country is an example of semantic memory. Declarative memory is directed by the hippocampus and the frontal lobe, and so damage to these areas can compromise the ability to form such memories.\n\n(4). Non-declarative, or implicit memory, is a memory system that is used subconsciously and with little effort. It can be hard to verbalize as it does not require conscious thought. Examples of non-declarative memory consist of riding a bike or driving a car. Non-declarative memory can be divided into the following three sub-categories: procedural memory, classical conditioning , and priming . Procedural memory is the memory used to carry out a task. It is often associated with motor memory since the task is usually well-ingrained and almost automatic. Performing a task such as tying a shoelace or cooking an omelet can be considered a product of procedural memory.\n\n(5). Classical conditioning is the result of learning to associate one stimulus with another. An example of classical conditioning is Pavlov’s renowned experiment in which he conditions a dog to associate the sound of a bell with the arrival of food. Priming also involves an automatic process in which different cues of prior experience can trigger the retrieval of a memory. For instance, hearing certain words spoken can prime you to use those words yourself later. Non-declarative memory is directed by the cerebellum, basal ganglia , and cortical areas. Damage to these areas may impair the ability to create implicit memories.\n\n(6). For many years, scientists were under the impression that memories were stored in one specific part of the brain. In 1950 , Karl Lashley conducted an experiment to determine whether this was true. The purpose of Lashley’s experiment was to search for the engram , a group of neurons that served as a physical representation or location of memory . Lashley reasoned that if he found the engram, or memory trace, in one part of the mind, this would confirm which area of the brain was responsible for storing memories. To prove this, Lashley experimented with rats by training them to run through a maze without making mistakes. This was done to ensure the memory of the maze was encoded and stored in the rats’ brains. Then, Lashley created lesions in the brains to see if damage to a specific area would result in the loss of memory. Lashley soon realized that impairments in memory were correlated with the size of the lesions rather than the location of the lesions. Moreover, Lashley’s experiment showed that lesions to individual areas failed to erase the rats’ memories. This finding suggested that the engram was not located in one specific area, as initially postulated.\n\n(7). Many scientists believe that there are various parts of the brain involved in the storage and location of the engram . Researchers were able to narrow down the main structures associated with memory. The four main structures include the amygdala, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the prefrontal cortex . The amygdala is known to regulate emotions like fear and aggression. Scientists noticed that events associated with strong emotions were less likely to be forgotten. This led to the theory that the amygdala helps transfer emotional events or details into long-term memory. Since the storing of memories can be influenced by factors such as stress and emotions, this theory seems consistent.\n\n(8). The hippocampus plays a large role in memory . After several experiments with rats, researchers recognized that rats with lesions on their hippocampus suffered impairments in object recognition and maze running. This proved that the hippocampus was responsible for the recognition and spatial memory. During a human experiment, a patient known as H.M experienced a bilateral temporal lobectomy, involving the removal of his hippocampus. After this, the patient was no longer able to form new declarative memories. This incident suggests that the hippocampus is associated with processing explicit memories. The implicit, non-declarative, memories are processed by the cerebellum. Damage to the cerebellum may lead to the loss of implicit memories such as procedures or conditioned responses. Finally, the prefrontal cortex is responsible for the general processing and retaining of information.\n\n(9). The act of remembering involves three crucial steps in information processing. The first of these steps is the encoding stage. Encoding takes the information received from sensory inputs and converts it into a usable form for the brain to process. The brain may receive data from various sensory inputs. For instance, acoustic encoding converts auditory input such as sounds or spoken words while visual encoding converts visual input such as images or written words. The second step in creating a memory is the storage stage. This step is crucial for maintaining collected information for a certain period. The encoded information may initially be stored in short-term, or working memory. This memory can then be transferred to long-term memory through the process of consolidation. In short-term memory, information can enter the brain quickly. However, it is likely to be forgotten if not consolidated. The final step in memory processing is the retrieval stage. During this stage, our brain recalls the information from storage. This step often occurs in response to a cue. For example, an external retrieval cue such as the smell of a particular perfume may recall a childhood memory. Retrieval cues can also be internal. For instance, emotions of joy can assist in retrieving a happy memory. Whether external or internal, retrieval cues can make recalling memories a much faster process.\n\n(10). Issues can occur at any stage of the memory formation process, causing errors such as incomplete memory formation or even forgetfulness. For instance, when exposed to new information, your brain begins to encode that information into your memory. However, if you experience a distraction during that stage, it can lead to an encoding failure. In other cases, there may be an issue with the storage or consolidation of the memory. One of the most common causes of forgetting is retrieval failure which involves the inability to recall information from short-term or long-term storage. Retrieval failure theory suggests that we lose the ability to retrieve a memory because we either do not possess or fail to use the appropriate retrieval cues. Although the memory is still in our brain, we essentially lose the ability to access it. On the other hand, the decay theory proposes that the passage of time can cause a memory to fade. This suggests that our inability to retrieve certain memories is due to the simple fact that those memories no longer exist in our brains.\n\n(11). Forgetfulness is a natural part of growing older. However, there are certain cases where memory loss is more severe. For instance, amnesia is a condition that results in a serious loss of memory and even compromises one’s ability to learn. Incidents such as concussions, tumors, strokes, or even chronic alcoholism can cause amnesia. Amnesia can be dissociated, where there are no other cognitive deficits, or it can be limited, where a patient may suffer from other non-memory deficits. While the limited form of amnesia is more common, the dissociated form of amnesia is best suited for research.\n\n(12). Studies have shown that there are two major types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia involves forgetting things you once knew. Patients have difficulty remembering their past, but they still possess the ability to form new memories in the present. Anterograde amnesia consists of the inability to form new long-term memories. Old memories can remain intact despite failure to form new memories. This is commonly caused by brain trauma and usually involves damage to the hippocampus. Often, amnesiacs exhibit a combination of the two forms where they lose memories of the past while also having trouble forming new memories.\n\n(13). As individuals suffering solely from retrograde amnesia struggle to recall past events, memories related to the chronology of their life are often lost. Consequently, they are typically unable to recall important events and milestones, such as marriages or the birth of a child. Additionally, they might fail to recall those once familiar to them, like family members and friends. Because they also have trouble remembering their surroundings, they are prone to becoming disoriented. Individuals suffering only with anterograde amnesia, being unable to retain new memories but capable of remembering memories from before the onset of their condition, often engage in behavior typical of short-term memory loss, such as asking repetitive questions and a dependence on external reminders, such as calendars, notes, and alarms. Both retrograde and anterograde amnesia can have negative emotional impacts on sufferers, because the inability to recognize what should be easily identifiable can lead to anxiety and frustration.\n\n(14). A significant part of current neuroscientific research focuses on expanding our knowledge about the brain’s ability to learn and form memories. While there are many concepts we have yet to understand , researchers hope that future studies can provide clarity on different topics such as the location of the engram, the role of different brain structures in memory formation, and even potential treatments for memory loss. Advances in this field may lead to a future where scientists can improve memory retention and eliminate impairments in memory formation ."

Performing a task such as tying a shoelace or cooking an omelet can be considered a product of procedural memory.” As recalling numbers is not a motor memory task, this is incorrect. Option D. Priming – is incorrect because in paragraph 5, the author states: “Priming also involves an automatic process in which different cues of prior experience can trigger the retrieval of a memory. For instance, hearing certain words spoken can prime you to use those words yourself later.” As recalling numbers is not a cue that triggers a memory, this is incorrect.",

      "text": "(1). As we navigate our day-to-day life, we are constantly exposed to new information. Our brain acquires and handles this information through the process of learning. Over time, the material we learn is stored in our memories . This material, whether it be lyrics to a song or a picture of a familiar face, can be retrieved later. The ability to learn and retain information has enabled humans to adapt successfully to the surrounding environment; memory plays a large part in ensuring our survival .\n\n(2). Memory plays a significant part in ensuring human survival for a number of reasons. Memory allows us to avoid repeating the same mistakes, such as eating food that made us sick in the past. Memory also helped early humans to adapt to the migratory behaviors of other animals, thus assisting in the gathering of food sources. Furthermore, being that humans are highly social animals, remembering past interactions with those around us helps us to successfully navigate group interactions, leading to better cooperation amongst the species; in the past, such cooperation was vital when it came to activities such as hunting. Memory is also a critical component of problem-solving. When we call to mind past solutions to problems, we can use said solutions to adapt to challenging situations and unfamiliar environments. This was especially important when early humans depended on such problem-solving abilities to rebuild critical tools such as fire and shelter.\n\n(3). Researchers have classified different types of memories. When we refer to memory, we are usually referring to declarative , or explicit memory. This type of memory can be consciously and intentionally collected. It is easy to form and just as easy to forget. Examples of declarative memory include recalling a phone number or remembering a list of items. Declarative memory can be further broken down into episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memory involves remembering personally experienced events. For instance, recalling what you had for dinner the night before can be classified as episodic memory. Semantic memory includes memorizing general facts with no personal association. Recalling the capital of a foreign country is an example of semantic memory. Declarative memory is directed by the hippocampus and the frontal lobe, and so damage to these areas can compromise the ability to form such memories.\n\n(4). Non-declarative, or implicit memory, is a memory system that is used subconsciously and with little effort. It can be hard to verbalize as it does not require conscious thought. Examples of non-declarative memory consist of riding a bike or driving a car. Non-declarative memory can be divided into the following three sub-categories: procedural memory, classical conditioning , and priming . Procedural memory is the memory used to carry out a task. It is often associated with motor memory since the task is usually well-ingrained and almost automatic. Performing a task such as tying a shoelace or cooking an omelet can be considered a product of procedural memory.\n\n(5). Classical conditioning is the result of learning to associate one stimulus with another. An example of classical conditioning is Pavlov’s renowned experiment in which he conditions a dog to associate the sound of a bell with the arrival of food. Priming also involves an automatic process in which different cues of prior experience can trigger the retrieval of a memory. For instance, hearing certain words spoken can prime you to use those words yourself later. Non-declarative memory is directed by the cerebellum, basal ganglia , and cortical areas. Damage to these areas may impair the ability to create implicit memories.\n\n(6). For many years, scientists were under the impression that memories were stored in one specific part of the brain. In 1950 , Karl Lashley conducted an experiment to determine whether this was true. The purpose of Lashley’s experiment was to search for the engram , a group of neurons that served as a physical representation or location of memory . Lashley reasoned that if he found the engram, or memory trace, in one part of the mind, this would confirm which area of the brain was responsible for storing memories. To prove this, Lashley experimented with rats by training them to run through a maze without making mistakes. This was done to ensure the memory of the maze was encoded and stored in the rats’ brains. Then, Lashley created lesions in the brains to see if damage to a specific area would result in the loss of memory. Lashley soon realized that impairments in memory were correlated with the size of the lesions rather than the location of the lesions. Moreover, Lashley’s experiment showed that lesions to individual areas failed to erase the rats’ memories. This finding suggested that the engram was not located in one specific area, as initially postulated.\n\n(7). Many scientists believe that there are various parts of the brain involved in the storage and location of the engram . Researchers were able to narrow down the main structures associated with memory. The four main structures include the amygdala, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the prefrontal cortex . The amygdala is known to regulate emotions like fear and aggression. Scientists noticed that events associated with strong emotions were less likely to be forgotten. This led to the theory that the amygdala helps transfer emotional events or details into long-term memory. Since the storing of memories can be influenced by factors such as stress and emotions, this theory seems consistent.\n\n(8). The hippocampus plays a large role in memory . After several experiments with rats, researchers recognized that rats with lesions on their hippocampus suffered impairments in object recognition and maze running. This proved that the hippocampus was responsible for the recognition and spatial memory. During a human experiment, a patient known as H.M experienced a bilateral temporal lobectomy, involving the removal of his hippocampus. After this, the patient was no longer able to form new declarative memories. This incident suggests that the hippocampus is associated with processing explicit memories. The implicit, non-declarative, memories are processed by the cerebellum. Damage to the cerebellum may lead to the loss of implicit memories such as procedures or conditioned responses. Finally, the prefrontal cortex is responsible for the general processing and retaining of information.\n\n(9). The act of remembering involves three crucial steps in information processing. The first of these steps is the encoding stage. Encoding takes the information received from sensory inputs and converts it into a usable form for the brain to process. The brain may receive data from various sensory inputs. For instance, acoustic encoding converts auditory input such as sounds or spoken words while visual encoding converts visual input such as images or written words. The second step in creating a memory is the storage stage. This step is crucial for maintaining collected information for a certain period. The encoded information may initially be stored in short-term, or working memory. This memory can then be transferred to long-term memory through the process of consolidation. In short-term memory, information can enter the brain quickly. However, it is likely to be forgotten if not consolidated. The final step in memory processing is the retrieval stage. During this stage, our brain recalls the information from storage. This step often occurs in response to a cue. For example, an external retrieval cue such as the smell of a particular perfume may recall a childhood memory. Retrieval cues can also be internal. For instance, emotions of joy can assist in retrieving a happy memory. Whether external or internal, retrieval cues can make recalling memories a much faster process.\n\n(10). Issues can occur at any stage of the memory formation process, causing errors such as incomplete memory formation or even forgetfulness. For instance, when exposed to new information, your brain begins to encode that information into your memory. However, if you experience a distraction during that stage, it can lead to an encoding failure. In other cases, there may be an issue with the storage or consolidation of the memory. One of the most common causes of forgetting is retrieval failure which involves the inability to recall information from short-term or long-term storage. Retrieval failure theory suggests that we lose the ability to retrieve a memory because we either do not possess or fail to use the appropriate retrieval cues. Although the memory is still in our brain, we essentially lose the ability to access it. On the other hand, the decay theory proposes that the passage of time can cause a memory to fade. This suggests that our inability to retrieve certain memories is due to the simple fact that those memories no longer exist in our brains.\n\n(11). Forgetfulness is a natural part of growing older. However, there are certain cases where memory loss is more severe. For instance, amnesia is a condition that results in a serious loss of memory and even compromises one’s ability to learn. Incidents such as concussions, tumors, strokes, or even chronic alcoholism can cause amnesia. Amnesia can be dissociated, where there are no other cognitive deficits, or it can be limited, where a patient may suffer from other non-memory deficits. While the limited form of amnesia is more common, the dissociated form of amnesia is best suited for research.\n\n(12). Studies have shown that there are two major types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia involves forgetting things you once knew. Patients have difficulty remembering their past, but they still possess the ability to form new memories in the present. Anterograde amnesia consists of the inability to form new long-term memories. Old memories can remain intact despite failure to form new memories. This is commonly caused by brain trauma and usually involves damage to the hippocampus. Often, amnesiacs exhibit a combination of the two forms where they lose memories of the past while also having trouble forming new memories.\n\n(13). As individuals suffering solely from retrograde amnesia struggle to recall past events, memories related to the chronology of their life are often lost. Consequently, they are typically unable to recall important events and milestones, such as marriages or the birth of a child. Additionally, they might fail to recall those once familiar to them, like family members and friends. Because they also have trouble remembering their surroundings, they are prone to becoming disoriented. Individuals suffering only with anterograde amnesia, being unable to retain new memories but capable of remembering memories from before the onset of their condition, often engage in behavior typical of short-term memory loss, such as asking repetitive questions and a dependence on external reminders, such as calendars, notes, and alarms. Both retrograde and anterograde amnesia can have negative emotional impacts on sufferers, because the inability to recognize what should be easily identifiable can lead to anxiety and frustration.\n\n(14). A significant part of current neuroscientific research focuses on expanding our knowledge about the brain’s ability to learn and form memories. While there are many concepts we have yet to understand , researchers hope that future studies can provide clarity on different topics such as the location of the engram, the role of different brain structures in memory formation, and even potential treatments for memory loss. Advances in this field may lead to a future where scientists can improve memory retention and eliminate impairments in memory formation ."

Then, Lashley created lesions in the brains to see if damage to a specific area would result in the loss of memory. Lashley soon realized that impairments in memory were correlated with the size of the lesions rather than the location of the lesions. Moreover, Lashley’s experiment showed that lesions to individual areas failed to erase the rats’ memories. This finding suggested that the engram was not located in one specific area, as initially postulated.\n\n(7). Many scientists believe that there are various parts of the brain involved in the storage and location of the engram . Researchers were able to narrow down the main structures associated with memory. The four main structures include the amygdala, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the prefrontal cortex . The amygdala is known to regulate emotions like fear and aggression. Scientists noticed that events associated with strong emotions were less likely to be forgotten. This led to the theory that the amygdala helps transfer emotional events or details into long-term memory. Since the storing of memories can be influenced by factors such as stress and emotions, this theory seems consistent.\n\n(8). The hippocampus plays a large role in memory . After several experiments with rats, researchers recognized that rats with lesions on their hippocampus suffered impairments in object recognition and maze running. This proved that the hippocampus was responsible for the recognition and spatial memory. During a human experiment, a patient known as H.M experienced a bilateral temporal lobectomy, involving the removal of his hippocampus. After this, the patient was no longer able to form new declarative memories. This incident suggests that the hippocampus is associated with processing explicit memories. The implicit, non-declarative, memories are processed by the cerebellum. Damage to the cerebellum may lead to the loss of implicit memories such as procedures or conditioned responses. Finally, the prefrontal cortex is responsible for the general processing and retaining of information.\n\n(9). The act of remembering involves three crucial steps in information processing. The first of these steps is the encoding stage. Encoding takes the information received from sensory inputs and converts it into a usable form for the brain to process. The brain may receive data from various sensory inputs. For instance, acoustic encoding converts auditory input such as sounds or spoken words while visual encoding converts visual input such as images or written words. The second step in creating a memory is the storage stage. This step is crucial for maintaining collected information for a certain period. The encoded information may initially be stored in short-term, or working memory. This memory can then be transferred to long-term memory through the process of consolidation. In short-term memory, information can enter the brain quickly. However, it is likely to be forgotten if not consolidated. The final step in memory processing is the retrieval stage. During this stage, our brain recalls the information from storage. This step often occurs in response to a cue. For example, an external retrieval cue such as the smell of a particular perfume may recall a childhood memory. Retrieval cues can also be internal. For instance, emotions of joy can assist in retrieving a happy memory. Whether external or internal, retrieval cues can make recalling memories a much faster process.\n\n(10). Issues can occur at any stage of the memory formation process, causing errors such as incomplete memory formation or even forgetfulness. For instance, when exposed to new information, your brain begins to encode that information into your memory. However, if you experience a distraction during that stage, it can lead to an encoding failure. In other cases, there may be an issue with the storage or consolidation of the memory. One of the most common causes of forgetting is retrieval failure which involves the inability to recall information from short-term or long-term storage. Retrieval failure theory suggests that we lose the ability to retrieve a memory because we either do not possess or fail to use the appropriate retrieval cues. Although the memory is still in our brain, we essentially lose the ability to access it. On the other hand, the decay theory proposes that the passage of time can cause a memory to fade. This suggests that our inability to retrieve certain memories is due to the simple fact that those memories no longer exist in our brains.\n\n(11). Forgetfulness is a natural part of growing older. However, there are certain cases where memory loss is more severe. For instance, amnesia is a condition that results in a serious loss of memory and even compromises one’s ability to learn. Incidents such as concussions, tumors, strokes, or even chronic alcoholism can cause amnesia. Amnesia can be dissociated, where there are no other cognitive deficits, or it can be limited, where a patient may suffer from other non-memory deficits. While the limited form of amnesia is more common, the dissociated form of amnesia is best suited for research.\n\n(12). Studies have shown that there are two major types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia involves forgetting things you once knew. Patients have difficulty remembering their past, but they still possess the ability to form new memories in the present. Anterograde amnesia consists of the inability to form new long-term memories. Old memories can remain intact despite failure to form new memories. This is commonly caused by brain trauma and usually involves damage to the hippocampus. Often, amnesiacs exhibit a combination of the two forms where they lose memories of the past while also having trouble forming new memories.\n\n(13). As individuals suffering solely from retrograde amnesia struggle to recall past events, memories related to the chronology of their life are often lost. Consequently, they are typically unable to recall important events and milestones, such as marriages or the birth of a child. Additionally, they might fail to recall those once familiar to them, like family members and friends. Because they also have trouble remembering their surroundings, they are prone to becoming disoriented. Individuals suffering only with anterograde amnesia, being unable to retain new memories but capable of remembering memories from before the onset of their condition, often engage in behavior typical of short-term memory loss, such as asking repetitive questions and a dependence on external reminders, such as calendars, notes, and alarms. Both retrograde and anterograde amnesia can have negative emotional impacts on sufferers, because the inability to recognize what should be easily identifiable can lead to anxiety and frustration.\n\n(14). A significant part of current neuroscientific research focuses on expanding our knowledge about the brain’s ability to learn and form memories. While there are many concepts we have yet to understand , researchers hope that future studies can provide clarity on different topics such as the location of the engram, the role of different brain structures in memory formation, and even potential treatments for memory loss. Advances in this field may lead to a future where scientists can improve memory retention and eliminate impairments in memory formation ."

      "text": "(1). Crocodilians are ambush hunters . Ferocious reptiles, these animals wait half-submerged for land-bound prey to disturb the water surface. Additionally, they appear to have specialized sensory organs on their faces, which can detect silent ripples on the surface of the surrounding water, even in complete darkness. These specialized organs were previously known as “ integumentary sense organs” and were used to distinguish between the alligatorid and the crocodilian families. However, their function, innervation, and phylogenetic history remained unknown. A functionally descriptive name for these organs, as suggested by Soares, is now “dome pressure receptors'' or “ DPRs .”\n\n(2). DPRs , as the name suggests, are round, dome-like structures that lack the presence of pores or protruding hairs. The epidermis located immediately above them is 40% thinner, while the keratin layer is 60% thinner and is considered to be more compact. The faces of alligators are covered with these small, pigmented dome-shaped spots, which are typically 0.5 mm in diameter; it is estimated that thousands of such sensory organs stud the face of an alligator. The distribution of these domes on the alligator’s exterior resembles that of a beard; however, it is also important to note that they are present on the inside of the mouth as well. DPRs are additionally found in fossils dating from the Jurassic Period, suggesting that, alongside possessing an armoured exterior, these semi-aquatic predators had developed distinct tactile sensitivity many millions of years ago.\n\n(3). In behavioral trials, half-submerged alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) have been observed orienting themselves to single water droplets in total darkness and without the use of audition. This orienting behavior demonstrated by crocodiles has been deemed robust in literature. The behavioral response was either head-turning or a full-body lunge in the direction of the source. Notably, this occurred only when the alligators’ faces were positioned on the air-water interface, but such a response was absent in cases where their faces were completely submerged or, conversely, were entirely out of the water.\n\n(4). The highly branched nerve bundle driving the croc’s tactile sensitivity is located a dermal fold below each organ; known as the trigeminal nerve, it is the largest of the twelve cranial nerves in the alligator and is commonly abbreviated as “ CN V .” As it can transmit both sensory and motor information, it is referred to as a mixed cranial nerve . It is divided into three main branches: the ophthalmic, the maxillary, and the mandibular , and each division serves a distinct role. While the ophthalmic and the maxillary only transmit sensory information from the upper face, the mandibular division provides motor innervation to the jaw muscles and also transmits sensation from the mandible and the tongue. Several vertebrates evolved trigeminal nerve-based specialized sensory systems, such as electroreceptors in the platypus as well as infrared receptors in certain snake species.\n\n(5). In crocodilians, CN V roots arise from the brain at the lateral corner of the medulla oblongata, and exit the endocranial cavity via the trigeminal foramen , which is a short passageway or opening. From here, they enter a depression known as the “trigeminal fossa” also referred to as the “ Meckel’s cave, ” which is formed by the lateralsphenoid rostrally and the prootic caudally. This is the location where the trigeminal ganglion is located with the lateralsphenoid and prootic medially and the quadrate and pterygoid bones laterally. The ophthalmic branch exits rostrally from the trigeminal ganglion through its own trough in the laterospheoid; however, the maxillary and the mandibular branches arise from the lateral part of the ganglion, exiting the trigeminal fossa through the maxillomandibular foramen . Although the specific pathway of the mandibular nerve is understood and described in literature, it is nonetheless complex. It is of great significance to note that, after the mandibular nerve continues through the mandible, it emits several variable sized axons that penetrate the lateral surface of the dentary, which is the anterior surface of the teeth-bearing lower jaw. From there, the axons terminate in the integument as nerve endings as well as DPRs.\n\n(6). As described by Daphne Soares in Nature’s article, “An ancient sensory organ in crocodilians”, published in 2002, recordings from the trigeminal ganglion revealed that DPRs appear to be sensitive to surface waves that were created with a piezoelectric “poker”, a type of surface-wave generator. The aforementioned generator was composed of a sinusoidal-wave generator attached to a rod, which was in turn connected to a speaker. Surface waves induced a single spike phase locked to the stimulus, and an increase in the wave amplitude resulted in an increased probability of spike firing. In order to stimulate individual receptors along with the skin that lies between them, Soares opted for a blunt, closed capillary tube attached to a piezoelectric wafer, which served as the secondary stimulus. Soares’ observation was that, while under continuous pressure, the DPR responses adapted quickly. In particular, no response was observed when the skin between the DPRs was exposed to the same pressure that had evoked a response in the DPRs. This finding was consistent with the understanding that DPRs are responsible for detecting pressure waves linked to disruptions to the air-water interface. As a result, Soares suggests that DPRs are perhaps sensitive to pressure differences but not to particle motion.\n\n(7). According to behavioural, paleontological, anatomical, and physiological evidence, crocodilians-an ancient monophyletic group in existence since before even the time of dinosaurs -have evolved a remarkable sensory organ to mediate their orientation towards disruption of the water surface. Through experimentation, Soares has demonstrated that DPRs on croc skin are stimulated by surface waves, which, when covered, remove the animal’s orienting behavior. Additionally, osteological markings of DPRs in the form of foramina have been found on the aforementioned fossil materials, suggesting that these receptors are a unique and conserved feature of semi-aquatic crocodilians.\n\n(8). Semi-aquatic crocodilians are fascinating in terms of their behavioral, physiological, and structural adaptations; however, they are also aggressive beasts capable of evoking terror in unsuspecting creatures. Humans are not necessarily targeted by crocodiles, but owing to the fact that crocodiles are opportunistic predators, any moving creature is fair game. One such example occurred around 7 a.m. on July 22, 2016, when a 59-year-old man named Jon Becker finished surfing off of Tamarindo’s Playa Grande, located on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Becker placed his foot in the Playa Grande Estuary, but before he could hop on to his surfboard to paddle across, his leg was clamped down upon by a crocodile. Fortunately for Becker, a lifeguard and a friend rushed to his aid, helping to free him from the beast and return him to the shore. The doctors at the Enrique Baltodano Hospital in Liberia tried their best to save Becker’s life  and did so successfully, though at the cost of the man’s right leg, which had to be amputated below his knee. Becker’s crocodile encounter was the third of its kind in the Playa Grande Estuary since 2013, and reportedly the seventh attack in Costa Rica in the year 2016. Additionally, Costa Rica and Brazil tied for the most reported crocodile attacks in the Americas in 2016, according to a worldwide crocodilian attack database known as “ CrocBITE .”\n\n(9). Unfortunately, Costa Rica and Brazil are not the only places that have borne witness to crocodile attacks ; following a fatal crocodile attack in Queensland, Australia, local MP Bob Katter called for a crocodile hunt in early 2016. The request for the hunt was owing to the “unprecedented” numbers of crocs present in Queensland, and its purpose was to attain a balance back in nature. It should be noted that approximately fifteen people have been killed by crocs in Northern Australia in the last 10 years. In 2014 in particular, there was a record number of fatal croc attacks in NT. Consequently, the Federal Government has been pushing to “develop the north” and increase its human population. However, with increasing numbers of Australians living in crocodile territory, more attacks seem inevitable.\n\n(10). Crocodiles in Northern Australia are already unofficially being culled . The animals are trapped around Darwin, Katherine, and parts of Arnhem Land before being taken to a local croc farm for one of two purposes: breeding or butchering.\n\n(11). Every year, Hermès , a French manufacturer of high-fashion luxury goods, sells millions of dollars’ worth of croc handbags. In fact, some of the skin that is displayed on the catwalk can be traced back to the animals harvested from the Northern Territory (NT) wilderness of the Land Down Under before being matured on a Hermès-owned farm near the city of Darwin.\n\n(12). The most staunch and aggressive defenders of the wild crocs may be those who have a stake in their commercial exploitation, given that the growing leather industry depends on croc eggs harvested from the wild. In 2016, the NT Government announced a plan that would increase the annual quota of wild-harvested crocodile eggs to 90,000, thus effectively industrializing remote parts of NT and transforming them into breeding grounds for use in the fashion industry–supplying material to design everything from handbags to watch bands.\n\n(13). It has been more than ten years since the death of Steve Irwin, the gregarious Queenslander and popular TV crocodile hunter. Nowadays, there are similar figures such as Tommy Nichols, known as Darwin’s veteran eight-fingered croc catcher, or Graham Webb, a founder of the local croc-farming industry, as well as Mick Pitman, a former outlaw croc poacher. The aforementioned individuals proudly assume the collective title of being Irwin’s replacement, but there is a sharp distinction between these individuals and the legendary Irwin. The former are in it for the kill, not just for thrills.\n\n(14). Mick Pitman is often hired by cattle stations to deal with “problem crocs.” According to his line of logic, he does not see any harm in charging tourists large sums of money to kill the crocs he was going to kill in any case. This behaviour is something Irwin would have vehemently opposed, as evidenced by his family’s opposition to the practice.\n\n(15). Approximately four decades after it was almost declared extinct, the croc is an accepted icon, a symbol of the “territory lifestyle.” Although there is much fear and reverence for this gatekeeper of the wilderness, there is also a lot of commercialization and exploitation of its parts."

The most staunch and aggressive defenders of the wild crocs may be those who have a stake in their commercial exploitation, given that the growing leather industry depends on croc eggs harvested from the wild. In 2016, the NT Government announced a plan that would increase the annual quota of wild-harvested crocodile eggs to 90,000, thus effectively industrializing remote parts of NT and transforming them into breeding grounds for use in the fashion industry–supplying material to design everything from handbags to watch bands.\n\n(13). It has been more than ten years since the death of Steve Irwin, the gregarious Queenslander and popular TV crocodile hunter. Nowadays, there are similar figures such as Tommy Nichols, known as Darwin’s veteran eight-fingered croc catcher, or Graham Webb, a founder of the local croc-farming industry, as well as Mick Pitman, a former outlaw croc poacher. The aforementioned individuals proudly assume the collective title of being Irwin’s replacement, but there is a sharp distinction between these individuals and the legendary Irwin. The former are in it for the kill, not just for thrills.\n\n(14). Mick Pitman is often hired by cattle stations to deal with “problem crocs.” According to his line of logic, he does not see any harm in charging tourists large sums of money to kill the crocs he was going to kill in any case. This behaviour is something Irwin would have vehemently opposed, as evidenced by his family’s opposition to the practice.\n\n(15). Approximately four decades after it was almost declared extinct, the croc is an accepted icon, a symbol of the “territory lifestyle.” Although there is much fear and reverence for this gatekeeper of the wilderness, there is also a lot of commercialization and exploitation of its parts."

      "text": "(1). Crocodilians are ambush hunters . Ferocious reptiles, these animals wait half-submerged for land-bound prey to disturb the water surface. Additionally, they appear to have specialized sensory organs on their faces, which can detect silent ripples on the surface of the surrounding water, even in complete darkness. These specialized organs were previously known as “ integumentary sense organs” and were used to distinguish between the alligatorid and the crocodilian families. However, their function, innervation, and phylogenetic history remained unknown. A functionally descriptive name for these organs, as suggested by Soares, is now “dome pressure receptors'' or “ DPRs .”\n\n(2). DPRs , as the name suggests, are round, dome-like structures that lack the presence of pores or protruding hairs. The epidermis located immediately above them is 40% thinner, while the keratin layer is 60% thinner and is considered to be more compact. The faces of alligators are covered with these small, pigmented dome-shaped spots, which are typically 0.5 mm in diameter; it is estimated that thousands of such sensory organs stud the face of an alligator. The distribution of these domes on the alligator’s exterior resembles that of a beard; however, it is also important to note that they are present on the inside of the mouth as well. DPRs are additionally found in fossils dating from the Jurassic Period, suggesting that, alongside possessing an armoured exterior, these semi-aquatic predators had developed distinct tactile sensitivity many millions of years ago.\n\n(3). In behavioral trials, half-submerged alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) have been observed orienting themselves to single water droplets in total darkness and without the use of audition. This orienting behavior demonstrated by crocodiles has been deemed robust in literature. The behavioral response was either head-turning or a full-body lunge in the direction of the source. Notably, this occurred only when the alligators’ faces were positioned on the air-water interface, but such a response was absent in cases where their faces were completely submerged or, conversely, were entirely out of the water.\n\n(4). The highly branched nerve bundle driving the croc’s tactile sensitivity is located a dermal fold below each organ; known as the trigeminal nerve, it is the largest of the twelve cranial nerves in the alligator and is commonly abbreviated as “ CN V .” As it can transmit both sensory and motor information, it is referred to as a mixed cranial nerve . It is divided into three main branches: the ophthalmic, the maxillary, and the mandibular , and each division serves a distinct role. While the ophthalmic and the maxillary only transmit sensory information from the upper face, the mandibular division provides motor innervation to the jaw muscles and also transmits sensation from the mandible and the tongue. Several vertebrates evolved trigeminal nerve-based specialized sensory systems, such as electroreceptors in the platypus as well as infrared receptors in certain snake species.\n\n(5). In crocodilians, CN V roots arise from the brain at the lateral corner of the medulla oblongata, and exit the endocranial cavity via the trigeminal foramen , which is a short passageway or opening. From here, they enter a depression known as the “trigeminal fossa” also referred to as the “ Meckel’s cave, ” which is formed by the lateralsphenoid rostrally and the prootic caudally. This is the location where the trigeminal ganglion is located with the lateralsphenoid and prootic medially and the quadrate and pterygoid bones laterally. The ophthalmic branch exits rostrally from the trigeminal ganglion through its own trough in the laterospheoid; however, the maxillary and the mandibular branches arise from the lateral part of the ganglion, exiting the trigeminal fossa through the maxillomandibular foramen . Although the specific pathway of the mandibular nerve is understood and described in literature, it is nonetheless complex. It is of great significance to note that, after the mandibular nerve continues through the mandible, it emits several variable sized axons that penetrate the lateral surface of the dentary, which is the anterior surface of the teeth-bearing lower jaw. From there, the axons terminate in the integument as nerve endings as well as DPRs.\n\n(6). As described by Daphne Soares in Nature’s article, “An ancient sensory organ in crocodilians”, published in 2002, recordings from the trigeminal ganglion revealed that DPRs appear to be sensitive to surface waves that were created with a piezoelectric “poker”, a type of surface-wave generator. The aforementioned generator was composed of a sinusoidal-wave generator attached to a rod, which was in turn connected to a speaker. Surface waves induced a single spike phase locked to the stimulus, and an increase in the wave amplitude resulted in an increased probability of spike firing. In order to stimulate individual receptors along with the skin that lies between them, Soares opted for a blunt, closed capillary tube attached to a piezoelectric wafer, which served as the secondary stimulus. Soares’ observation was that, while under continuous pressure, the DPR responses adapted quickly. In particular, no response was observed when the skin between the DPRs was exposed to the same pressure that had evoked a response in the DPRs. This finding was consistent with the understanding that DPRs are responsible for detecting pressure waves linked to disruptions to the air-water interface. As a result, Soares suggests that DPRs are perhaps sensitive to pressure differences but not to particle motion.\n\n(7). According to behavioural, paleontological, anatomical, and physiological evidence, crocodilians-an ancient monophyletic group in existence since before even the time of dinosaurs -have evolved a remarkable sensory organ to mediate their orientation towards disruption of the water surface. Through experimentation, Soares has demonstrated that DPRs on croc skin are stimulated by surface waves, which, when covered, remove the animal’s orienting behavior. Additionally, osteological markings of DPRs in the form of foramina have been found on the aforementioned fossil materials, suggesting that these receptors are a unique and conserved feature of semi-aquatic crocodilians.\n\n(8). Semi-aquatic crocodilians are fascinating in terms of their behavioral, physiological, and structural adaptations; however, they are also aggressive beasts capable of evoking terror in unsuspecting creatures. Humans are not necessarily targeted by crocodiles, but owing to the fact that crocodiles are opportunistic predators, any moving creature is fair game. One such example occurred around 7 a.m. on July 22, 2016, when a 59-year-old man named Jon Becker finished surfing off of Tamarindo’s Playa Grande, located on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Becker placed his foot in the Playa Grande Estuary, but before he could hop on to his surfboard to paddle across, his leg was clamped down upon by a crocodile. Fortunately for Becker, a lifeguard and a friend rushed to his aid, helping to free him from the beast and return him to the shore. The doctors at the Enrique Baltodano Hospital in Liberia tried their best to save Becker’s life  and did so successfully, though at the cost of the man’s right leg, which had to be amputated below his knee. Becker’s crocodile encounter was the third of its kind in the Playa Grande Estuary since 2013, and reportedly the seventh attack in Costa Rica in the year 2016. Additionally, Costa Rica and Brazil tied for the most reported crocodile attacks in the Americas in 2016, according to a worldwide crocodilian attack database known as “ CrocBITE .”\n\n(9). Unfortunately, Costa Rica and Brazil are not the only places that have borne witness to crocodile attacks ; following a fatal crocodile attack in Queensland, Australia, local MP Bob Katter called for a crocodile hunt in early 2016. The request for the hunt was owing to the “unprecedented” numbers of crocs present in Queensland, and its purpose was to attain a balance back in nature. It should be noted that approximately fifteen people have been killed by crocs in Northern Australia in the last 10 years. In 2014 in particular, there was a record number of fatal croc attacks in NT. Consequently, the Federal Government has been pushing to “develop the north” and increase its human population. However, with increasing numbers of Australians living in crocodile territory, more attacks seem inevitable.\n\n(10). Crocodiles in Northern Australia are already unofficially being culled . The animals are trapped around Darwin, Katherine, and parts of Arnhem Land before being taken to a local croc farm for one of two purposes: breeding or butchering.\n\n(11). Every year, Hermès , a French manufacturer of high-fashion luxury goods, sells millions of dollars’ worth of croc handbags. In fact, some of the skin that is displayed on the catwalk can be traced back to the animals harvested from the Northern Territory (NT) wilderness of the Land Down Under before being matured on a Hermès-owned farm near the city of Darwin.\n\n(12).

      "text": "(1). Crocodilians are ambush hunters . Ferocious reptiles, these animals wait half-submerged for land-bound prey to disturb the water surface. Additionally, they appear to have specialized sensory organs on their faces, which can detect silent ripples on the surface of the surrounding water, even in complete darkness. These specialized organs were previously known as “ integumentary sense organs” and were used to distinguish between the alligatorid and the crocodilian families. However, their function, innervation, and phylogenetic history remained unknown. A functionally descriptive name for these organs, as suggested by Soares, is now “dome pressure receptors'' or “ DPRs .”\n\n(2). DPRs , as the name suggests, are round, dome-like structures that lack the presence of pores or protruding hairs. The epidermis located immediately above them is 40% thinner, while the keratin layer is 60% thinner and is considered to be more compact. The faces of alligators are covered with these small, pigmented dome-shaped spots, which are typically 0.5 mm in diameter; it is estimated that thousands of such sensory organs stud the face of an alligator. The distribution of these domes on the alligator’s exterior resembles that of a beard; however, it is also important to note that they are present on the inside of the mouth as well. DPRs are additionally found in fossils dating from the Jurassic Period, suggesting that, alongside possessing an armoured exterior, these semi-aquatic predators had developed distinct tactile sensitivity many millions of years ago.\n\n(3). In behavioral trials, half-submerged alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) have been observed orienting themselves to single water droplets in total darkness and without the use of audition. This orienting behavior demonstrated by crocodiles has been deemed robust in literature. The behavioral response was either head-turning or a full-body lunge in the direction of the source. Notably, this occurred only when the alligators’ faces were positioned on the air-water interface, but such a response was absent in cases where their faces were completely submerged or, conversely, were entirely out of the water.\n\n(4). The highly branched nerve bundle driving the croc’s tactile sensitivity is located a dermal fold below each organ; known as the trigeminal nerve, it is the largest of the twelve cranial nerves in the alligator and is commonly abbreviated as “ CN V .” As it can transmit both sensory and motor information, it is referred to as a mixed cranial nerve . It is divided into three main branches: the ophthalmic, the maxillary, and the mandibular , and each division serves a distinct role. While the ophthalmic and the maxillary only transmit sensory information from the upper face, the mandibular division provides motor innervation to the jaw muscles and also transmits sensation from the mandible and the tongue. Several vertebrates evolved trigeminal nerve-based specialized sensory systems, such as electroreceptors in the platypus as well as infrared receptors in certain snake species.\n\n(5). In crocodilians, CN V roots arise from the brain at the lateral corner of the medulla oblongata, and exit the endocranial cavity via the trigeminal foramen , which is a short passageway or opening. From here, they enter a depression known as the “trigeminal fossa” also referred to as the “ Meckel’s cave, ” which is formed by the lateralsphenoid rostrally and the prootic caudally. This is the location where the trigeminal ganglion is located with the lateralsphenoid and prootic medially and the quadrate and pterygoid bones laterally. The ophthalmic branch exits rostrally from the trigeminal ganglion through its own trough in the laterospheoid; however, the maxillary and the mandibular branches arise from the lateral part of the ganglion, exiting the trigeminal fossa through the maxillomandibular foramen . Although the specific pathway of the mandibular nerve is understood and described in literature, it is nonetheless complex. It is of great significance to note that, after the mandibular nerve continues through the mandible, it emits several variable sized axons that penetrate the lateral surface of the dentary, which is the anterior surface of the teeth-bearing lower jaw. From there, the axons terminate in the integument as nerve endings as well as DPRs.\n\n(6). As described by Daphne Soares in Nature’s article, “An ancient sensory organ in crocodilians”, published in 2002, recordings from the trigeminal ganglion revealed that DPRs appear to be sensitive to surface waves that were created with a piezoelectric “poker”, a type of surface-wave generator. The aforementioned generator was composed of a sinusoidal-wave generator attached to a rod, which was in turn connected to a speaker. Surface waves induced a single spike phase locked to the stimulus, and an increase in the wave amplitude resulted in an increased probability of spike firing. In order to stimulate individual receptors along with the skin that lies between them, Soares opted for a blunt, closed capillary tube attached to a piezoelectric wafer, which served as the secondary stimulus. Soares’ observation was that, while under continuous pressure, the DPR responses adapted quickly. In particular, no response was observed when the skin between the DPRs was exposed to the same pressure that had evoked a response in the DPRs. This finding was consistent with the understanding that DPRs are responsible for detecting pressure waves linked to disruptions to the air-water interface. As a result, Soares suggests that DPRs are perhaps sensitive to pressure differences but not to particle motion.\n\n(7). According to behavioural, paleontological, anatomical, and physiological evidence, crocodilians-an ancient monophyletic group in existence since before even the time of dinosaurs -have evolved a remarkable sensory organ to mediate their orientation towards disruption of the water surface. Through experimentation, Soares has demonstrated that DPRs on croc skin are stimulated by surface waves, which, when covered, remove the animal’s orienting behavior. Additionally, osteological markings of DPRs in the form of foramina have been found on the aforementioned fossil materials, suggesting that these receptors are a unique and conserved feature of semi-aquatic crocodilians.\n\n(8). Semi-aquatic crocodilians are fascinating in terms of their behavioral, physiological, and structural adaptations; however, they are also aggressive beasts capable of evoking terror in unsuspecting creatures. Humans are not necessarily targeted by crocodiles, but owing to the fact that crocodiles are opportunistic predators, any moving creature is fair game. One such example occurred around 7 a.m. on July 22, 2016, when a 59-year-old man named Jon Becker finished surfing off of Tamarindo’s Playa Grande, located on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Becker placed his foot in the Playa Grande Estuary, but before he could hop on to his surfboard to paddle across, his leg was clamped down upon by a crocodile. Fortunately for Becker, a lifeguard and a friend rushed to his aid, helping to free him from the beast and return him to the shore. The doctors at the Enrique Baltodano Hospital in Liberia tried their best to save Becker’s life  and did so successfully, though at the cost of the man’s right leg, which had to be amputated below his knee. Becker’s crocodile encounter was the third of its kind in the Playa Grande Estuary since 2013, and reportedly the seventh attack in Costa Rica in the year 2016. Additionally, Costa Rica and Brazil tied for the most reported crocodile attacks in the Americas in 2016, according to a worldwide crocodilian attack database known as “ CrocBITE .”\n\n(9). Unfortunately, Costa Rica and Brazil are not the only places that have borne witness to crocodile attacks ; following a fatal crocodile attack in Queensland, Australia, local MP Bob Katter called for a crocodile hunt in early 2016. The request for the hunt was owing to the “unprecedented” numbers of crocs present in Queensland, and its purpose was to attain a balance back in nature. It should be noted that approximately fifteen people have been killed by crocs in Northern Australia in the last 10 years. In 2014 in particular, there was a record number of fatal croc attacks in NT. Consequently, the Federal Government has been pushing to “develop the north” and increase its human population. However, with increasing numbers of Australians living in crocodile territory, more attacks seem inevitable.\n\n(10). Crocodiles in Northern Australia are already unofficially being culled . The animals are trapped around Darwin, Katherine, and parts of Arnhem Land before being taken to a local croc farm for one of two purposes: breeding or butchering.\n\n(11). Every year, Hermès , a French manufacturer of high-fashion luxury goods, sells millions of dollars’ worth of croc handbags. In fact, some of the skin that is displayed on the catwalk can be traced back to the animals harvested from the Northern Territory (NT) wilderness of the Land Down Under before being matured on a Hermès-owned farm near the city of Darwin.\n\n(12). The most staunch and aggressive defenders of the wild crocs may be those who have a stake in their commercial exploitation, given that the growing leather industry depends on croc eggs harvested from the wild. In 2016, the NT Government announced a plan that would increase the annual quota of wild-harvested crocodile eggs to 90,000, thus effectively industrializing remote parts of NT and transforming them into breeding grounds for use in the fashion industry–supplying material to design everything from handbags to watch bands.\n\n(13). It has been more than ten years since the death of Steve Irwin, the gregarious Queenslander and popular TV crocodile hunter. Nowadays, there are similar figures such as Tommy Nichols, known as Darwin’s veteran eight-fingered croc catcher, or Graham Webb, a founder of the local croc-farming industry, as well as Mick Pitman, a former outlaw croc poacher. The aforementioned individuals proudly assume the collective title of being Irwin’s replacement, but there is a sharp distinction between these individuals and the legendary Irwin. The former are in it for the kill, not just for thrills.\n\n(14). Mick Pitman is often hired by cattle stations to deal with “problem crocs.” According to his line of logic, he does not see any harm in charging tourists large sums of money to kill the crocs he was going to kill in any case. This behaviour is something Irwin would have vehemently opposed, as evidenced by his family’s opposition to the practice.\n\n(15). Approximately four decades after it was almost declared extinct, the croc is an accepted icon, a symbol of the “territory lifestyle.” Although there is much fear and reverence for this gatekeeper of the wilderness, there is also a lot of commercialization and exploitation of its parts."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should determine where in the passage the topic of each statement is discussed. If we consider that the first statement touches upon vertebrates that are not crocodiles and further note that the passage is largely centered around the topic of the latter, we can deduce that the section of the text mentioning non–crocodilians will be limited and likely contain all the information we are seeking in one section of the passage. Paragraph 4 states: “Several vertebrates evolved trigeminal nerve–based specialized sensory systems, such as electroreceptors in the platypus as well as infrared receptors in certain snake species.” This tells us that the first statement is FALSE, since the text states that several, not few, vertebrates developed trigeminal nerve–based specialized sensory systems. If we now consider the second statement, we can see that it discusses the trapping of crocodiles. A brief scan of the text tells us that the topic of human interactions with crocodiles is discussed starting in paragraph eight and carries on until the close of the text. If we now scan the above–mentioned paragraphs, we will find the information we are seeking. Paragraph 10 states: “Crocodiles in Northern Australia are already unofficially being culled. The animals are trapped around Darwin, Katherine, and parts of Arnhem Land before being taken to a local croc farm for one of two purposes: breeding or butchering.” This tells us that crocs are being trapped in Darwin, Katherine, and parts of Arnhem Land, but there is no mention of Queensland in this particular portion of the text.

From here, they enter a depression known as the “trigeminal fossa” also referred to as the “ Meckel’s cave, ” which is formed by the lateralsphenoid rostrally and the prootic caudally. This is the location where the trigeminal ganglion is located with the lateralsphenoid and prootic medially and the quadrate and pterygoid bones laterally.

Although the specific pathway of the mandibular nerve is understood and described in literature, it is nonetheless complex. It is of great significance to note that, after the mandibular nerve continues through the mandible, it emits several variable sized axons that penetrate the lateral surface of the dentary, which is the anterior surface of the teeth-bearing lower jaw. From there, the axons terminate in the integument as nerve endings as well as DPRs.\n\n(6). As described by Daphne Soares in Nature’s article, “An ancient sensory organ in crocodilians”, published in 2002, recordings from the trigeminal ganglion revealed that DPRs appear to be sensitive to surface waves that were created with a piezoelectric “poker”, a type of surface-wave generator. The aforementioned generator was composed of a sinusoidal-wave generator attached to a rod, which was in turn connected to a speaker. Surface waves induced a single spike phase locked to the stimulus, and an increase in the wave amplitude resulted in an increased probability of spike firing. In order to stimulate individual receptors along with the skin that lies between them, Soares opted for a blunt, closed capillary tube attached to a piezoelectric wafer, which served as the secondary stimulus. Soares’ observation was that, while under continuous pressure, the DPR responses adapted quickly. In particular, no response was observed when the skin between the DPRs was exposed to the same pressure that had evoked a response in the DPRs. This finding was consistent with the understanding that DPRs are responsible for detecting pressure waves linked to disruptions to the air-water interface. As a result, Soares suggests that DPRs are perhaps sensitive to pressure differences but not to particle motion.\n\n(7). According to behavioural, paleontological, anatomical, and physiological evidence, crocodilians-an ancient monophyletic group in existence since before even the time of dinosaurs -have evolved a remarkable sensory organ to mediate their orientation towards disruption of the water surface. Through experimentation, Soares has demonstrated that DPRs on croc skin are stimulated by surface waves, which, when covered, remove the animal’s orienting behavior. Additionally, osteological markings of DPRs in the form of foramina have been found on the aforementioned fossil materials, suggesting that these receptors are a unique and conserved feature of semi-aquatic crocodilians.\n\n(8). Semi-aquatic crocodilians are fascinating in terms of their behavioral, physiological, and structural adaptations; however, they are also aggressive beasts capable of evoking terror in unsuspecting creatures. Humans are not necessarily targeted by crocodiles, but owing to the fact that crocodiles are opportunistic predators, any moving creature is fair game. One such example occurred around 7 a.m. on July 22, 2016, when a 59-year-old man named Jon Becker finished surfing off of Tamarindo’s Playa Grande, located on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Becker placed his foot in the Playa Grande Estuary, but before he could hop on to his surfboard to paddle across, his leg was clamped down upon by a crocodile. Fortunately for Becker, a lifeguard and a friend rushed to his aid, helping to free him from the beast and return him to the shore. The doctors at the Enrique Baltodano Hospital in Liberia tried their best to save Becker’s life  and did so successfully, though at the cost of the man’s right leg, which had to be amputated below his knee. Becker’s crocodile encounter was the third of its kind in the Playa Grande Estuary since 2013, and reportedly the seventh attack in Costa Rica in the year 2016. Additionally, Costa Rica and Brazil tied for the most reported crocodile attacks in the Americas in 2016, according to a worldwide crocodilian attack database known as “ CrocBITE .”\n\n(9). Unfortunately, Costa Rica and Brazil are not the only places that have borne witness to crocodile attacks ; following a fatal crocodile attack in Queensland, Australia, local MP Bob Katter called for a crocodile hunt in early 2016. The request for the hunt was owing to the “unprecedented” numbers of crocs present in Queensland, and its purpose was to attain a balance back in nature. It should be noted that approximately fifteen people have been killed by crocs in Northern Australia in the last 10 years. In 2014 in particular, there was a record number of fatal croc attacks in NT. Consequently, the Federal Government has been pushing to “develop the north” and increase its human population. However, with increasing numbers of Australians living in crocodile territory, more attacks seem inevitable.\n\n(10). Crocodiles in Northern Australia are already unofficially being culled . The animals are trapped around Darwin, Katherine, and parts of Arnhem Land before being taken to a local croc farm for one of two purposes: breeding or butchering.\n\n(11). Every year, Hermès , a French manufacturer of high-fashion luxury goods, sells millions of dollars’ worth of croc handbags. In fact, some of the skin that is displayed on the catwalk can be traced back to the animals harvested from the Northern Territory (NT) wilderness of the Land Down Under before being matured on a Hermès-owned farm near the city of Darwin.\n\n(12). The most staunch and aggressive defenders of the wild crocs may be those who have a stake in their commercial exploitation, given that the growing leather industry depends on croc eggs harvested from the wild. In 2016, the NT Government announced a plan that would increase the annual quota of wild-harvested crocodile eggs to 90,000, thus effectively industrializing remote parts of NT and transforming them into breeding grounds for use in the fashion industry–supplying material to design everything from handbags to watch bands.\n\n(13). It has been more than ten years since the death of Steve Irwin, the gregarious Queenslander and popular TV crocodile hunter. Nowadays, there are similar figures such as Tommy Nichols, known as Darwin’s veteran eight-fingered croc catcher, or Graham Webb, a founder of the local croc-farming industry, as well as Mick Pitman, a former outlaw croc poacher. The aforementioned individuals proudly assume the collective title of being Irwin’s replacement, but there is a sharp distinction between these individuals and the legendary Irwin. The former are in it for the kill, not just for thrills.\n\n(14). Mick Pitman is often hired by cattle stations to deal with “problem crocs.” According to his line of logic, he does not see any harm in charging tourists large sums of money to kill the crocs he was going to kill in any case. This behaviour is something Irwin would have vehemently opposed, as evidenced by his family’s opposition to the practice.\n\n(15). Approximately four decades after it was almost declared extinct, the croc is an accepted icon, a symbol of the “territory lifestyle.” Although there is much fear and reverence for this gatekeeper of the wilderness, there is also a lot of commercialization and exploitation of its parts."

      "text": "(1). Crocodilians are ambush hunters . Ferocious reptiles, these animals wait half-submerged for land-bound prey to disturb the water surface. Additionally, they appear to have specialized sensory organs on their faces, which can detect silent ripples on the surface of the surrounding water, even in complete darkness. These specialized organs were previously known as “ integumentary sense organs” and were used to distinguish between the alligatorid and the crocodilian families. However, their function, innervation, and phylogenetic history remained unknown. A functionally descriptive name for these organs, as suggested by Soares, is now “dome pressure receptors'' or “ DPRs .”\n\n(2). DPRs , as the name suggests, are round, dome-like structures that lack the presence of pores or protruding hairs. The epidermis located immediately above them is 40% thinner, while the keratin layer is 60% thinner and is considered to be more compact. The faces of alligators are covered with these small, pigmented dome-shaped spots, which are typically 0.5 mm in diameter; it is estimated that thousands of such sensory organs stud the face of an alligator. The distribution of these domes on the alligator’s exterior resembles that of a beard; however, it is also important to note that they are present on the inside of the mouth as well. DPRs are additionally found in fossils dating from the Jurassic Period, suggesting that, alongside possessing an armoured exterior, these semi-aquatic predators had developed distinct tactile sensitivity many millions of years ago.\n\n(3). In behavioral trials, half-submerged alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) have been observed orienting themselves to single water droplets in total darkness and without the use of audition. This orienting behavior demonstrated by crocodiles has been deemed robust in literature. The behavioral response was either head-turning or a full-body lunge in the direction of the source. Notably, this occurred only when the alligators’ faces were positioned on the air-water interface, but such a response was absent in cases where their faces were completely submerged or, conversely, were entirely out of the water.\n\n(4). The highly branched nerve bundle driving the croc’s tactile sensitivity is located a dermal fold below each organ; known as the trigeminal nerve, it is the largest of the twelve cranial nerves in the alligator and is commonly abbreviated as “ CN V .” As it can transmit both sensory and motor information, it is referred to as a mixed cranial nerve . It is divided into three main branches: the ophthalmic, the maxillary, and the mandibular , and each division serves a distinct role. While the ophthalmic and the maxillary only transmit sensory information from the upper face, the mandibular division provides motor innervation to the jaw muscles and also transmits sensation from the mandible and the tongue. Several vertebrates evolved trigeminal nerve-based specialized sensory systems, such as electroreceptors in the platypus as well as infrared receptors in certain snake species.\n\n(5). In crocodilians, CN V roots arise from the brain at the lateral corner of the medulla oblongata, and exit the endocranial cavity via the trigeminal foramen , which is a short passageway or opening. From here, they enter a depression known as the “trigeminal fossa” also referred to as the “ Meckel’s cave, ” which is formed by the lateralsphenoid rostrally and the prootic caudally. This is the location where the trigeminal ganglion is located with the lateralsphenoid and prootic medially and the quadrate and pterygoid bones laterally. The ophthalmic branch exits rostrally from the trigeminal ganglion through its own trough in the laterospheoid; however, the maxillary and the mandibular branches arise from the lateral part of the ganglion, exiting the trigeminal fossa through the maxillomandibular foramen . Although the specific pathway of the mandibular nerve is understood and described in literature, it is nonetheless complex. It is of great significance to note that, after the mandibular nerve continues through the mandible, it emits several variable sized axons that penetrate the lateral surface of the dentary, which is the anterior surface of the teeth-bearing lower jaw. From there, the axons terminate in the integument as nerve endings as well as DPRs.\n\n(6).

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should first determine wherein in the passage the phrase “develop the north” is mentioned. If we note that human interactions with crocodiles are discussed starting in paragraph eight, we can read on from here to determine that the phrase “develop the north” is located in the following paragraph. Paragraph 9 states: “It should be noted that approximately fifteen people have been killed by crocs in Northern Australia in the last 10 years. In 2014 in particular, there was a record number of fatal croc attacks in NT. Consequently, the Federal Government has been pushing to “develop the north” and increase its human population. However, with increasing numbers of Australians living in crocodile territory, more attacks seem inevitable.” If we note the use of the word “however,” succeeding the description of the government’s plan to “develop the north,” we can see that the author raises concerns about a rise in crocodile attacks.” Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",

      "text": "(1). Crocodilians are ambush hunters . Ferocious reptiles, these animals wait half-submerged for land-bound prey to disturb the water surface. Additionally, they appear to have specialized sensory organs on their faces, which can detect silent ripples on the surface of the surrounding water, even in complete darkness. These specialized organs were previously known as “ integumentary sense organs” and were used to distinguish between the alligatorid and the crocodilian families. However, their function, innervation, and phylogenetic history remained unknown. A functionally descriptive name for these organs, as suggested by Soares, is now “dome pressure receptors'' or “ DPRs .”\n\n(2). DPRs , as the name suggests, are round, dome-like structures that lack the presence of pores or protruding hairs. The epidermis located immediately above them is 40% thinner, while the keratin layer is 60% thinner and is considered to be more compact. The faces of alligators are covered with these small, pigmented dome-shaped spots, which are typically 0.5 mm in diameter; it is estimated that thousands of such sensory organs stud the face of an alligator. The distribution of these domes on the alligator’s exterior resembles that of a beard; however, it is also important to note that they are present on the inside of the mouth as well. DPRs are additionally found in fossils dating from the Jurassic Period, suggesting that, alongside possessing an armoured exterior, these semi-aquatic predators had developed distinct tactile sensitivity many millions of years ago.\n\n(3). In behavioral trials, half-submerged alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) have been observed orienting themselves to single water droplets in total darkness and without the use of audition. This orienting behavior demonstrated by crocodiles has been deemed robust in literature. The behavioral response was either head-turning or a full-body lunge in the direction of the source. Notably, this occurred only when the alligators’ faces were positioned on the air-water interface, but such a response was absent in cases where their faces were completely submerged or, conversely, were entirely out of the water.\n\n(4). The highly branched nerve bundle driving the croc’s tactile sensitivity is located a dermal fold below each organ; known as the trigeminal nerve, it is the largest of the twelve cranial nerves in the alligator and is commonly abbreviated as “ CN V .” As it can transmit both sensory and motor information, it is referred to as a mixed cranial nerve . It is divided into three main branches: the ophthalmic, the maxillary, and the mandibular , and each division serves a distinct role. While the ophthalmic and the maxillary only transmit sensory information from the upper face, the mandibular division provides motor innervation to the jaw muscles and also transmits sensation from the mandible and the tongue. Several vertebrates evolved trigeminal nerve-based specialized sensory systems, such as electroreceptors in the platypus as well as infrared receptors in certain snake species.\n\n(5). In crocodilians, CN V roots arise from the brain at the lateral corner of the medulla oblongata, and exit the endocranial cavity via the trigeminal foramen , which is a short passageway or opening. From here, they enter a depression known as the “trigeminal fossa” also referred to as the “ Meckel’s cave, ” which is formed by the lateralsphenoid rostrally and the prootic caudally. This is the location where the trigeminal ganglion is located with the lateralsphenoid and prootic medially and the quadrate and pterygoid bones laterally. The ophthalmic branch exits rostrally from the trigeminal ganglion through its own trough in the laterospheoid; however, the maxillary and the mandibular branches arise from the lateral part of the ganglion, exiting the trigeminal fossa through the maxillomandibular foramen . Although the specific pathway of the mandibular nerve is understood and described in literature, it is nonetheless complex. It is of great significance to note that, after the mandibular nerve continues through the mandible, it emits several variable sized axons that penetrate the lateral surface of the dentary, which is the anterior surface of the teeth-bearing lower jaw. From there, the axons terminate in the integument as nerve endings as well as DPRs.\n\n(6). As described by Daphne Soares in Nature’s article, “An ancient sensory organ in crocodilians”, published in 2002, recordings from the trigeminal ganglion revealed that DPRs appear to be sensitive to surface waves that were created with a piezoelectric “poker”, a type of surface-wave generator. The aforementioned generator was composed of a sinusoidal-wave generator attached to a rod, which was in turn connected to a speaker. Surface waves induced a single spike phase locked to the stimulus, and an increase in the wave amplitude resulted in an increased probability of spike firing. In order to stimulate individual receptors along with the skin that lies between them, Soares opted for a blunt, closed capillary tube attached to a piezoelectric wafer, which served as the secondary stimulus. Soares’ observation was that, while under continuous pressure, the DPR responses adapted quickly. In particular, no response was observed when the skin between the DPRs was exposed to the same pressure that had evoked a response in the DPRs. This finding was consistent with the understanding that DPRs are responsible for detecting pressure waves linked to disruptions to the air-water interface. As a result, Soares suggests that DPRs are perhaps sensitive to pressure differences but not to particle motion.\n\n(7). According to behavioural, paleontological, anatomical, and physiological evidence, crocodilians-an ancient monophyletic group in existence since before even the time of dinosaurs -have evolved a remarkable sensory organ to mediate their orientation towards disruption of the water surface. Through experimentation, Soares has demonstrated that DPRs on croc skin are stimulated by surface waves, which, when covered, remove the animal’s orienting behavior. Additionally, osteological markings of DPRs in the form of foramina have been found on the aforementioned fossil materials, suggesting that these receptors are a unique and conserved feature of semi-aquatic crocodilians.\n\n(8). Semi-aquatic crocodilians are fascinating in terms of their behavioral, physiological, and structural adaptations; however, they are also aggressive beasts capable of evoking terror in unsuspecting creatures. Humans are not necessarily targeted by crocodiles, but owing to the fact that crocodiles are opportunistic predators, any moving creature is fair game. One such example occurred around 7 a.m. on July 22, 2016, when a 59-year-old man named Jon Becker finished surfing off of Tamarindo’s Playa Grande, located on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Becker placed his foot in the Playa Grande Estuary, but before he could hop on to his surfboard to paddle across, his leg was clamped down upon by a crocodile. Fortunately for Becker, a lifeguard and a friend rushed to his aid, helping to free him from the beast and return him to the shore. The doctors at the Enrique Baltodano Hospital in Liberia tried their best to save Becker’s life  and did so successfully, though at the cost of the man’s right leg, which had to be amputated below his knee. Becker’s crocodile encounter was the third of its kind in the Playa Grande Estuary since 2013, and reportedly the seventh attack in Costa Rica in the year 2016. Additionally, Costa Rica and Brazil tied for the most reported crocodile attacks in the Americas in 2016, according to a worldwide crocodilian attack database known as “ CrocBITE .”\n\n(9). Unfortunately, Costa Rica and Brazil are not the only places that have borne witness to crocodile attacks ; following a fatal crocodile attack in Queensland, Australia, local MP Bob Katter called for a crocodile hunt in early 2016. The request for the hunt was owing to the “unprecedented” numbers of crocs present in Queensland, and its purpose was to attain a balance back in nature. It should be noted that approximately fifteen people have been killed by crocs in Northern Australia in the last 10 years. In 2014 in particular, there was a record number of fatal croc attacks in NT. Consequently, the Federal Government has been pushing to “develop the north” and increase its human population. However, with increasing numbers of Australians living in crocodile territory, more attacks seem inevitable.\n\n(10). Crocodiles in Northern Australia are already unofficially being culled . The animals are trapped around Darwin, Katherine, and parts of Arnhem Land before being taken to a local croc farm for one of two purposes: breeding or butchering.\n\n(11). Every year, Hermès , a French manufacturer of high-fashion luxury goods, sells millions of dollars’ worth of croc handbags. In fact, some of the skin that is displayed on the catwalk can be traced back to the animals harvested from the Northern Territory (NT) wilderness of the Land Down Under before being matured on a Hermès-owned farm near the city of Darwin.\n\n(12). The most staunch and aggressive defenders of the wild crocs may be those who have a stake in their commercial exploitation, given that the growing leather industry depends on croc eggs harvested from the wild. In 2016, the NT Government announced a plan that would increase the annual quota of wild-harvested crocodile eggs to 90,000, thus effectively industrializing remote parts of NT and transforming them into breeding grounds for use in the fashion industry–supplying material to design everything from handbags to watch bands.\n\n(13). It has been more than ten years since the death of Steve Irwin, the gregarious Queenslander and popular TV crocodile hunter. Nowadays, there are similar figures such as Tommy Nichols, known as Darwin’s veteran eight-fingered croc catcher, or Graham Webb, a founder of the local croc-farming industry, as well as Mick Pitman, a former outlaw croc poacher. The aforementioned individuals proudly assume the collective title of being Irwin’s replacement, but there is a sharp distinction between these individuals and the legendary Irwin. The former are in it for the kill, not just for thrills.\n\n(14). Mick Pitman is often hired by cattle stations to deal with “problem crocs.” According to his line of logic, he does not see any harm in charging tourists large sums of money to kill the crocs he was going to kill in any case. This behaviour is something Irwin would have vehemently opposed, as evidenced by his family’s opposition to the practice.\n\n(15). Approximately four decades after it was almost declared extinct, the croc is an accepted icon, a symbol of the “territory lifestyle.” Although there is much fear and reverence for this gatekeeper of the wilderness, there is also a lot of commercialization and exploitation of its parts."

These specialized organs were previously known as “ integumentary sense organs” and were used to distinguish between the alligatorid and the crocodilian families. However, their function, innervation, and phylogenetic history remained unknown. A functionally descriptive name for these organs, as suggested by Soares, is now “dome pressure receptors'' or “ DPRs .”\n\n(2). DPRs , as the name suggests, are round, dome-like structures that lack the presence of pores or protruding hairs. The epidermis located immediately above them is 40% thinner, while the keratin layer is 60% thinner and is considered to be more compact. The faces of alligators are covered with these small, pigmented dome-shaped spots, which are typically 0.5 mm in diameter; it is estimated that thousands of such sensory organs stud the face of an alligator. The distribution of these domes on the alligator’s exterior resembles that of a beard; however, it is also important to note that they are present on the inside of the mouth as well. DPRs are additionally found in fossils dating from the Jurassic Period, suggesting that, alongside possessing an armoured exterior, these semi-aquatic predators had developed distinct tactile sensitivity many millions of years ago.\n\n(3). In behavioral trials, half-submerged alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) have been observed orienting themselves to single water droplets in total darkness and without the use of audition. This orienting behavior demonstrated by crocodiles has been deemed robust in literature. The behavioral response was either head-turning or a full-body lunge in the direction of the source. Notably, this occurred only when the alligators’ faces were positioned on the air-water interface, but such a response was absent in cases where their faces were completely submerged or, conversely, were entirely out of the water.\n\n(4). The highly branched nerve bundle driving the croc’s tactile sensitivity is located a dermal fold below each organ; known as the trigeminal nerve, it is the largest of the twelve cranial nerves in the alligator and is commonly abbreviated as “ CN V .” As it can transmit both sensory and motor information, it is referred to as a mixed cranial nerve . It is divided into three main branches: the ophthalmic, the maxillary, and the mandibular , and each division serves a distinct role. While the ophthalmic and the maxillary only transmit sensory information from the upper face, the mandibular division provides motor innervation to the jaw muscles and also transmits sensation from the mandible and the tongue. Several vertebrates evolved trigeminal nerve-based specialized sensory systems, such as electroreceptors in the platypus as well as infrared receptors in certain snake species.\n\n(5). In crocodilians, CN V roots arise from the brain at the lateral corner of the medulla oblongata, and exit the endocranial cavity via the trigeminal foramen , which is a short passageway or opening. From here, they enter a depression known as the “trigeminal fossa” also referred to as the “ Meckel’s cave, ” which is formed by the lateralsphenoid rostrally and the prootic caudally. This is the location where the trigeminal ganglion is located with the lateralsphenoid and prootic medially and the quadrate and pterygoid bones laterally. The ophthalmic branch exits rostrally from the trigeminal ganglion through its own trough in the laterospheoid; however, the maxillary and the mandibular branches arise from the lateral part of the ganglion, exiting the trigeminal fossa through the maxillomandibular foramen . Although the specific pathway of the mandibular nerve is understood and described in literature, it is nonetheless complex. It is of great significance to note that, after the mandibular nerve continues through the mandible, it emits several variable sized axons that penetrate the lateral surface of the dentary, which is the anterior surface of the teeth-bearing lower jaw. From there, the axons terminate in the integument as nerve endings as well as DPRs.\n\n(6). As described by Daphne Soares in Nature’s article, “An ancient sensory organ in crocodilians”, published in 2002, recordings from the trigeminal ganglion revealed that DPRs appear to be sensitive to surface waves that were created with a piezoelectric “poker”, a type of surface-wave generator. The aforementioned generator was composed of a sinusoidal-wave generator attached to a rod, which was in turn connected to a speaker. Surface waves induced a single spike phase locked to the stimulus, and an increase in the wave amplitude resulted in an increased probability of spike firing. In order to stimulate individual receptors along with the skin that lies between them, Soares opted for a blunt, closed capillary tube attached to a piezoelectric wafer, which served as the secondary stimulus. Soares’ observation was that, while under continuous pressure, the DPR responses adapted quickly. In particular, no response was observed when the skin between the DPRs was exposed to the same pressure that had evoked a response in the DPRs. This finding was consistent with the understanding that DPRs are responsible for detecting pressure waves linked to disruptions to the air-water interface. As a result, Soares suggests that DPRs are perhaps sensitive to pressure differences but not to particle motion.\n\n(7). According to behavioural, paleontological, anatomical, and physiological evidence, crocodilians-an ancient monophyletic group in existence since before even the time of dinosaurs -have evolved a remarkable sensory organ to mediate their orientation towards disruption of the water surface. Through experimentation, Soares has demonstrated that DPRs on croc skin are stimulated by surface waves, which, when covered, remove the animal’s orienting behavior. Additionally, osteological markings of DPRs in the form of foramina have been found on the aforementioned fossil materials, suggesting that these receptors are a unique and conserved feature of semi-aquatic crocodilians.\n\n(8). Semi-aquatic crocodilians are fascinating in terms of their behavioral, physiological, and structural adaptations; however, they are also aggressive beasts capable of evoking terror in unsuspecting creatures. Humans are not necessarily targeted by crocodiles, but owing to the fact that crocodiles are opportunistic predators, any moving creature is fair game. One such example occurred around 7 a.m. on July 22, 2016, when a 59-year-old man named Jon Becker finished surfing off of Tamarindo’s Playa Grande, located on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Becker placed his foot in the Playa Grande Estuary, but before he could hop on to his surfboard to paddle across, his leg was clamped down upon by a crocodile. Fortunately for Becker, a lifeguard and a friend rushed to his aid, helping to free him from the beast and return him to the shore. The doctors at the Enrique Baltodano Hospital in Liberia tried their best to save Becker’s life  and did so successfully, though at the cost of the man’s right leg, which had to be amputated below his knee. Becker’s crocodile encounter was the third of its kind in the Playa Grande Estuary since 2013, and reportedly the seventh attack in Costa Rica in the year 2016. Additionally, Costa Rica and Brazil tied for the most reported crocodile attacks in the Americas in 2016, according to a worldwide crocodilian attack database known as “ CrocBITE .”\n\n(9). Unfortunately, Costa Rica and Brazil are not the only places that have borne witness to crocodile attacks ; following a fatal crocodile attack in Queensland, Australia, local MP Bob Katter called for a crocodile hunt in early 2016. The request for the hunt was owing to the “unprecedented” numbers of crocs present in Queensland, and its purpose was to attain a balance back in nature. It should be noted that approximately fifteen people have been killed by crocs in Northern Australia in the last 10 years. In 2014 in particular, there was a record number of fatal croc attacks in NT. Consequently, the Federal Government has been pushing to “develop the north” and increase its human population. However, with increasing numbers of Australians living in crocodile territory, more attacks seem inevitable.\n\n(10). Crocodiles in Northern Australia are already unofficially being culled . The animals are trapped around Darwin, Katherine, and parts of Arnhem Land before being taken to a local croc farm for one of two purposes: breeding or butchering.\n\n(11). Every year, Hermès , a French manufacturer of high-fashion luxury goods, sells millions of dollars’ worth of croc handbags. In fact, some of the skin that is displayed on the catwalk can be traced back to the animals harvested from the Northern Territory (NT) wilderness of the Land Down Under before being matured on a Hermès-owned farm near the city of Darwin.\n\n(12). The most staunch and aggressive defenders of the wild crocs may be those who have a stake in their commercial exploitation, given that the growing leather industry depends on croc eggs harvested from the wild. In 2016, the NT Government announced a plan that would increase the annual quota of wild-harvested crocodile eggs to 90,000, thus effectively industrializing remote parts of NT and transforming them into breeding grounds for use in the fashion industry–supplying material to design everything from handbags to watch bands.\n\n(13). It has been more than ten years since the death of Steve Irwin, the gregarious Queenslander and popular TV crocodile hunter. Nowadays, there are similar figures such as Tommy Nichols, known as Darwin’s veteran eight-fingered croc catcher, or Graham Webb, a founder of the local croc-farming industry, as well as Mick Pitman, a former outlaw croc poacher. The aforementioned individuals proudly assume the collective title of being Irwin’s replacement, but there is a sharp distinction between these individuals and the legendary Irwin. The former are in it for the kill, not just for thrills.\n\n(14). Mick Pitman is often hired by cattle stations to deal with “problem crocs.” According to his line of logic, he does not see any harm in charging tourists large sums of money to kill the crocs he was going to kill in any case. This behaviour is something Irwin would have vehemently opposed, as evidenced by his family’s opposition to the practice.\n\n(15). Approximately four decades after it was almost declared extinct, the croc is an accepted icon, a symbol of the “territory lifestyle.” Although there is much fear and reverence for this gatekeeper of the wilderness, there is also a lot of commercialization and exploitation of its parts."

If we note that the corroboration of Soares’ research is not mentioned in the passage, we can eliminate the first option. If we then recall that paragraph 2 states the distribution of DPRs resembles a beard and not a mustache, and further recollect that the author asserts that the Australian government has done the opposite of protecting the Alligator mississippiensis by supporting the breeding of these animals for the purpose of butchering, as per paragraph 12, we can conclude that the final answer choice is the only option that contains a statement acknowledged by the author. Paragraph 15 states: “Approximately four decades after it was almost declared extinct, the croc is an accepted icon, a symbol of the “territory lifestyle.” Although there is much fear and reverence for this gatekeeper of the wilderness, there is also a lot of commercialization and exploitation of its parts.” Referring to the above paragraph, we can conclude that the author acknowledges both the symbolism of the crocodile as an icon of the territory lifestyle and also acknowledges that the animal has been exploited and commercialized. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",

As described by Daphne Soares in Nature’s article, “An ancient sensory organ in crocodilians”, published in 2002, recordings from the trigeminal ganglion revealed that DPRs appear to be sensitive to surface waves that were created with a piezoelectric “poker”, a type of surface-wave generator.

Soares’ observation was that, while under continuous pressure, the DPR responses adapted quickly. In particular, no response was observed when the skin between the DPRs was exposed to the same pressure that had evoked a response in the DPRs. This finding was consistent with the understanding that DPRs are responsible for detecting pressure waves linked to disruptions to the air-water interface. As a result, Soares suggests that DPRs are perhaps sensitive to pressure differences but not to particle motion.\n\n(7). According to behavioural, paleontological, anatomical, and physiological evidence, crocodilians-an ancient monophyletic group in existence since before even the time of dinosaurs -have evolved a remarkable sensory organ to mediate their orientation towards disruption of the water surface. Through experimentation, Soares has demonstrated that DPRs on croc skin are stimulated by surface waves, which, when covered, remove the animal’s orienting behavior. Additionally, osteological markings of DPRs in the form of foramina have been found on the aforementioned fossil materials, suggesting that these receptors are a unique and conserved feature of semi-aquatic crocodilians.\n\n(8). Semi-aquatic crocodilians are fascinating in terms of their behavioral, physiological, and structural adaptations; however, they are also aggressive beasts capable of evoking terror in unsuspecting creatures. Humans are not necessarily targeted by crocodiles, but owing to the fact that crocodiles are opportunistic predators, any moving creature is fair game. One such example occurred around 7 a.m. on July 22, 2016, when a 59-year-old man named Jon Becker finished surfing off of Tamarindo’s Playa Grande, located on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Becker placed his foot in the Playa Grande Estuary, but before he could hop on to his surfboard to paddle across, his leg was clamped down upon by a crocodile. Fortunately for Becker, a lifeguard and a friend rushed to his aid, helping to free him from the beast and return him to the shore. The doctors at the Enrique Baltodano Hospital in Liberia tried their best to save Becker’s life  and did so successfully, though at the cost of the man’s right leg, which had to be amputated below his knee. Becker’s crocodile encounter was the third of its kind in the Playa Grande Estuary since 2013, and reportedly the seventh attack in Costa Rica in the year 2016. Additionally, Costa Rica and Brazil tied for the most reported crocodile attacks in the Americas in 2016, according to a worldwide crocodilian attack database known as “ CrocBITE .”\n\n(9). Unfortunately, Costa Rica and Brazil are not the only places that have borne witness to crocodile attacks ; following a fatal crocodile attack in Queensland, Australia, local MP Bob Katter called for a crocodile hunt in early 2016. The request for the hunt was owing to the “unprecedented” numbers of crocs present in Queensland, and its purpose was to attain a balance back in nature. It should be noted that approximately fifteen people have been killed by crocs in Northern Australia in the last 10 years. In 2014 in particular, there was a record number of fatal croc attacks in NT. Consequently, the Federal Government has been pushing to “develop the north” and increase its human population. However, with increasing numbers of Australians living in crocodile territory, more attacks seem inevitable.\n\n(10). Crocodiles in Northern Australia are already unofficially being culled . The animals are trapped around Darwin, Katherine, and parts of Arnhem Land before being taken to a local croc farm for one of two purposes: breeding or butchering.\n\n(11). Every year, Hermès , a French manufacturer of high-fashion luxury goods, sells millions of dollars’ worth of croc handbags. In fact, some of the skin that is displayed on the catwalk can be traced back to the animals harvested from the Northern Territory (NT) wilderness of the Land Down Under before being matured on a Hermès-owned farm near the city of Darwin.\n\n(12). The most staunch and aggressive defenders of the wild crocs may be those who have a stake in their commercial exploitation, given that the growing leather industry depends on croc eggs harvested from the wild. In 2016, the NT Government announced a plan that would increase the annual quota of wild-harvested crocodile eggs to 90,000, thus effectively industrializing remote parts of NT and transforming them into breeding grounds for use in the fashion industry–supplying material to design everything from handbags to watch bands.\n\n(13). It has been more than ten years since the death of Steve Irwin, the gregarious Queenslander and popular TV crocodile hunter. Nowadays, there are similar figures such as Tommy Nichols, known as Darwin’s veteran eight-fingered croc catcher, or Graham Webb, a founder of the local croc-farming industry, as well as Mick Pitman, a former outlaw croc poacher. The aforementioned individuals proudly assume the collective title of being Irwin’s replacement, but there is a sharp distinction between these individuals and the legendary Irwin. The former are in it for the kill, not just for thrills.\n\n(14). Mick Pitman is often hired by cattle stations to deal with “problem crocs.” According to his line of logic, he does not see any harm in charging tourists large sums of money to kill the crocs he was going to kill in any case. This behaviour is something Irwin would have vehemently opposed, as evidenced by his family’s opposition to the practice.\n\n(15). Approximately four decades after it was almost declared extinct, the croc is an accepted icon, a symbol of the “territory lifestyle.” Although there is much fear and reverence for this gatekeeper of the wilderness, there is also a lot of commercialization and exploitation of its parts."

      "text": "(1). Crocodilians are ambush hunters . Ferocious reptiles, these animals wait half-submerged for land-bound prey to disturb the water surface. Additionally, they appear to have specialized sensory organs on their faces, which can detect silent ripples on the surface of the surrounding water, even in complete darkness. These specialized organs were previously known as “ integumentary sense organs” and were used to distinguish between the alligatorid and the crocodilian families. However, their function, innervation, and phylogenetic history remained unknown. A functionally descriptive name for these organs, as suggested by Soares, is now “dome pressure receptors'' or “ DPRs .”\n\n(2). DPRs , as the name suggests, are round, dome-like structures that lack the presence of pores or protruding hairs. The epidermis located immediately above them is 40% thinner, while the keratin layer is 60% thinner and is considered to be more compact. The faces of alligators are covered with these small, pigmented dome-shaped spots, which are typically 0.5 mm in diameter; it is estimated that thousands of such sensory organs stud the face of an alligator. The distribution of these domes on the alligator’s exterior resembles that of a beard; however, it is also important to note that they are present on the inside of the mouth as well. DPRs are additionally found in fossils dating from the Jurassic Period, suggesting that, alongside possessing an armoured exterior, these semi-aquatic predators had developed distinct tactile sensitivity many millions of years ago.\n\n(3). In behavioral trials, half-submerged alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) have been observed orienting themselves to single water droplets in total darkness and without the use of audition. This orienting behavior demonstrated by crocodiles has been deemed robust in literature. The behavioral response was either head-turning or a full-body lunge in the direction of the source. Notably, this occurred only when the alligators’ faces were positioned on the air-water interface, but such a response was absent in cases where their faces were completely submerged or, conversely, were entirely out of the water.\n\n(4). The highly branched nerve bundle driving the croc’s tactile sensitivity is located a dermal fold below each organ; known as the trigeminal nerve, it is the largest of the twelve cranial nerves in the alligator and is commonly abbreviated as “ CN V .” As it can transmit both sensory and motor information, it is referred to as a mixed cranial nerve . It is divided into three main branches: the ophthalmic, the maxillary, and the mandibular , and each division serves a distinct role. While the ophthalmic and the maxillary only transmit sensory information from the upper face, the mandibular division provides motor innervation to the jaw muscles and also transmits sensation from the mandible and the tongue. Several vertebrates evolved trigeminal nerve-based specialized sensory systems, such as electroreceptors in the platypus as well as infrared receptors in certain snake species.\n\n(5). In crocodilians, CN V roots arise from the brain at the lateral corner of the medulla oblongata, and exit the endocranial cavity via the trigeminal foramen , which is a short passageway or opening. From here, they enter a depression known as the “trigeminal fossa” also referred to as the “ Meckel’s cave, ” which is formed by the lateralsphenoid rostrally and the prootic caudally. This is the location where the trigeminal ganglion is located with the lateralsphenoid and prootic medially and the quadrate and pterygoid bones laterally. The ophthalmic branch exits rostrally from the trigeminal ganglion through its own trough in the laterospheoid; however, the maxillary and the mandibular branches arise from the lateral part of the ganglion, exiting the trigeminal fossa through the maxillomandibular foramen . Although the specific pathway of the mandibular nerve is understood and described in literature, it is nonetheless complex. It is of great significance to note that, after the mandibular nerve continues through the mandible, it emits several variable sized axons that penetrate the lateral surface of the dentary, which is the anterior surface of the teeth-bearing lower jaw. From there, the axons terminate in the integument as nerve endings as well as DPRs.\n\n(6). As described by Daphne Soares in Nature’s article, “An ancient sensory organ in crocodilians”, published in 2002, recordings from the trigeminal ganglion revealed that DPRs appear to be sensitive to surface waves that were created with a piezoelectric “poker”, a type of surface-wave generator. The aforementioned generator was composed of a sinusoidal-wave generator attached to a rod, which was in turn connected to a speaker. Surface waves induced a single spike phase locked to the stimulus, and an increase in the wave amplitude resulted in an increased probability of spike firing. In order to stimulate individual receptors along with the skin that lies between them, Soares opted for a blunt, closed capillary tube attached to a piezoelectric wafer, which served as the secondary stimulus. Soares’ observation was that, while under continuous pressure, the DPR responses adapted quickly. In particular, no response was observed when the skin between the DPRs was exposed to the same pressure that had evoked a response in the DPRs. This finding was consistent with the understanding that DPRs are responsible for detecting pressure waves linked to disruptions to the air-water interface. As a result, Soares suggests that DPRs are perhaps sensitive to pressure differences but not to particle motion.\n\n(7). According to behavioural, paleontological, anatomical, and physiological evidence, crocodilians-an ancient monophyletic group in existence since before even the time of dinosaurs -have evolved a remarkable sensory organ to mediate their orientation towards disruption of the water surface. Through experimentation, Soares has demonstrated that DPRs on croc skin are stimulated by surface waves, which, when covered, remove the animal’s orienting behavior. Additionally, osteological markings of DPRs in the form of foramina have been found on the aforementioned fossil materials, suggesting that these receptors are a unique and conserved feature of semi-aquatic crocodilians.\n\n(8).

It is also important to watch out for option choices containing statements that are true, but don’t answer the question posed in the stem. If we note that only the second option describes the act of ambushing as it applies to crocodiles, we can conclude that it must be true. The first paragraph of the text describes the act of ambushing on the part of crocodiles. Paragraph 1 states: “Crocodilians are ambush hunters. Ferocious reptiles, these animals wait half–submerged for land–bound prey to disturb the water surface.” This tells us that crocodiles are referred to as ambush hunters because they lie in wait before stealthily trapping their prey. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",

      "text": "(1). Crocodilians are ambush hunters . Ferocious reptiles, these animals wait half-submerged for land-bound prey to disturb the water surface. Additionally, they appear to have specialized sensory organs on their faces, which can detect silent ripples on the surface of the surrounding water, even in complete darkness. These specialized organs were previously known as “ integumentary sense organs” and were used to distinguish between the alligatorid and the crocodilian families. However, their function, innervation, and phylogenetic history remained unknown. A functionally descriptive name for these organs, as suggested by Soares, is now “dome pressure receptors'' or “ DPRs .”\n\n(2). DPRs , as the name suggests, are round, dome-like structures that lack the presence of pores or protruding hairs. The epidermis located immediately above them is 40% thinner, while the keratin layer is 60% thinner and is considered to be more compact. The faces of alligators are covered with these small, pigmented dome-shaped spots, which are typically 0.5 mm in diameter; it is estimated that thousands of such sensory organs stud the face of an alligator. The distribution of these domes on the alligator’s exterior resembles that of a beard; however, it is also important to note that they are present on the inside of the mouth as well. DPRs are additionally found in fossils dating from the Jurassic Period, suggesting that, alongside possessing an armoured exterior, these semi-aquatic predators had developed distinct tactile sensitivity many millions of years ago.\n\n(3). In behavioral trials, half-submerged alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) have been observed orienting themselves to single water droplets in total darkness and without the use of audition. This orienting behavior demonstrated by crocodiles has been deemed robust in literature. The behavioral response was either head-turning or a full-body lunge in the direction of the source. Notably, this occurred only when the alligators’ faces were positioned on the air-water interface, but such a response was absent in cases where their faces were completely submerged or, conversely, were entirely out of the water.\n\n(4). The highly branched nerve bundle driving the croc’s tactile sensitivity is located a dermal fold below each organ; known as the trigeminal nerve, it is the largest of the twelve cranial nerves in the alligator and is commonly abbreviated as “ CN V .” As it can transmit both sensory and motor information, it is referred to as a mixed cranial nerve . It is divided into three main branches: the ophthalmic, the maxillary, and the mandibular , and each division serves a distinct role. While the ophthalmic and the maxillary only transmit sensory information from the upper face, the mandibular division provides motor innervation to the jaw muscles and also transmits sensation from the mandible and the tongue. Several vertebrates evolved trigeminal nerve-based specialized sensory systems, such as electroreceptors in the platypus as well as infrared receptors in certain snake species.\n\n(5). In crocodilians, CN V roots arise from the brain at the lateral corner of the medulla oblongata, and exit the endocranial cavity via the trigeminal foramen , which is a short passageway or opening. From here, they enter a depression known as the “trigeminal fossa” also referred to as the “ Meckel’s cave, ” which is formed by the lateralsphenoid rostrally and the prootic caudally. This is the location where the trigeminal ganglion is located with the lateralsphenoid and prootic medially and the quadrate and pterygoid bones laterally. The ophthalmic branch exits rostrally from the trigeminal ganglion through its own trough in the laterospheoid; however, the maxillary and the mandibular branches arise from the lateral part of the ganglion, exiting the trigeminal fossa through the maxillomandibular foramen . Although the specific pathway of the mandibular nerve is understood and described in literature, it is nonetheless complex. It is of great significance to note that, after the mandibular nerve continues through the mandible, it emits several variable sized axons that penetrate the lateral surface of the dentary, which is the anterior surface of the teeth-bearing lower jaw. From there, the axons terminate in the integument as nerve endings as well as DPRs.\n\n(6). As described by Daphne Soares in Nature’s article, “An ancient sensory organ in crocodilians”, published in 2002, recordings from the trigeminal ganglion revealed that DPRs appear to be sensitive to surface waves that were created with a piezoelectric “poker”, a type of surface-wave generator. The aforementioned generator was composed of a sinusoidal-wave generator attached to a rod, which was in turn connected to a speaker. Surface waves induced a single spike phase locked to the stimulus, and an increase in the wave amplitude resulted in an increased probability of spike firing. In order to stimulate individual receptors along with the skin that lies between them, Soares opted for a blunt, closed capillary tube attached to a piezoelectric wafer, which served as the secondary stimulus. Soares’ observation was that, while under continuous pressure, the DPR responses adapted quickly. In particular, no response was observed when the skin between the DPRs was exposed to the same pressure that had evoked a response in the DPRs. This finding was consistent with the understanding that DPRs are responsible for detecting pressure waves linked to disruptions to the air-water interface. As a result, Soares suggests that DPRs are perhaps sensitive to pressure differences but not to particle motion.\n\n(7). According to behavioural, paleontological, anatomical, and physiological evidence, crocodilians-an ancient monophyletic group in existence since before even the time of dinosaurs -have evolved a remarkable sensory organ to mediate their orientation towards disruption of the water surface. Through experimentation, Soares has demonstrated that DPRs on croc skin are stimulated by surface waves, which, when covered, remove the animal’s orienting behavior. Additionally, osteological markings of DPRs in the form of foramina have been found on the aforementioned fossil materials, suggesting that these receptors are a unique and conserved feature of semi-aquatic crocodilians.\n\n(8). Semi-aquatic crocodilians are fascinating in terms of their behavioral, physiological, and structural adaptations; however, they are also aggressive beasts capable of evoking terror in unsuspecting creatures. Humans are not necessarily targeted by crocodiles, but owing to the fact that crocodiles are opportunistic predators, any moving creature is fair game. One such example occurred around 7 a.m. on July 22, 2016, when a 59-year-old man named Jon Becker finished surfing off of Tamarindo’s Playa Grande, located on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Becker placed his foot in the Playa Grande Estuary, but before he could hop on to his surfboard to paddle across, his leg was clamped down upon by a crocodile. Fortunately for Becker, a lifeguard and a friend rushed to his aid, helping to free him from the beast and return him to the shore. The doctors at the Enrique Baltodano Hospital in Liberia tried their best to save Becker’s life  and did so successfully, though at the cost of the man’s right leg, which had to be amputated below his knee. Becker’s crocodile encounter was the third of its kind in the Playa Grande Estuary since 2013, and reportedly the seventh attack in Costa Rica in the year 2016. Additionally, Costa Rica and Brazil tied for the most reported crocodile attacks in the Americas in 2016, according to a worldwide crocodilian attack database known as “ CrocBITE .”\n\n(9). Unfortunately, Costa Rica and Brazil are not the only places that have borne witness to crocodile attacks ; following a fatal crocodile attack in Queensland, Australia, local MP Bob Katter called for a crocodile hunt in early 2016. The request for the hunt was owing to the “unprecedented” numbers of crocs present in Queensland, and its purpose was to attain a balance back in nature. It should be noted that approximately fifteen people have been killed by crocs in Northern Australia in the last 10 years. In 2014 in particular, there was a record number of fatal croc attacks in NT. Consequently, the Federal Government has been pushing to “develop the north” and increase its human population. However, with increasing numbers of Australians living in crocodile territory, more attacks seem inevitable.\n\n(10). Crocodiles in Northern Australia are already unofficially being culled . The animals are trapped around Darwin, Katherine, and parts of Arnhem Land before being taken to a local croc farm for one of two purposes: breeding or butchering.\n\n(11). Every year, Hermès , a French manufacturer of high-fashion luxury goods, sells millions of dollars’ worth of croc handbags. In fact, some of the skin that is displayed on the catwalk can be traced back to the animals harvested from the Northern Territory (NT) wilderness of the Land Down Under before being matured on a Hermès-owned farm near the city of Darwin.\n\n(12). The most staunch and aggressive defenders of the wild crocs may be those who have a stake in their commercial exploitation, given that the growing leather industry depends on croc eggs harvested from the wild. In 2016, the NT Government announced a plan that would increase the annual quota of wild-harvested crocodile eggs to 90,000, thus effectively industrializing remote parts of NT and transforming them into breeding grounds for use in the fashion industry–supplying material to design everything from handbags to watch bands.\n\n(13). It has been more than ten years since the death of Steve Irwin, the gregarious Queenslander and popular TV crocodile hunter. Nowadays, there are similar figures such as Tommy Nichols, known as Darwin’s veteran eight-fingered croc catcher, or Graham Webb, a founder of the local croc-farming industry, as well as Mick Pitman, a former outlaw croc poacher. The aforementioned individuals proudly assume the collective title of being Irwin’s replacement, but there is a sharp distinction between these individuals and the legendary Irwin. The former are in it for the kill, not just for thrills.\n\n(14). Mick Pitman is often hired by cattle stations to deal with “problem crocs.” According to his line of logic, he does not see any harm in charging tourists large sums of money to kill the crocs he was going to kill in any case. This behaviour is something Irwin would have vehemently opposed, as evidenced by his family’s opposition to the practice.\n\n(15). Approximately four decades after it was almost declared extinct, the croc is an accepted icon, a symbol of the “territory lifestyle.” Although there is much fear and reverence for this gatekeeper of the wilderness, there is also a lot of commercialization and exploitation of its parts."

      "text": "(1). On April 26 th , 1986, at 1:23:40 A.M., Ukraine became the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in human history. Ironically, the events of the Chernobyl disaster unfolded because of a safety test that went wrong. The actions of its test supervisor and the inherent design flaws of Chernobyl’s core reactor are largely responsible for the cataclysmic aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. The incident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is ranked in the highest class of a nuclear disaster, only matched by the nuclear disaster at Fukushima . The total estimate of the deaths due to the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl ranges from 4,000 to as high as 93,000 . The disaster became a pivotal moment in the dissolution of the USSR regime, and it gained global attention for its revolutionary impact on nuclear management.\n\n(2). The safety test at Chernobyl was designed to improve emergency response in a power outage situation; the purpose was to check if backup generators could replace the steam turbine generators in time. The electrically derived energy would have to be enough to pump water into the fuel channels for about 45 seconds, to avoid a core meltdown in the meantime.\n\n(3). In a nuclear reaction, heat is generated through fission , essentially the splitting of uranium atoms. A steam turbine then converts the energy into electricity capable of powering large cities like Kyiv , the capital of Ukraine. Uranium is stored in metal tubes called fuel rods , in a fuel assembly consisting of more than 200 tubes and the power output of the reactor determines how many assemblies are put inside the core. Inside the reactor vessel, the fuel rods are immersed in water, which acts as a coolant and moderator. Control rods are installed to provide further regulation of the reaction rate. Under normal circumstances, inserting the control rods lowers reaction rate, and removing them speeds up the reaction.\n\n(4). The preparation for the safety test at Chernobyl was questionable from the very start. It was approved by the director of the plant, but his approval did not correspond with established procedures . Furthermore, the day shift was supposed to begin the experiment the previous day, while the night shift would maintain cooling systems. However, the unexpected shutoff of a regional power plant catapulted Chernobyl into producing power to satisfy the needs of Kyiv. Anatoly Dyatlov , the deputy chief engineer of the Chernobyl Power Plant, was supervising the experiment, his rank giving him superiority over all other personnel. Dyatlov was the incompetent executive that propagated a series of catastrophic decisions at Chernobyl, one after the other.\n\n(5). The test procedure in question called for half of the normal power output, which accumulated xenon-135. Xenon-135 is a by-product of fission, and it decays into a less stable isotope under a steady state. It also inhibits the reaction rate in a process known as “reactor poisoning by absorbing neutrons.” The power output was lowered further to 500 MW before suddenly plummeting to 5% of the procedural value. The mystery behind the unexpected power drop remains unsolved, partly because the two engineers who operated the controls died of acute radiation syndrome within two weeks of the incident. To counter the rapid decline in power output, the control-room personnel removed most of the control rods from the core to get the power back up. The power output began to rise after a couple of minutes, but excessive xenon-135 build-up hampered a quick recovery, so further control rods were removed. Alarms began to sound due to low power level, core poisoning, and lack of coolant flow but were ignored to preserve the reactor level.\n\n(6). Dyatlov elected to proceed with the test when a power of 200 MW was attained, despite all the disturbing signals . Water flow into the reactor decreased because of the gradual transition from the steam turbines to the backup generators. An RMBK reactor like the one in Chernobyl has a positive void coefficient , meaning that the nuclear chain reaction entered a positive feedback loop when the water boiled into steam. As the power continued to increase, water continually flashed into steam. The emergency button pressed to insert all the control rods was the nail in the coffin; the tips of the rods were covered in graphite, which displaced water in a complex neutron interaction and increased power further. The defect in the RBMK design made it very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing power to a dangerous level. The power output spiked astronomically, and the last reading of the meter indicated a 10-fold increase over the normal levels.\n\n(7). The first explosion that occurred is believed to have been a steam explosion caused by vapor buildup. A second explosion followed shortly after, sending pieces of radioactive graphite through the roof of the building of reactor-4. The most immediate concern was to extinguish the fire on the roof of reactor-4 before it spread to reactor-3. The fire within the reactor core had to be contained with clay, sand, and lead.\n\n(8). The nex t stage of damage control was to drain the water tanks below the reactor to prevent another steam explosion. After the tank valves were opened, miners were called to dig tunnels below the reactor and fill it with concrete to support the reactor’s core foundation. The last step was the removal of radioactive debris from the rooftop of reactor- 4, so that safe confinement could be built around the reactor. When robotic trials proved unsuccessful due to immense radiation, thousands of workers collaborated in 45-90 second trips to complete the task.\n\n(9). Reactor employees were exposed to lethal levels of radiation in minutes, while hundreds of firefighters and pilots risked their lives to contain the fires. In its initial stages, acute radiation syndrome is characterized by tasting metal or feeling pins and needles on the face, symptoms that most firefighters reported experiencing on site. The initial stage of acute radiation syndrome is followed by a latent period. During this stage, symptoms are barely noticeable for a few hours or weeks. Then, the body begins to break down through infections, bleeding, confusion, and dehydration. Recovery is possible, although an overwhelming majority of Chernobyl workers passed due to severe exposure to radiation.\n\n(10). The evacuation of Pripyat , the city closest to Chernobyl, was not initiated until 36 hours after the first blast. Although the residents were told that the evacuation would be temporary and to only carry the most important belongings with themselves, within a week, the exclusion zone was extended to 30 kilometres and 350,000 people were permanently displaced.\n\n(11). The Soviet Union intended to keep the disaster at Chernobyl a secret for as long as possible. As a result, many of the facts of the situation remain uncertain and exact numbers are still a subject of controversy. The Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, a nuclear plant in Sweden that detected radiation levels from over 1,000 miles away, unmasked the Soviet’s sinister plan. They noticed radioactive particles on their suits and contacted the Soviet Union for clarity, but it was not until they were threatened to be reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency that the USSR fessed up to the incident; even then, however, they portrayed the disaster to be much less concerning than it was.\n\n(12). Contrary to the exact death tolls, the environmental damage from the radioactive fallout of Chernobyl is well-documented. The most known example is The Red Forest , a four-square kilometre patch of pine trees that turned brown-red and died. Traces of radioactive damage have led to gross deformities in farm animals, with nearly 350 animals being born with various deformities. This is in stark contrast to the three abnormal births that had been registered in the five years before the 4-year sample. Sheep movement in all areas of the UK was also prohibited to avoid contamination of other parts of the human food chain by radiation. It was not until 26 years later, in 2012, that all restrictions were lifted. The amount of radioactive material released by the Chernobyl incident was four hundred-fold more than the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n(13). Ultimately, the disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant had a major impact on the nuclear debate and the USSR. The completion of reactors 5 and 6 at Chernobyl was abandoned very quickly, as these shared the design flaws of reactor 4. Moreover, the need for better safety standards meant that nuclear reactors cost more to build , discouraging many investors from taking on the challenge. There was a noticeable drop in new nuclear start-ups after 1986 . Additionally, the secrecy behind the Chernobyl accident raised concerns about the safety standards within all other nuclear reactors in the Soviet Union. This led to a level of transparency that the Union did not like, ultimately making way for the collapse of the regime.\n\n(14). The historical maximum number of nuclear reactors was established in 2017 with 448. Nuclear energy is often criticized due to safety concerns and operation costs , but supporters argue for its cleanliness and sustainability. The debate on nuclear energy will likely continue for several years, though it is encouraging to observe a trend of using renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels."

To counter the rapid decline in power output, the control-room personnel removed most of the control rods from the core to get the power back up. The power output began to rise after a couple of minutes, but excessive xenon-135 build-up hampered a quick recovery, so further control rods were removed. Alarms began to sound due to low power level, core poisoning, and lack of coolant flow but were ignored to preserve the reactor level.\n\n(6). Dyatlov elected to proceed with the test when a power of 200 MW was attained, despite all the disturbing signals . Water flow into the reactor decreased because of the gradual transition from the steam turbines to the backup generators. An RMBK reactor like the one in Chernobyl has a positive void coefficient , meaning that the nuclear chain reaction entered a positive feedback loop when the water boiled into steam. As the power continued to increase, water continually flashed into steam. The emergency button pressed to insert all the control rods was the nail in the coffin; the tips of the rods were covered in graphite, which displaced water in a complex neutron interaction and increased power further. The defect in the RBMK design made it very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing power to a dangerous level. The power output spiked astronomically, and the last reading of the meter indicated a 10-fold increase over the normal levels.\n\n(7). The first explosion that occurred is believed to have been a steam explosion caused by vapor buildup. A second explosion followed shortly after, sending pieces of radioactive graphite through the roof of the building of reactor-4. The most immediate concern was to extinguish the fire on the roof of reactor-4 before it spread to reactor-3. The fire within the reactor core had to be contained with clay, sand, and lead.\n\n(8). The nex t stage of damage control was to drain the water tanks below the reactor to prevent another steam explosion. After the tank valves were opened, miners were called to dig tunnels below the reactor and fill it with concrete to support the reactor’s core foundation. The last step was the removal of radioactive debris from the rooftop of reactor- 4, so that safe confinement could be built around the reactor. When robotic trials proved unsuccessful due to immense radiation, thousands of workers collaborated in 45-90 second trips to complete the task.\n\n(9). Reactor employees were exposed to lethal levels of radiation in minutes, while hundreds of firefighters and pilots risked their lives to contain the fires. In its initial stages, acute radiation syndrome is characterized by tasting metal or feeling pins and needles on the face, symptoms that most firefighters reported experiencing on site. The initial stage of acute radiation syndrome is followed by a latent period. During this stage, symptoms are barely noticeable for a few hours or weeks. Then, the body begins to break down through infections, bleeding, confusion, and dehydration. Recovery is possible, although an overwhelming majority of Chernobyl workers passed due to severe exposure to radiation.\n\n(10). The evacuation of Pripyat , the city closest to Chernobyl, was not initiated until 36 hours after the first blast. Although the residents were told that the evacuation would be temporary and to only carry the most important belongings with themselves, within a week, the exclusion zone was extended to 30 kilometres and 350,000 people were permanently displaced.\n\n(11). The Soviet Union intended to keep the disaster at Chernobyl a secret for as long as possible. As a result, many of the facts of the situation remain uncertain and exact numbers are still a subject of controversy. The Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, a nuclear plant in Sweden that detected radiation levels from over 1,000 miles away, unmasked the Soviet’s sinister plan. They noticed radioactive particles on their suits and contacted the Soviet Union for clarity, but it was not until they were threatened to be reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency that the USSR fessed up to the incident; even then, however, they portrayed the disaster to be much less concerning than it was.\n\n(12). Contrary to the exact death tolls, the environmental damage from the radioactive fallout of Chernobyl is well-documented. The most known example is The Red Forest , a four-square kilometre patch of pine trees that turned brown-red and died. Traces of radioactive damage have led to gross deformities in farm animals, with nearly 350 animals being born with various deformities. This is in stark contrast to the three abnormal births that had been registered in the five years before the 4-year sample. Sheep movement in all areas of the UK was also prohibited to avoid contamination of other parts of the human food chain by radiation. It was not until 26 years later, in 2012, that all restrictions were lifted. The amount of radioactive material released by the Chernobyl incident was four hundred-fold more than the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n(13). Ultimately, the disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant had a major impact on the nuclear debate and the USSR. The completion of reactors 5 and 6 at Chernobyl was abandoned very quickly, as these shared the design flaws of reactor 4. Moreover, the need for better safety standards meant that nuclear reactors cost more to build , discouraging many investors from taking on the challenge. There was a noticeable drop in new nuclear start-ups after 1986 . Additionally, the secrecy behind the Chernobyl accident raised concerns about the safety standards within all other nuclear reactors in the Soviet Union. This led to a level of transparency that the Union did not like, ultimately making way for the collapse of the regime.\n\n(14). The historical maximum number of nuclear reactors was established in 2017 with 448. Nuclear energy is often criticized due to safety concerns and operation costs , but supporters argue for its cleanliness and sustainability. The debate on nuclear energy will likely continue for several years, though it is encouraging to observe a trend of using renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should first search the passage for the paragraph or paragraph discussing the evacuation efforts following the Chernobyl disaster. These are discussed in paragraph 10: “The evacuation of Pripyat, the city closest to Chernobyl, was not initiated until 36 hours after the first blast. Although the residents were told that the evacuation would be temporary and to only carry the most important belongings with themselves, within a week, the exclusion zone was extended to 30 kilometres and 350,000 people were permanently displaced.” If we note that Pripyat was not evacuated until 36 hours AFTER the blast occurred at Chernobyl, we should search the paragraph for mention of when the actual blast occurred at the power plant. This can be found in paragraph 1: “On April 26 th , 1986, at 1:23:40 A.M., Ukraine became the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in human history.” By combining the information gathered from paragraphs 1 and 10, we can see that the Chernobyl disaster happened on April 26 th , 1986, at 1:23:40 A.M., but Pripyat wasn’t evacuated until 36 hours later; thus, evacuation orders were issued at 1:23 P.M., April 27 th , 1986 .

      "text": "(1). On April 26 th , 1986, at 1:23:40 A.M., Ukraine became the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in human history. Ironically, the events of the Chernobyl disaster unfolded because of a safety test that went wrong. The actions of its test supervisor and the inherent design flaws of Chernobyl’s core reactor are largely responsible for the cataclysmic aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. The incident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is ranked in the highest class of a nuclear disaster, only matched by the nuclear disaster at Fukushima . The total estimate of the deaths due to the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl ranges from 4,000 to as high as 93,000 . The disaster became a pivotal moment in the dissolution of the USSR regime, and it gained global attention for its revolutionary impact on nuclear management.\n\n(2). The safety test at Chernobyl was designed to improve emergency response in a power outage situation; the purpose was to check if backup generators could replace the steam turbine generators in time. The electrically derived energy would have to be enough to pump water into the fuel channels for about 45 seconds, to avoid a core meltdown in the meantime.\n\n(3). In a nuclear reaction, heat is generated through fission , essentially the splitting of uranium atoms. A steam turbine then converts the energy into electricity capable of powering large cities like Kyiv , the capital of Ukraine. Uranium is stored in metal tubes called fuel rods , in a fuel assembly consisting of more than 200 tubes and the power output of the reactor determines how many assemblies are put inside the core. Inside the reactor vessel, the fuel rods are immersed in water, which acts as a coolant and moderator. Control rods are installed to provide further regulation of the reaction rate. Under normal circumstances, inserting the control rods lowers reaction rate, and removing them speeds up the reaction.\n\n(4). The preparation for the safety test at Chernobyl was questionable from the very start. It was approved by the director of the plant, but his approval did not correspond with established procedures . Furthermore, the day shift was supposed to begin the experiment the previous day, while the night shift would maintain cooling systems. However, the unexpected shutoff of a regional power plant catapulted Chernobyl into producing power to satisfy the needs of Kyiv. Anatoly Dyatlov , the deputy chief engineer of the Chernobyl Power Plant, was supervising the experiment, his rank giving him superiority over all other personnel. Dyatlov was the incompetent executive that propagated a series of catastrophic decisions at Chernobyl, one after the other.\n\n(5). The test procedure in question called for half of the normal power output, which accumulated xenon-135. Xenon-135 is a by-product of fission, and it decays into a less stable isotope under a steady state. It also inhibits the reaction rate in a process known as “reactor poisoning by absorbing neutrons.” The power output was lowered further to 500 MW before suddenly plummeting to 5% of the procedural value. The mystery behind the unexpected power drop remains unsolved, partly because the two engineers who operated the controls died of acute radiation syndrome within two weeks of the incident. To counter the rapid decline in power output, the control-room personnel removed most of the control rods from the core to get the power back up. The power output began to rise after a couple of minutes, but excessive xenon-135 build-up hampered a quick recovery, so further control rods were removed. Alarms began to sound due to low power level, core poisoning, and lack of coolant flow but were ignored to preserve the reactor level.\n\n(6). Dyatlov elected to proceed with the test when a power of 200 MW was attained, despite all the disturbing signals . Water flow into the reactor decreased because of the gradual transition from the steam turbines to the backup generators. An RMBK reactor like the one in Chernobyl has a positive void coefficient , meaning that the nuclear chain reaction entered a positive feedback loop when the water boiled into steam. As the power continued to increase, water continually flashed into steam. The emergency button pressed to insert all the control rods was the nail in the coffin; the tips of the rods were covered in graphite, which displaced water in a complex neutron interaction and increased power further. The defect in the RBMK design made it very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing power to a dangerous level. The power output spiked astronomically, and the last reading of the meter indicated a 10-fold increase over the normal levels.\n\n(7). The first explosion that occurred is believed to have been a steam explosion caused by vapor buildup. A second explosion followed shortly after, sending pieces of radioactive graphite through the roof of the building of reactor-4. The most immediate concern was to extinguish the fire on the roof of reactor-4 before it spread to reactor-3. The fire within the reactor core had to be contained with clay, sand, and lead.\n\n(8). The nex t stage of damage control was to drain the water tanks below the reactor to prevent another steam explosion. After the tank valves were opened, miners were called to dig tunnels below the reactor and fill it with concrete to support the reactor’s core foundation. The last step was the removal of radioactive debris from the rooftop of reactor- 4, so that safe confinement could be built around the reactor. When robotic trials proved unsuccessful due to immense radiation, thousands of workers collaborated in 45-90 second trips to complete the task.\n\n(9). Reactor employees were exposed to lethal levels of radiation in minutes, while hundreds of firefighters and pilots risked their lives to contain the fires. In its initial stages, acute radiation syndrome is characterized by tasting metal or feeling pins and needles on the face, symptoms that most firefighters reported experiencing on site. The initial stage of acute radiation syndrome is followed by a latent period. During this stage, symptoms are barely noticeable for a few hours or weeks. Then, the body begins to break down through infections, bleeding, confusion, and dehydration. Recovery is possible, although an overwhelming majority of Chernobyl workers passed due to severe exposure to radiation.\n\n(10).

      "text": "(1). On April 26 th , 1986, at 1:23:40 A.M., Ukraine became the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in human history. Ironically, the events of the Chernobyl disaster unfolded because of a safety test that went wrong. The actions of its test supervisor and the inherent design flaws of Chernobyl’s core reactor are largely responsible for the cataclysmic aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. The incident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is ranked in the highest class of a nuclear disaster, only matched by the nuclear disaster at Fukushima . The total estimate of the deaths due to the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl ranges from 4,000 to as high as 93,000 . The disaster became a pivotal moment in the dissolution of the USSR regime, and it gained global attention for its revolutionary impact on nuclear management.\n\n(2). The safety test at Chernobyl was designed to improve emergency response in a power outage situation; the purpose was to check if backup generators could replace the steam turbine generators in time. The electrically derived energy would have to be enough to pump water into the fuel channels for about 45 seconds, to avoid a core meltdown in the meantime.\n\n(3). In a nuclear reaction, heat is generated through fission , essentially the splitting of uranium atoms. A steam turbine then converts the energy into electricity capable of powering large cities like Kyiv , the capital of Ukraine. Uranium is stored in metal tubes called fuel rods , in a fuel assembly consisting of more than 200 tubes and the power output of the reactor determines how many assemblies are put inside the core. Inside the reactor vessel, the fuel rods are immersed in water, which acts as a coolant and moderator. Control rods are installed to provide further regulation of the reaction rate. Under normal circumstances, inserting the control rods lowers reaction rate, and removing them speeds up the reaction.\n\n(4). The preparation for the safety test at Chernobyl was questionable from the very start. It was approved by the director of the plant, but his approval did not correspond with established procedures . Furthermore, the day shift was supposed to begin the experiment the previous day, while the night shift would maintain cooling systems. However, the unexpected shutoff of a regional power plant catapulted Chernobyl into producing power to satisfy the needs of Kyiv. Anatoly Dyatlov , the deputy chief engineer of the Chernobyl Power Plant, was supervising the experiment, his rank giving him superiority over all other personnel. Dyatlov was the incompetent executive that propagated a series of catastrophic decisions at Chernobyl, one after the other.\n\n(5). The test procedure in question called for half of the normal power output, which accumulated xenon-135. Xenon-135 is a by-product of fission, and it decays into a less stable isotope under a steady state. It also inhibits the reaction rate in a process known as “reactor poisoning by absorbing neutrons.” The power output was lowered further to 500 MW before suddenly plummeting to 5% of the procedural value. The mystery behind the unexpected power drop remains unsolved, partly because the two engineers who operated the controls died of acute radiation syndrome within two weeks of the incident. To counter the rapid decline in power output, the control-room personnel removed most of the control rods from the core to get the power back up. The power output began to rise after a couple of minutes, but excessive xenon-135 build-up hampered a quick recovery, so further control rods were removed. Alarms began to sound due to low power level, core poisoning, and lack of coolant flow but were ignored to preserve the reactor level.\n\n(6). Dyatlov elected to proceed with the test when a power of 200 MW was attained, despite all the disturbing signals . Water flow into the reactor decreased because of the gradual transition from the steam turbines to the backup generators. An RMBK reactor like the one in Chernobyl has a positive void coefficient , meaning that the nuclear chain reaction entered a positive feedback loop when the water boiled into steam. As the power continued to increase, water continually flashed into steam. The emergency button pressed to insert all the control rods was the nail in the coffin; the tips of the rods were covered in graphite, which displaced water in a complex neutron interaction and increased power further. The defect in the RBMK design made it very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing power to a dangerous level. The power output spiked astronomically, and the last reading of the meter indicated a 10-fold increase over the normal levels.\n\n(7). The first explosion that occurred is believed to have been a steam explosion caused by vapor buildup. A second explosion followed shortly after, sending pieces of radioactive graphite through the roof of the building of reactor-4. The most immediate concern was to extinguish the fire on the roof of reactor-4 before it spread to reactor-3. The fire within the reactor core had to be contained with clay, sand, and lead.\n\n(8). The nex t stage of damage control was to drain the water tanks below the reactor to prevent another steam explosion. After the tank valves were opened, miners were called to dig tunnels below the reactor and fill it with concrete to support the reactor’s core foundation. The last step was the removal of radioactive debris from the rooftop of reactor- 4, so that safe confinement could be built around the reactor. When robotic trials proved unsuccessful due to immense radiation, thousands of workers collaborated in 45-90 second trips to complete the task.\n\n(9). Reactor employees were exposed to lethal levels of radiation in minutes, while hundreds of firefighters and pilots risked their lives to contain the fires. In its initial stages, acute radiation syndrome is characterized by tasting metal or feeling pins and needles on the face, symptoms that most firefighters reported experiencing on site. The initial stage of acute radiation syndrome is followed by a latent period. During this stage, symptoms are barely noticeable for a few hours or weeks. Then, the body begins to break down through infections, bleeding, confusion, and dehydration. Recovery is possible, although an overwhelming majority of Chernobyl workers passed due to severe exposure to radiation.\n\n(10). The evacuation of Pripyat , the city closest to Chernobyl, was not initiated until 36 hours after the first blast. Although the residents were told that the evacuation would be temporary and to only carry the most important belongings with themselves, within a week, the exclusion zone was extended to 30 kilometres and 350,000 people were permanently displaced.\n\n(11). The Soviet Union intended to keep the disaster at Chernobyl a secret for as long as possible. As a result, many of the facts of the situation remain uncertain and exact numbers are still a subject of controversy. The Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, a nuclear plant in Sweden that detected radiation levels from over 1,000 miles away, unmasked the Soviet’s sinister plan. They noticed radioactive particles on their suits and contacted the Soviet Union for clarity, but it was not until they were threatened to be reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency that the USSR fessed up to the incident; even then, however, they portrayed the disaster to be much less concerning than it was.\n\n(12). Contrary to the exact death tolls, the environmental damage from the radioactive fallout of Chernobyl is well-documented. The most known example is The Red Forest , a four-square kilometre patch of pine trees that turned brown-red and died. Traces of radioactive damage have led to gross deformities in farm animals, with nearly 350 animals being born with various deformities. This is in stark contrast to the three abnormal births that had been registered in the five years before the 4-year sample. Sheep movement in all areas of the UK was also prohibited to avoid contamination of other parts of the human food chain by radiation. It was not until 26 years later, in 2012, that all restrictions were lifted. The amount of radioactive material released by the Chernobyl incident was four hundred-fold more than the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n(13). Ultimately, the disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant had a major impact on the nuclear debate and the USSR. The completion of reactors 5 and 6 at Chernobyl was abandoned very quickly, as these shared the design flaws of reactor 4. Moreover, the need for better safety standards meant that nuclear reactors cost more to build , discouraging many investors from taking on the challenge. There was a noticeable drop in new nuclear start-ups after 1986 . Additionally, the secrecy behind the Chernobyl accident raised concerns about the safety standards within all other nuclear reactors in the Soviet Union. This led to a level of transparency that the Union did not like, ultimately making way for the collapse of the regime.\n\n(14). The historical maximum number of nuclear reactors was established in 2017 with 448. Nuclear energy is often criticized due to safety concerns and operation costs , but supporters argue for its cleanliness and sustainability. The debate on nuclear energy will likely continue for several years, though it is encouraging to observe a trend of using renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels."

      "text": "(1). On April 26 th , 1986, at 1:23:40 A.M., Ukraine became the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in human history. Ironically, the events of the Chernobyl disaster unfolded because of a safety test that went wrong. The actions of its test supervisor and the inherent design flaws of Chernobyl’s core reactor are largely responsible for the cataclysmic aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. The incident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is ranked in the highest class of a nuclear disaster, only matched by the nuclear disaster at Fukushima . The total estimate of the deaths due to the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl ranges from 4,000 to as high as 93,000 . The disaster became a pivotal moment in the dissolution of the USSR regime, and it gained global attention for its revolutionary impact on nuclear management.\n\n(2). The safety test at Chernobyl was designed to improve emergency response in a power outage situation; the purpose was to check if backup generators could replace the steam turbine generators in time. The electrically derived energy would have to be enough to pump water into the fuel channels for about 45 seconds, to avoid a core meltdown in the meantime.\n\n(3). In a nuclear reaction, heat is generated through fission , essentially the splitting of uranium atoms. A steam turbine then converts the energy into electricity capable of powering large cities like Kyiv , the capital of Ukraine. Uranium is stored in metal tubes called fuel rods , in a fuel assembly consisting of more than 200 tubes and the power output of the reactor determines how many assemblies are put inside the core. Inside the reactor vessel, the fuel rods are immersed in water, which acts as a coolant and moderator. Control rods are installed to provide further regulation of the reaction rate. Under normal circumstances, inserting the control rods lowers reaction rate, and removing them speeds up the reaction.\n\n(4). The preparation for the safety test at Chernobyl was questionable from the very start. It was approved by the director of the plant, but his approval did not correspond with established procedures . Furthermore, the day shift was supposed to begin the experiment the previous day, while the night shift would maintain cooling systems. However, the unexpected shutoff of a regional power plant catapulted Chernobyl into producing power to satisfy the needs of Kyiv. Anatoly Dyatlov , the deputy chief engineer of the Chernobyl Power Plant, was supervising the experiment, his rank giving him superiority over all other personnel. Dyatlov was the incompetent executive that propagated a series of catastrophic decisions at Chernobyl, one after the other.\n\n(5). The test procedure in question called for half of the normal power output, which accumulated xenon-135. Xenon-135 is a by-product of fission, and it decays into a less stable isotope under a steady state. It also inhibits the reaction rate in a process known as “reactor poisoning by absorbing neutrons.” The power output was lowered further to 500 MW before suddenly plummeting to 5% of the procedural value. The mystery behind the unexpected power drop remains unsolved, partly because the two engineers who operated the controls died of acute radiation syndrome within two weeks of the incident. To counter the rapid decline in power output, the control-room personnel removed most of the control rods from the core to get the power back up. The power output began to rise after a couple of minutes, but excessive xenon-135 build-up hampered a quick recovery, so further control rods were removed. Alarms began to sound due to low power level, core poisoning, and lack of coolant flow but were ignored to preserve the reactor level.\n\n(6). Dyatlov elected to proceed with the test when a power of 200 MW was attained, despite all the disturbing signals . Water flow into the reactor decreased because of the gradual transition from the steam turbines to the backup generators. An RMBK reactor like the one in Chernobyl has a positive void coefficient , meaning that the nuclear chain reaction entered a positive feedback loop when the water boiled into steam. As the power continued to increase, water continually flashed into steam. The emergency button pressed to insert all the control rods was the nail in the coffin; the tips of the rods were covered in graphite, which displaced water in a complex neutron interaction and increased power further. The defect in the RBMK design made it very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing power to a dangerous level. The power output spiked astronomically, and the last reading of the meter indicated a 10-fold increase over the normal levels.\n\n(7). The first explosion that occurred is believed to have been a steam explosion caused by vapor buildup. A second explosion followed shortly after, sending pieces of radioactive graphite through the roof of the building of reactor-4. The most immediate concern was to extinguish the fire on the roof of reactor-4 before it spread to reactor-3. The fire within the reactor core had to be contained with clay, sand, and lead.\n\n(8). The nex t stage of damage control was to drain the water tanks below the reactor to prevent another steam explosion. After the tank valves were opened, miners were called to dig tunnels below the reactor and fill it with concrete to support the reactor’s core foundation. The last step was the removal of radioactive debris from the rooftop of reactor- 4, so that safe confinement could be built around the reactor. When robotic trials proved unsuccessful due to immense radiation, thousands of workers collaborated in 45-90 second trips to complete the task.\n\n(9). Reactor employees were exposed to lethal levels of radiation in minutes, while hundreds of firefighters and pilots risked their lives to contain the fires. In its initial stages, acute radiation syndrome is characterized by tasting metal or feeling pins and needles on the face, symptoms that most firefighters reported experiencing on site. The initial stage of acute radiation syndrome is followed by a latent period. During this stage, symptoms are barely noticeable for a few hours or weeks.

      "text": "(1). On April 26 th , 1986, at 1:23:40 A.M., Ukraine became the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in human history. Ironically, the events of the Chernobyl disaster unfolded because of a safety test that went wrong. The actions of its test supervisor and the inherent design flaws of Chernobyl’s core reactor are largely responsible for the cataclysmic aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. The incident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is ranked in the highest class of a nuclear disaster, only matched by the nuclear disaster at Fukushima . The total estimate of the deaths due to the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl ranges from 4,000 to as high as 93,000 . The disaster became a pivotal moment in the dissolution of the USSR regime, and it gained global attention for its revolutionary impact on nuclear management.\n\n(2). The safety test at Chernobyl was designed to improve emergency response in a power outage situation; the purpose was to check if backup generators could replace the steam turbine generators in time. The electrically derived energy would have to be enough to pump water into the fuel channels for about 45 seconds, to avoid a core meltdown in the meantime.\n\n(3). In a nuclear reaction, heat is generated through fission , essentially the splitting of uranium atoms. A steam turbine then converts the energy into electricity capable of powering large cities like Kyiv , the capital of Ukraine. Uranium is stored in metal tubes called fuel rods , in a fuel assembly consisting of more than 200 tubes and the power output of the reactor determines how many assemblies are put inside the core. Inside the reactor vessel, the fuel rods are immersed in water, which acts as a coolant and moderator. Control rods are installed to provide further regulation of the reaction rate. Under normal circumstances, inserting the control rods lowers reaction rate, and removing them speeds up the reaction.\n\n(4). The preparation for the safety test at Chernobyl was questionable from the very start. It was approved by the director of the plant, but his approval did not correspond with established procedures . Furthermore, the day shift was supposed to begin the experiment the previous day, while the night shift would maintain cooling systems. However, the unexpected shutoff of a regional power plant catapulted Chernobyl into producing power to satisfy the needs of Kyiv. Anatoly Dyatlov , the deputy chief engineer of the Chernobyl Power Plant, was supervising the experiment, his rank giving him superiority over all other personnel. Dyatlov was the incompetent executive that propagated a series of catastrophic decisions at Chernobyl, one after the other.\n\n(5). The test procedure in question called for half of the normal power output, which accumulated xenon-135. Xenon-135 is a by-product of fission, and it decays into a less stable isotope under a steady state. It also inhibits the reaction rate in a process known as “reactor poisoning by absorbing neutrons.” The power output was lowered further to 500 MW before suddenly plummeting to 5% of the procedural value. The mystery behind the unexpected power drop remains unsolved, partly because the two engineers who operated the controls died of acute radiation syndrome within two weeks of the incident. To counter the rapid decline in power output, the control-room personnel removed most of the control rods from the core to get the power back up. The power output began to rise after a couple of minutes, but excessive xenon-135 build-up hampered a quick recovery, so further control rods were removed. Alarms began to sound due to low power level, core poisoning, and lack of coolant flow but were ignored to preserve the reactor level.\n\n(6). Dyatlov elected to proceed with the test when a power of 200 MW was attained, despite all the disturbing signals . Water flow into the reactor decreased because of the gradual transition from the steam turbines to the backup generators. An RMBK reactor like the one in Chernobyl has a positive void coefficient , meaning that the nuclear chain reaction entered a positive feedback loop when the water boiled into steam. As the power continued to increase, water continually flashed into steam. The emergency button pressed to insert all the control rods was the nail in the coffin; the tips of the rods were covered in graphite, which displaced water in a complex neutron interaction and increased power further. The defect in the RBMK design made it very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing power to a dangerous level. The power output spiked astronomically, and the last reading of the meter indicated a 10-fold increase over the normal levels.\n\n(7). The first explosion that occurred is believed to have been a steam explosion caused by vapor buildup. A second explosion followed shortly after, sending pieces of radioactive graphite through the roof of the building of reactor-4. The most immediate concern was to extinguish the fire on the roof of reactor-4 before it spread to reactor-3. The fire within the reactor core had to be contained with clay, sand, and lead.\n\n(8). The nex t stage of damage control was to drain the water tanks below the reactor to prevent another steam explosion. After the tank valves were opened, miners were called to dig tunnels below the reactor and fill it with concrete to support the reactor’s core foundation. The last step was the removal of radioactive debris from the rooftop of reactor- 4, so that safe confinement could be built around the reactor. When robotic trials proved unsuccessful due to immense radiation, thousands of workers collaborated in 45-90 second trips to complete the task.\n\n(9). Reactor employees were exposed to lethal levels of radiation in minutes, while hundreds of firefighters and pilots risked their lives to contain the fires. In its initial stages, acute radiation syndrome is characterized by tasting metal or feeling pins and needles on the face, symptoms that most firefighters reported experiencing on site. The initial stage of acute radiation syndrome is followed by a latent period. During this stage, symptoms are barely noticeable for a few hours or weeks. Then, the body begins to break down through infections, bleeding, confusion, and dehydration. Recovery is possible, although an overwhelming majority of Chernobyl workers passed due to severe exposure to radiation.\n\n(10). The evacuation of Pripyat , the city closest to Chernobyl, was not initiated until 36 hours after the first blast. Although the residents were told that the evacuation would be temporary and to only carry the most important belongings with themselves, within a week, the exclusion zone was extended to 30 kilometres and 350,000 people were permanently displaced.\n\n(11). The Soviet Union intended to keep the disaster at Chernobyl a secret for as long as possible. As a result, many of the facts of the situation remain uncertain and exact numbers are still a subject of controversy. The Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, a nuclear plant in Sweden that detected radiation levels from over 1,000 miles away, unmasked the Soviet’s sinister plan. They noticed radioactive particles on their suits and contacted the Soviet Union for clarity, but it was not until they were threatened to be reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency that the USSR fessed up to the incident; even then, however, they portrayed the disaster to be much less concerning than it was.\n\n(12). Contrary to the exact death tolls, the environmental damage from the radioactive fallout of Chernobyl is well-documented. The most known example is The Red Forest , a four-square kilometre patch of pine trees that turned brown-red and died. Traces of radioactive damage have led to gross deformities in farm animals, with nearly 350 animals being born with various deformities. This is in stark contrast to the three abnormal births that had been registered in the five years before the 4-year sample. Sheep movement in all areas of the UK was also prohibited to avoid contamination of other parts of the human food chain by radiation. It was not until 26 years later, in 2012, that all restrictions were lifted. The amount of radioactive material released by the Chernobyl incident was four hundred-fold more than the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n(13). Ultimately, the disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant had a major impact on the nuclear debate and the USSR. The completion of reactors 5 and 6 at Chernobyl was abandoned very quickly, as these shared the design flaws of reactor 4. Moreover, the need for better safety standards meant that nuclear reactors cost more to build , discouraging many investors from taking on the challenge. There was a noticeable drop in new nuclear start-ups after 1986 . Additionally, the secrecy behind the Chernobyl accident raised concerns about the safety standards within all other nuclear reactors in the Soviet Union. This led to a level of transparency that the Union did not like, ultimately making way for the collapse of the regime.\n\n(14). The historical maximum number of nuclear reactors was established in 2017 with 448. Nuclear energy is often criticized due to safety concerns and operation costs , but supporters argue for its cleanliness and sustainability. The debate on nuclear energy will likely continue for several years, though it is encouraging to observe a trend of using renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we first need to carefully read the sentence in paragraph four containing the word “catapulted” to determine the context in which it is being used. Paragraph 4 reads: “However, the unexpected shutoff of a regional power plant catapulted Chernobyl into producing power to satisfy the needs of Kyiv.” “Catapulted” is used to emphasize the fact that an emergency caused Chernobyl to remain on. It was URGENT for Chernobyl to complete the task of powering Kyiv, and thus, it was URGED (or catapulted) into fulfilling the regional power plant’s position. Thus, “urgent” would be the best replacement for the word “catapulted” in paragraph 4. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Substituted – is incorrect because substituted means used in place of another. This is not a strong enough word to describe how the unexpected shutoff of a regional plant pushed Chernobyl into producing power – thus, it is incorrect. Option B. Inspired – is incorrect because this doesn’t fit the context of paragraph 4. Inspired means motivated or stimulated, while catapult, as used in the context of paragraph 4, is a more emphatic word for push or urge. Option C. Put – is incorrect because this is not a strong enough word to describe how the unexpected shutoff of a regional plant pushed Chernobyl into producing power.",

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, it is important to note that the stem asks for what option choice goes AGAINST the author’s position - in other words, what is FALSE. To ascertain what option choice is false, we need to scan through the entire passage to determine the veracity of each option choice in the stem. In paragraph 4, the author mentions Anatoly Dyatlov. This tells us that the author WOULD agree that Dyatlov was responsible for the Chernobyl disaster. It reads: “Anatoly Dyatlov, the deputy chief engineer of the Chernobyl Power Plant...[was the] executive that propagated a series of catastrophic decisions at Chernobyl, one after the other.\" In paragraph 11, the author mentions the secrecy of the Soviet Union. This tells us that the author WOULD agree that the Soviet Union conducted their business with secrecy. It reads: “The Soviet Union intended to keep the disaster at Chernobyl a secret for as long as possible. As a result, many of the facts of the situation remain uncertain and exact numbers are still a subject of controversy.” In paragraphs 4, 10, and 11, the author hints at how the Soviet Union mismanaged their response to the Chernobyl disaster. This tells us that the author believes that the Chernobyl disaster WAS mismanaged by Soviet officials. It reads: “The evacuation of Pripyat, the city closest to Chernobyl, was not initiated until 36 hours after the first blast.” “The preparation for the safety test at Chernobyl was questionable from the very start. It was approved by the director of the plant, but his approval did not correspond with established procedures.” “The Soviet Union intended to keep the disaster at Chernobyl a secret for as long as possible. As a result, many of the facts of the situation remain uncertain and exact numbers are still a subject of controversy.” In paragraph 9, the author discusses acute radiation poisoning. This tells us that the author believes that acute radiation poisoning IS debilitating in its final stages. It reads: “The initial stage of acute radiation syndrome is followed by a latent period. During this stage, symptoms are barely noticeable for a few hours or weeks. Then, the body begins to break down through infections, bleeding, confusion, and dehydration.” In paragraph 13, the author discusses nuclear power investors. This tells us that the author would NOT agree that nuclear power investors were eager to improve emergency responses after Chernobyl. It reads: “[…] the need for better safety standards meant that nuclear reactors cost more to build, discouraging many investors from taking on the challenge. There was a noticeable drop in new nuclear start-ups after 1986.” Thus, the author would most likely disagree with the first option choice. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Anatoly Dyatlov is the foremost individual responsible for Chernobyl – is incorrect because in paragraph 4, the author says: “Anatoly Dyatlov, the deputy chief engineer of the Chernobyl Power Plant...[was the] executive that propagated a series of catastrophic decisions at Chernobyl, one after the other.” The use of the word “incompetent” implies that, in the author’s opinion, this person was solely responsible. Option C. The Soviet Union preferred to conduct its affairs with secrecy – is incorrect because this is true and can be eliminated. In paragraph eleven, it states: “The Soviet Union intended to keep the disaster a secret for as long as possible.” Option D. The Chernobyl disaster was largely mismanaged by Soviet officials – is incorrect because this is supported by the inability to follow established procedures as indicated in paragraph four, the late evacuation of Pripyat discussed in paragraph ten, and the late announcement of the disaster as stated in paragraph eleven. Therefore, Option D can also be eliminated. Option E. Acute Radiation Poisoning becomes debilitating in its later stages – is incorrect because this suggests that the final stages of ARS are very difficult, and this is true, based on the information provided in paragraph 9. Therefore, E is not the correct answer either and can thus be eliminated.",

      "text": "(1). On April 26 th , 1986, at 1:23:40 A.M., Ukraine became the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in human history. Ironically, the events of the Chernobyl disaster unfolded because of a safety test that went wrong. The actions of its test supervisor and the inherent design flaws of Chernobyl’s core reactor are largely responsible for the cataclysmic aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. The incident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is ranked in the highest class of a nuclear disaster, only matched by the nuclear disaster at Fukushima . The total estimate of the deaths due to the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl ranges from 4,000 to as high as 93,000 . The disaster became a pivotal moment in the dissolution of the USSR regime, and it gained global attention for its revolutionary impact on nuclear management.\n\n(2). The safety test at Chernobyl was designed to improve emergency response in a power outage situation; the purpose was to check if backup generators could replace the steam turbine generators in time. The electrically derived energy would have to be enough to pump water into the fuel channels for about 45 seconds, to avoid a core meltdown in the meantime.\n\n(3). In a nuclear reaction, heat is generated through fission , essentially the splitting of uranium atoms. A steam turbine then converts the energy into electricity capable of powering large cities like Kyiv , the capital of Ukraine. Uranium is stored in metal tubes called fuel rods , in a fuel assembly consisting of more than 200 tubes and the power output of the reactor determines how many assemblies are put inside the core. Inside the reactor vessel, the fuel rods are immersed in water, which acts as a coolant and moderator. Control rods are installed to provide further regulation of the reaction rate. Under normal circumstances, inserting the control rods lowers reaction rate, and removing them speeds up the reaction.\n\n(4). The preparation for the safety test at Chernobyl was questionable from the very start. It was approved by the director of the plant, but his approval did not correspond with established procedures . Furthermore, the day shift was supposed to begin the experiment the previous day, while the night shift would maintain cooling systems. However, the unexpected shutoff of a regional power plant catapulted Chernobyl into producing power to satisfy the needs of Kyiv. Anatoly Dyatlov , the deputy chief engineer of the Chernobyl Power Plant, was supervising the experiment, his rank giving him superiority over all other personnel. Dyatlov was the incompetent executive that propagated a series of catastrophic decisions at Chernobyl, one after the other.\n\n(5). The test procedure in question called for half of the normal power output, which accumulated xenon-135. Xenon-135 is a by-product of fission, and it decays into a less stable isotope under a steady state. It also inhibits the reaction rate in a process known as “reactor poisoning by absorbing neutrons.” The power output was lowered further to 500 MW before suddenly plummeting to 5% of the procedural value. The mystery behind the unexpected power drop remains unsolved, partly because the two engineers who operated the controls died of acute radiation syndrome within two weeks of the incident. To counter the rapid decline in power output, the control-room personnel removed most of the control rods from the core to get the power back up. The power output began to rise after a couple of minutes, but excessive xenon-135 build-up hampered a quick recovery, so further control rods were removed. Alarms began to sound due to low power level, core poisoning, and lack of coolant flow but were ignored to preserve the reactor level.\n\n(6). Dyatlov elected to proceed with the test when a power of 200 MW was attained, despite all the disturbing signals . Water flow into the reactor decreased because of the gradual transition from the steam turbines to the backup generators. An RMBK reactor like the one in Chernobyl has a positive void coefficient , meaning that the nuclear chain reaction entered a positive feedback loop when the water boiled into steam. As the power continued to increase, water continually flashed into steam. The emergency button pressed to insert all the control rods was the nail in the coffin; the tips of the rods were covered in graphite, which displaced water in a complex neutron interaction and increased power further. The defect in the RBMK design made it very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing power to a dangerous level. The power output spiked astronomically, and the last reading of the meter indicated a 10-fold increase over the normal levels.\n\n(7). The first explosion that occurred is believed to have been a steam explosion caused by vapor buildup. A second explosion followed shortly after, sending pieces of radioactive graphite through the roof of the building of reactor-4. The most immediate concern was to extinguish the fire on the roof of reactor-4 before it spread to reactor-3. The fire within the reactor core had to be contained with clay, sand, and lead.\n\n(8). The nex t stage of damage control was to drain the water tanks below the reactor to prevent another steam explosion. After the tank valves were opened, miners were called to dig tunnels below the reactor and fill it with concrete to support the reactor’s core foundation. The last step was the removal of radioactive debris from the rooftop of reactor- 4, so that safe confinement could be built around the reactor. When robotic trials proved unsuccessful due to immense radiation, thousands of workers collaborated in 45-90 second trips to complete the task.\n\n(9). Reactor employees were exposed to lethal levels of radiation in minutes, while hundreds of firefighters and pilots risked their lives to contain the fires. In its initial stages, acute radiation syndrome is characterized by tasting metal or feeling pins and needles on the face, symptoms that most firefighters reported experiencing on site. The initial stage of acute radiation syndrome is followed by a latent period. During this stage, symptoms are barely noticeable for a few hours or weeks. Then, the body begins to break down through infections, bleeding, confusion, and dehydration. Recovery is possible, although an overwhelming majority of Chernobyl workers passed due to severe exposure to radiation.\n\n(10). The evacuation of Pripyat , the city closest to Chernobyl, was not initiated until 36 hours after the first blast. Although the residents were told that the evacuation would be temporary and to only carry the most important belongings with themselves, within a week, the exclusion zone was extended to 30 kilometres and 350,000 people were permanently displaced.\n\n(11). The Soviet Union intended to keep the disaster at Chernobyl a secret for as long as possible. As a result, many of the facts of the situation remain uncertain and exact numbers are still a subject of controversy. The Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, a nuclear plant in Sweden that detected radiation levels from over 1,000 miles away, unmasked the Soviet’s sinister plan. They noticed radioactive particles on their suits and contacted the Soviet Union for clarity, but it was not until they were threatened to be reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency that the USSR fessed up to the incident; even then, however, they portrayed the disaster to be much less concerning than it was.\n\n(12). Contrary to the exact death tolls, the environmental damage from the radioactive fallout of Chernobyl is well-documented. The most known example is The Red Forest , a four-square kilometre patch of pine trees that turned brown-red and died. Traces of radioactive damage have led to gross deformities in farm animals, with nearly 350 animals being born with various deformities. This is in stark contrast to the three abnormal births that had been registered in the five years before the 4-year sample. Sheep movement in all areas of the UK was also prohibited to avoid contamination of other parts of the human food chain by radiation. It was not until 26 years later, in 2012, that all restrictions were lifted. The amount of radioactive material released by the Chernobyl incident was four hundred-fold more than the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n(13). Ultimately, the disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant had a major impact on the nuclear debate and the USSR. The completion of reactors 5 and 6 at Chernobyl was abandoned very quickly, as these shared the design flaws of reactor 4. Moreover, the need for better safety standards meant that nuclear reactors cost more to build , discouraging many investors from taking on the challenge.

The incident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is ranked in the highest class of a nuclear disaster, only matched by the nuclear disaster at Fukushima . The total estimate of the deaths due to the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl ranges from 4,000 to as high as 93,000 . The disaster became a pivotal moment in the dissolution of the USSR regime, and it gained global attention for its revolutionary impact on nuclear management.\n\n(2). The safety test at Chernobyl was designed to improve emergency response in a power outage situation; the purpose was to check if backup generators could replace the steam turbine generators in time. The electrically derived energy would have to be enough to pump water into the fuel channels for about 45 seconds, to avoid a core meltdown in the meantime.\n\n(3). In a nuclear reaction, heat is generated through fission , essentially the splitting of uranium atoms. A steam turbine then converts the energy into electricity capable of powering large cities like Kyiv , the capital of Ukraine. Uranium is stored in metal tubes called fuel rods , in a fuel assembly consisting of more than 200 tubes and the power output of the reactor determines how many assemblies are put inside the core. Inside the reactor vessel, the fuel rods are immersed in water, which acts as a coolant and moderator. Control rods are installed to provide further regulation of the reaction rate. Under normal circumstances, inserting the control rods lowers reaction rate, and removing them speeds up the reaction.\n\n(4). The preparation for the safety test at Chernobyl was questionable from the very start. It was approved by the director of the plant, but his approval did not correspond with established procedures . Furthermore, the day shift was supposed to begin the experiment the previous day, while the night shift would maintain cooling systems. However, the unexpected shutoff of a regional power plant catapulted Chernobyl into producing power to satisfy the needs of Kyiv. Anatoly Dyatlov , the deputy chief engineer of the Chernobyl Power Plant, was supervising the experiment, his rank giving him superiority over all other personnel. Dyatlov was the incompetent executive that propagated a series of catastrophic decisions at Chernobyl, one after the other.\n\n(5). The test procedure in question called for half of the normal power output, which accumulated xenon-135. Xenon-135 is a by-product of fission, and it decays into a less stable isotope under a steady state. It also inhibits the reaction rate in a process known as “reactor poisoning by absorbing neutrons.” The power output was lowered further to 500 MW before suddenly plummeting to 5% of the procedural value. The mystery behind the unexpected power drop remains unsolved, partly because the two engineers who operated the controls died of acute radiation syndrome within two weeks of the incident. To counter the rapid decline in power output, the control-room personnel removed most of the control rods from the core to get the power back up. The power output began to rise after a couple of minutes, but excessive xenon-135 build-up hampered a quick recovery, so further control rods were removed. Alarms began to sound due to low power level, core poisoning, and lack of coolant flow but were ignored to preserve the reactor level.\n\n(6). Dyatlov elected to proceed with the test when a power of 200 MW was attained, despite all the disturbing signals . Water flow into the reactor decreased because of the gradual transition from the steam turbines to the backup generators. An RMBK reactor like the one in Chernobyl has a positive void coefficient , meaning that the nuclear chain reaction entered a positive feedback loop when the water boiled into steam. As the power continued to increase, water continually flashed into steam. The emergency button pressed to insert all the control rods was the nail in the coffin; the tips of the rods were covered in graphite, which displaced water in a complex neutron interaction and increased power further. The defect in the RBMK design made it very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing power to a dangerous level. The power output spiked astronomically, and the last reading of the meter indicated a 10-fold increase over the normal levels.\n\n(7). The first explosion that occurred is believed to have been a steam explosion caused by vapor buildup. A second explosion followed shortly after, sending pieces of radioactive graphite through the roof of the building of reactor-4. The most immediate concern was to extinguish the fire on the roof of reactor-4 before it spread to reactor-3. The fire within the reactor core had to be contained with clay, sand, and lead.\n\n(8). The nex t stage of damage control was to drain the water tanks below the reactor to prevent another steam explosion. After the tank valves were opened, miners were called to dig tunnels below the reactor and fill it with concrete to support the reactor’s core foundation. The last step was the removal of radioactive debris from the rooftop of reactor- 4, so that safe confinement could be built around the reactor. When robotic trials proved unsuccessful due to immense radiation, thousands of workers collaborated in 45-90 second trips to complete the task.\n\n(9). Reactor employees were exposed to lethal levels of radiation in minutes, while hundreds of firefighters and pilots risked their lives to contain the fires. In its initial stages, acute radiation syndrome is characterized by tasting metal or feeling pins and needles on the face, symptoms that most firefighters reported experiencing on site. The initial stage of acute radiation syndrome is followed by a latent period. During this stage, symptoms are barely noticeable for a few hours or weeks. Then, the body begins to break down through infections, bleeding, confusion, and dehydration. Recovery is possible, although an overwhelming majority of Chernobyl workers passed due to severe exposure to radiation.\n\n(10). The evacuation of Pripyat , the city closest to Chernobyl, was not initiated until 36 hours after the first blast. Although the residents were told that the evacuation would be temporary and to only carry the most important belongings with themselves, within a week, the exclusion zone was extended to 30 kilometres and 350,000 people were permanently displaced.\n\n(11). The Soviet Union intended to keep the disaster at Chernobyl a secret for as long as possible. As a result, many of the facts of the situation remain uncertain and exact numbers are still a subject of controversy. The Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, a nuclear plant in Sweden that detected radiation levels from over 1,000 miles away, unmasked the Soviet’s sinister plan. They noticed radioactive particles on their suits and contacted the Soviet Union for clarity, but it was not until they were threatened to be reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency that the USSR fessed up to the incident; even then, however, they portrayed the disaster to be much less concerning than it was.\n\n(12). Contrary to the exact death tolls, the environmental damage from the radioactive fallout of Chernobyl is well-documented. The most known example is The Red Forest , a four-square kilometre patch of pine trees that turned brown-red and died. Traces of radioactive damage have led to gross deformities in farm animals, with nearly 350 animals being born with various deformities. This is in stark contrast to the three abnormal births that had been registered in the five years before the 4-year sample. Sheep movement in all areas of the UK was also prohibited to avoid contamination of other parts of the human food chain by radiation. It was not until 26 years later, in 2012, that all restrictions were lifted. The amount of radioactive material released by the Chernobyl incident was four hundred-fold more than the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n(13). Ultimately, the disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant had a major impact on the nuclear debate and the USSR. The completion of reactors 5 and 6 at Chernobyl was abandoned very quickly, as these shared the design flaws of reactor 4. Moreover, the need for better safety standards meant that nuclear reactors cost more to build , discouraging many investors from taking on the challenge. There was a noticeable drop in new nuclear start-ups after 1986 . Additionally, the secrecy behind the Chernobyl accident raised concerns about the safety standards within all other nuclear reactors in the Soviet Union. This led to a level of transparency that the Union did not like, ultimately making way for the collapse of the regime.\n\n(14). The historical maximum number of nuclear reactors was established in 2017 with 448. Nuclear energy is often criticized due to safety concerns and operation costs , but supporters argue for its cleanliness and sustainability. The debate on nuclear energy will likely continue for several years, though it is encouraging to observe a trend of using renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels."
