      "text": "(1). On August 6th, 1881, Alexander Fleming was born to Hugh Fleming and Grace Stirling Morton in Lochfield Farm, Scotland. Initially schooled in Scotland, Fleming eventually moved to London, along with his three brothers and sister. He completed his youth education at the Regent Street Polytechnic but did not enter medical school immediately after; instead, Fleming worked in a shipping office for four years. When Fleming’s uncle died, the latter willed equal shares of his estate to his siblings, nieces, and nephews, and Fleming was able to use his share to pursue a medical education. In 1906, he graduated with distinction from St. Mary’s Medical School at London University.\n\n(2). Fleming did not intend to begin a career in research. While serving as a private in the London Scottish Regiment of the Territorial Army, he became a recognized marksman. However, wishing to keep Fleming in St. Mary’s to join its rifle club, the club’s captain convinced him to pursue a career in research rather than surgery, as the latter would require him to leave St. Mary’s. The captain introduced him to Sir Almroth Wright, a keen rifle club member and a pioneer in immunology and vaccine research. Wright agreed to take Fleming under his wing, and it was with Wright’s research group that Fleming would remain throughout his entire career.\n\n(3). When World War I broke out, Fleming served in the Army Medical Corps as a captain. During this time, he observed the death of many of his fellow soldiers, not always from wounds inflicted in battle but from the ensuing and uncontrollable infection resulting from these wounds. The primary means to combat an infection was antiseptics, which frequently did more harm than good; in an article, he wrote during his time in the Army Medical Corps, Fleming discussed the presence of anaerobic bacteria in deep wounds, which proliferated despite the use of antiseptics. Initially, Fleming’s research was not accepted, but Fleming continued undaunted, and in 1922 he discovered lysozyme, an enzyme with weak antibacterial properties.\n\n(4). History tells us that, while infected with a cold, Fleming transferred some of his nasopharyngeal mucus onto a Petri dish. Not known for fastidious laboratory organization, Fleming placed the dish amongst the clutter on his desk and left it there, forgotten, for two weeks. During that time, numerous colonies of bacteria grew and proliferated; however, the area where the mucus was inoculated remained clear. Upon further investigation, Fleming discovered the presence of a substance in the mucus which inhibited bacterial growth. He named it lysozyme and soon discovered its presence could be found in tears, saliva, skin, hair, and fingernails. Soon, he was able to isolate large amounts of lysozyme from egg whites, but in subsequent experiments, he found that this enzyme was effective against only a small number of non-harmful bacteria. Nevertheless, these findings would lay the groundwork for Fleming’s next great discovery.\n\n(5). In 1928, Fleming began a series of experiments involving the common staphylococcal bacteria. When an uncovered Petri dish sitting next to an open window became contaminated with mold spores, Fleming observed that bacteria in proximity to the mold colonies were dying, as evidenced by the surrounding agar gel, which was dissolving and clearing. Fleming was able to isolate the mold near the dying bacteria and identified it as a member of the Penicillium genus. He found the mold was effective against all Gram-positive pathogens (these are pathogens responsible for diseases such as scarlet fever, pneumonia, gonorrhea, meningitis, and diphtheria). Fleming discerned that it was not the mold itself but some juice it had produced that had killed the bacteria. He named the “mold juice” penicillin. Later, he would say: “When I woke up just after dawn on September 28th, 1928, I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did.”\n\n(6). Fleming’s accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marked the start of modern antibiotics. Before that, many scientists had pointed out that mold (or Penicillium sp.) inhibited bacterial growth and even cured bacterial infections in animals. However, Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating penicillin, as well as being motivated enough to promote his discovery on a larger scale. Early on, Fleming also discovered that bacterium develops antibiotic resistance whenever too little penicillin is used, or when it is used for too short of a period. Almroth Wright predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noted during experiments, and Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in the many speeches he gave around the world, though he warned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason and that if it is used, never to use too little, or to use it for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.\n\n(7). Although Fleming published his initial discovery of penicillin in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in 1929, the scientific community initially greeted his work with little enthusiasm; additionally, Fleming found it difficult to isolate the aforementioned “mold juice” in large quantities. It was not until 1940, just as Fleming was contemplating retirement, that two scientists, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain developed an interest in penicillin. In time, penicillin was able to be mass-produced for use during World War II.\n\n(8). Fleming received many awards for his achievements. In 1928, he became a Professor of Bacteriology at St. Mary’s Medical School. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1943 and elevated to the level of Emeritus Professor of Bacteriology at the University of London in 1948. A recipient of around thirty honorary degrees, he won the most prestigious award of all in 1945: The Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine. Fleming was made a Knight Bachelor by King George VI in 1944 and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Alfonso X the Wise in 1948. Additionally, Time Magazine named him one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.\n\n(9). Fleming was a quiet, patient, and modest gentleman who was not given to displays of emotion and had a natural shyness that made him avoid accolades and attention. He could be silent to the point of being inscrutable, making it difficult for even his wife and closest friends to gauge his moods and desires. Fleming was occasionally brusque and aloof, yet charming and gentle among friends and loved ones. In 1915, he married an Irish-born nurse named Sarah Marion McElroy, who went by the nickname of Sareen; after nine years of marriage, they had a son named Robert Fleming, who became a general practitioner. Sareen died after 34 years of marriage; her death affected Fleming profoundly. Subsequently, he buried himself in his work, spending long hours behind the closed doors of his laboratory. A biographer wrote: “As if overnight, Fleming, with red-rimmed eyes and trembling hands, seemed to have become an old man.” Nonetheless, in 1953 Fleming remarried Dr. Amalia Koutsouri-Vourekas, the wedding taking place in a Greek church in London.\n\n(10). On March 11, 1955, Alexander Fleming suddenly died of coronary thrombosis at home. He had been suffering from what he perceived to be gastric upset for some weeks, but when his wife called the family physician regarding Fleming’s onset of nausea on March 11, the doctor reassured them that a house visit was not necessary. However, within minutes Fleming succumbed to the coronary thrombosis. His cremated ashes were placed in St. Paul’s Cathedral, and “[h]e died as he wished; quietly, without a gradual decline in physical or mental capacity, and even without inconveniencing his physician.”\n\n(11). Prior to the introduction of penicillin and, thus, effective antibiotics, there existed no functional cure for many life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. Furthermore, when individuals sought treatment for blood infections borne from cuts, doctors possessed little ability to aid these individuals in healing, meaning that such infections were much more likely to end in fatality. During this time, giving birth also carried a much higher risk, with streptococcus pyogenes causing 50 percent of postpartum deaths in new mothers. Illnesses that are considered low-risk and relatively common in today’s world were much graver before the dawn of effective antimicrobials, surgeries carried enormous risk, and life expectancy was lower, given that diseases such as smallpox, typhus, and diphtheria—to name but a few—were largely incurable and ran unchecked throughout society. Additionally, tools that we rely on to cure illnesses in the modern world, such as chemotherapy, would be out of the question without the presence of antibiotics.\n\n(12). Fleming’s discovery of penicillin changed the world of modern medicine by ushering in the age of impactful antibiotics. The introduction of penicillin marked the beginning of the so-called golden era of antibiotics - between 1940 and 1962, most of the antibiotic classes we use as medicines today were discovered and introduced to the market. Each class typically contains several antibiotics that have been discovered over time or are modified versions of previous types. There are, for example, numerous β-lactams (pronounced beta-lactams), including different types of penicillin and cephalosporins. Today, there are very few novel antibiotics under development, but at the same time, r antibiotic-resistant bacteria are becoming more and more prevalent, thus making currently available antibiotics ineffective. As a result, we are facing a major and inevitable health problem. Nonetheless, penicillin has, and still is, saving millions of lives around the world.\n\n(13). When the microorganisms that cause disease develop defenses against the agents that are harmful to them, this is known as antimicrobial resistance. The germs that cause many common illnesses have the capacity to adapt and thus withstand the effects of antibiotics. When these viruses adapt in such a way, they create a new variation of themselves, which spreads and can become fully resistant to antibiotic treatment. This is a growing problem that causes millions of deaths per year. The virus that causes tuberculosis is evidence of this, with antimicrobial forms of the pathogen becoming more commonplace. If such drug-resistant viruses continue to proliferate and no effective solution is put in place, the spread of lethal pathogens could be a serious and very real issue that medical professionals and society at large will have to contend with. However, there are ways to slow the spread of antimicrobial-resistant viruses, including the correct disposal of antibiotics, the proper prescribing of these drugs by medical professionals, and exercising caution when self-medicating with such drugs."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should first isolate the paragraph or paragraphs that mention Fleming’s publication of his initial discovery. Logically, we can presume that such a paragraph or paragraphs will fall somewhere around the middle of the passage, as Fleming’s initial publication of his discoveries would succeed the actual act of his discovery , but based on the word “initial,” precede later discoveries. In paragraph 7, the author mentions the statement below. This tells us that the scientific community did not show eagerness for Fleming’s initial work. Therefore, the first statement in the question is false. “ Although Fleming published his initial discovery of penicillin in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in 1929, the scientific community initially greeted his work with little enthusiasm” To ascertain whether the second statement is true or false, we should locate the paragraph or paragraphs in the passage that discuss the types of bacteria that mold spores are effective against . If we note that this information was central to Fleming’s work, and the passage is based primarily on Fleming’s work, we can logically presume that it will be discussed relatively early in the passage. In paragraph 5, the author mentions the statement below. This tells us that Fleming discovered mold spores to be effective against several pathogens, including meningitis . Therefore, the second statement in the question is true. “He found the mold was effective against all Gram-positive pathogens (these are pathogens responsible for diseases such as scarlet fever, pneumonia, gonorrhea, meningitis, and diphtheria).” Thus, the first statement is FALSE, and the second is TRUE. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",

The first statement is TRUE, the second is FALSE – is incorrect because the first statement is false, the second is true. In the seventh paragraph, the author mentions that Alexander Fleming’s work wasn’t met with enthusiasm. The second statement can be verified as true by reading the 5th paragraph of the passage, which states that mold spores, which are members of the Penicillium genus, are effective against all Gram-positive pathogens, such as meningitis.",

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, consider the use of the phrase “Fleming’s early life” in the question. This tells us that the event being discussed happened when Fleming was young, meaning that it is most likely mentioned at an early point in the passage. Additionally, the question states that the event that marked the turning point in Fleming’s life led him to pursue science, meaning that this event preceded Fleming’s famous discoveries. As most of the passage discusses Fleming’s discoveries, we can once more conclude that any facet of his life which came before such discoveries will be discussed early in the passage. Indeed, paragraph 2 reads: “ Fleming did not intend to begin a career in research. While serving as a private in the London Scottish Regiment of the Territorial Army, he became a recognized marksman. However, wishing to keep Fleming in St. Mary’s to join its rifle club, the club’s captain convinced him to pursue a career in research rather than surgery, as the latter would require him to leave St. Mary’s. The captain introduced him to Sir Almroth Wright, a keen rifle club member and a pioneer in immunology and vaccine research. Wright agreed to take Fleming under his wing, and it was with Wright’s research group that Fleming would remain throughout his entire career.” This paragraph tells us that Fleming would likely not have pursued a career in research had it not been for the club’s captain convincing him to choose research over surgery and introducing him to Sir Almoth Wright. It goes on to say that Fleming remained with Wright’s research group for his entire career. Thus, meeting Almoth Wright marked a significant turning point in Fleming’s early life. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. When he decided to pursue research with a private organization – is incorrect because, while this may be how Fleming entered science, it is not the event that caused it. If Fleming had not met Wright, he would not have had the resources to pursue research. Option C. When he met his wife, who loved him dearly but was terrified of his job – is incorrect because this option choice has no evidence supporting it based on the passage. Option D. When he discovered antiseptics could be used for good – is incorrect because Fleming was first directed towards science, after which he made his discovery. Additionally, Fleming discovered antibiotics, not antiseptics. Option E. When he invented the term “mold juice” – is incorrect because Fleming was directed towards science before he came up with this term.",

Nevertheless, these findings would lay the groundwork for Fleming’s next great discovery.\n\n(5). In 1928, Fleming began a series of experiments involving the common staphylococcal bacteria. When an uncovered Petri dish sitting next to an open window became contaminated with mold spores, Fleming observed that bacteria in proximity to the mold colonies were dying, as evidenced by the surrounding agar gel, which was dissolving and clearing. Fleming was able to isolate the mold near the dying bacteria and identified it as a member of the Penicillium genus. He found the mold was effective against all Gram-positive pathogens (these are pathogens responsible for diseases such as scarlet fever, pneumonia, gonorrhea, meningitis, and diphtheria). Fleming discerned that it was not the mold itself but some juice it had produced that had killed the bacteria. He named the “mold juice” penicillin. Later, he would say: “When I woke up just after dawn on September 28th, 1928, I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did.”\n\n(6). Fleming’s accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marked the start of modern antibiotics. Before that, many scientists had pointed out that mold (or Penicillium sp.) inhibited bacterial growth and even cured bacterial infections in animals. However, Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating penicillin, as well as being motivated enough to promote his discovery on a larger scale. Early on, Fleming also discovered that bacterium develops antibiotic resistance whenever too little penicillin is used, or when it is used for too short of a period. Almroth Wright predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noted during experiments, and Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in the many speeches he gave around the world, though he warned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason and that if it is used, never to use too little, or to use it for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.\n\n(7). Although Fleming published his initial discovery of penicillin in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in 1929, the scientific community initially greeted his work with little enthusiasm; additionally, Fleming found it difficult to isolate the aforementioned “mold juice” in large quantities. It was not until 1940, just as Fleming was contemplating retirement, that two scientists, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain developed an interest in penicillin. In time, penicillin was able to be mass-produced for use during World War II.\n\n(8). Fleming received many awards for his achievements. In 1928, he became a Professor of Bacteriology at St. Mary’s Medical School. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1943 and elevated to the level of Emeritus Professor of Bacteriology at the University of London in 1948. A recipient of around thirty honorary degrees, he won the most prestigious award of all in 1945: The Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine. Fleming was made a Knight Bachelor by King George VI in 1944 and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Alfonso X the Wise in 1948. Additionally, Time Magazine named him one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.\n\n(9). Fleming was a quiet, patient, and modest gentleman who was not given to displays of emotion and had a natural shyness that made him avoid accolades and attention. He could be silent to the point of being inscrutable, making it difficult for even his wife and closest friends to gauge his moods and desires. Fleming was occasionally brusque and aloof, yet charming and gentle among friends and loved ones. In 1915, he married an Irish-born nurse named Sarah Marion McElroy, who went by the nickname of Sareen; after nine years of marriage, they had a son named Robert Fleming, who became a general practitioner. Sareen died after 34 years of marriage; her death affected Fleming profoundly. Subsequently, he buried himself in his work, spending long hours behind the closed doors of his laboratory. A biographer wrote: “As if overnight, Fleming, with red-rimmed eyes and trembling hands, seemed to have become an old man.” Nonetheless, in 1953 Fleming remarried Dr. Amalia Koutsouri-Vourekas, the wedding taking place in a Greek church in London.\n\n(10). On March 11, 1955, Alexander Fleming suddenly died of coronary thrombosis at home. He had been suffering from what he perceived to be gastric upset for some weeks, but when his wife called the family physician regarding Fleming’s onset of nausea on March 11, the doctor reassured them that a house visit was not necessary. However, within minutes Fleming succumbed to the coronary thrombosis. His cremated ashes were placed in St. Paul’s Cathedral, and “[h]e died as he wished; quietly, without a gradual decline in physical or mental capacity, and even without inconveniencing his physician.”\n\n(11). Prior to the introduction of penicillin and, thus, effective antibiotics, there existed no functional cure for many life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. Furthermore, when individuals sought treatment for blood infections borne from cuts, doctors possessed little ability to aid these individuals in healing, meaning that such infections were much more likely to end in fatality. During this time, giving birth also carried a much higher risk, with streptococcus pyogenes causing 50 percent of postpartum deaths in new mothers. Illnesses that are considered low-risk and relatively common in today’s world were much graver before the dawn of effective antimicrobials, surgeries carried enormous risk, and life expectancy was lower, given that diseases such as smallpox, typhus, and diphtheria—to name but a few—were largely incurable and ran unchecked throughout society. Additionally, tools that we rely on to cure illnesses in the modern world, such as chemotherapy, would be out of the question without the presence of antibiotics.\n\n(12). Fleming’s discovery of penicillin changed the world of modern medicine by ushering in the age of impactful antibiotics. The introduction of penicillin marked the beginning of the so-called golden era of antibiotics - between 1940 and 1962, most of the antibiotic classes we use as medicines today were discovered and introduced to the market. Each class typically contains several antibiotics that have been discovered over time or are modified versions of previous types. There are, for example, numerous β-lactams (pronounced beta-lactams), including different types of penicillin and cephalosporins. Today, there are very few novel antibiotics under development, but at the same time, r antibiotic-resistant bacteria are becoming more and more prevalent, thus making currently available antibiotics ineffective. As a result, we are facing a major and inevitable health problem. Nonetheless, penicillin has, and still is, saving millions of lives around the world.\n\n(13). When the microorganisms that cause disease develop defenses against the agents that are harmful to them, this is known as antimicrobial resistance. The germs that cause many common illnesses have the capacity to adapt and thus withstand the effects of antibiotics. When these viruses adapt in such a way, they create a new variation of themselves, which spreads and can become fully resistant to antibiotic treatment. This is a growing problem that causes millions of deaths per year. The virus that causes tuberculosis is evidence of this, with antimicrobial forms of the pathogen becoming more commonplace. If such drug-resistant viruses continue to proliferate and no effective solution is put in place, the spread of lethal pathogens could be a serious and very real issue that medical professionals and society at large will have to contend with. However, there are ways to slow the spread of antimicrobial-resistant viruses, including the correct disposal of antibiotics, the proper prescribing of these drugs by medical professionals, and exercising caution when self-medicating with such drugs."

Paragraph 6 reads: “Before...many scientists had pointed out that mold (or Penicillium sp.) inhibited bacterial growth and even cured bacterial infections in animals. However, Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating penicillin, as well as being motivated enough to promote his discovery on a larger scale.” Since the question at hand asks us about the difference between Fleming’s discoveries and the discoveries of previous scientists, we should compare what paragraph 6 says regarding Fleming and past scientists and ascertain the difference. Note the word “however” in paragraph 6. This word signifies that the following comparison will be made, and the information which precedes and succeeds this word will be contrasting in nature.  Preceding “however” the paragraph tells us that scientists before Fleming had pointed out the ability of mold to inhibit bacteria growth. Succeeding “however,” the paragraph tells us that Fleming was the first to isolate penicillin and promote his studies to a large audience. Thus, one of the ways in which Fleming’s discovery was different from that of earlier scientists was that his discovery was publicized to an audience of a more substantial size. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. He was able to publish his findings – is incorrect because in the sixth paragraph, the author states that “many scientists had published or pointed out that mold, or Penicillium sp., inhibited bacterial growth.” Thus, Fleming was not unique in his publishing of research.

He was the first to obtain statistically significant results – is incorrect because in the sixth paragraph, the author states: “Many scientists had published or pointed out that mold, or Penicillium sp., inhibited bacterial growth and even cured bacterial infections in animals.” This implies that many other scientists obtained statistically significant results enough to publish; thus, Fleming was not different in this area. Option D. He was able to convince key scientists of the importance of his discovery – is incorrect because in the sixth paragraph, the author states: “Many scientists had published or pointed out that mold, or Penicillium sp., inhibited bacterial growth and even cure bacterial infections in animals.” This implies that many scientists already knew the importance of Penicillium sp., so Fleming was not the one who convinced them of this.

      "text": "(1). On August 6th, 1881, Alexander Fleming was born to Hugh Fleming and Grace Stirling Morton in Lochfield Farm, Scotland. Initially schooled in Scotland, Fleming eventually moved to London, along with his three brothers and sister. He completed his youth education at the Regent Street Polytechnic but did not enter medical school immediately after; instead, Fleming worked in a shipping office for four years. When Fleming’s uncle died, the latter willed equal shares of his estate to his siblings, nieces, and nephews, and Fleming was able to use his share to pursue a medical education. In 1906, he graduated with distinction from St. Mary’s Medical School at London University.\n\n(2). Fleming did not intend to begin a career in research. While serving as a private in the London Scottish Regiment of the Territorial Army, he became a recognized marksman. However, wishing to keep Fleming in St. Mary’s to join its rifle club, the club’s captain convinced him to pursue a career in research rather than surgery, as the latter would require him to leave St. Mary’s. The captain introduced him to Sir Almroth Wright, a keen rifle club member and a pioneer in immunology and vaccine research. Wright agreed to take Fleming under his wing, and it was with Wright’s research group that Fleming would remain throughout his entire career.\n\n(3). When World War I broke out, Fleming served in the Army Medical Corps as a captain. During this time, he observed the death of many of his fellow soldiers, not always from wounds inflicted in battle but from the ensuing and uncontrollable infection resulting from these wounds. The primary means to combat an infection was antiseptics, which frequently did more harm than good; in an article, he wrote during his time in the Army Medical Corps, Fleming discussed the presence of anaerobic bacteria in deep wounds, which proliferated despite the use of antiseptics. Initially, Fleming’s research was not accepted, but Fleming continued undaunted, and in 1922 he discovered lysozyme, an enzyme with weak antibacterial properties.\n\n(4). History tells us that, while infected with a cold, Fleming transferred some of his nasopharyngeal mucus onto a Petri dish. Not known for fastidious laboratory organization, Fleming placed the dish amongst the clutter on his desk and left it there, forgotten, for two weeks. During that time, numerous colonies of bacteria grew and proliferated; however, the area where the mucus was inoculated remained clear. Upon further investigation, Fleming discovered the presence of a substance in the mucus which inhibited bacterial growth. He named it lysozyme and soon discovered its presence could be found in tears, saliva, skin, hair, and fingernails. Soon, he was able to isolate large amounts of lysozyme from egg whites, but in subsequent experiments, he found that this enzyme was effective against only a small number of non-harmful bacteria. Nevertheless, these findings would lay the groundwork for Fleming’s next great discovery.\n\n(5). In 1928, Fleming began a series of experiments involving the common staphylococcal bacteria.

Fleming was a quiet, patient, and modest gentleman who was not given to displays of emotion and had a natural shyness that made him avoid accolades and attention. He could be silent to the point of being inscrutable, making it difficult for even his wife and closest friends to gauge his moods and desires. Fleming was occasionally brusque and aloof, yet charming and gentle among friends and loved ones. In 1915, he married an Irish-born nurse named Sarah Marion McElroy, who went by the nickname of Sareen; after nine years of marriage, they had a son named Robert Fleming, who became a general practitioner. Sareen died after 34 years of marriage; her death affected Fleming profoundly. Subsequently, he buried himself in his work, spending long hours behind the closed doors of his laboratory. A biographer wrote: “As if overnight, Fleming, with red-rimmed eyes and trembling hands, seemed to have become an old man.” Nonetheless, in 1953 Fleming remarried Dr. Amalia Koutsouri-Vourekas, the wedding taking place in a Greek church in London.\n\n(10). On March 11, 1955, Alexander Fleming suddenly died of coronary thrombosis at home. He had been suffering from what he perceived to be gastric upset for some weeks, but when his wife called the family physician regarding Fleming’s onset of nausea on March 11, the doctor reassured them that a house visit was not necessary. However, within minutes Fleming succumbed to the coronary thrombosis. His cremated ashes were placed in St. Paul’s Cathedral, and “[h]e died as he wished; quietly, without a gradual decline in physical or mental capacity, and even without inconveniencing his physician.”\n\n(11). Prior to the introduction of penicillin and, thus, effective antibiotics, there existed no functional cure for many life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. Furthermore, when individuals sought treatment for blood infections borne from cuts, doctors possessed little ability to aid these individuals in healing, meaning that such infections were much more likely to end in fatality. During this time, giving birth also carried a much higher risk, with streptococcus pyogenes causing 50 percent of postpartum deaths in new mothers. Illnesses that are considered low-risk and relatively common in today’s world were much graver before the dawn of effective antimicrobials, surgeries carried enormous risk, and life expectancy was lower, given that diseases such as smallpox, typhus, and diphtheria—to name but a few—were largely incurable and ran unchecked throughout society. Additionally, tools that we rely on to cure illnesses in the modern world, such as chemotherapy, would be out of the question without the presence of antibiotics.\n\n(12). Fleming’s discovery of penicillin changed the world of modern medicine by ushering in the age of impactful antibiotics. The introduction of penicillin marked the beginning of the so-called golden era of antibiotics - between 1940 and 1962, most of the antibiotic classes we use as medicines today were discovered and introduced to the market. Each class typically contains several antibiotics that have been discovered over time or are modified versions of previous types. There are, for example, numerous β-lactams (pronounced beta-lactams), including different types of penicillin and cephalosporins. Today, there are very few novel antibiotics under development, but at the same time, r antibiotic-resistant bacteria are becoming more and more prevalent, thus making currently available antibiotics ineffective. As a result, we are facing a major and inevitable health problem. Nonetheless, penicillin has, and still is, saving millions of lives around the world.\n\n(13). When the microorganisms that cause disease develop defenses against the agents that are harmful to them, this is known as antimicrobial resistance. The germs that cause many common illnesses have the capacity to adapt and thus withstand the effects of antibiotics. When these viruses adapt in such a way, they create a new variation of themselves, which spreads and can become fully resistant to antibiotic treatment. This is a growing problem that causes millions of deaths per year. The virus that causes tuberculosis is evidence of this, with antimicrobial forms of the pathogen becoming more commonplace. If such drug-resistant viruses continue to proliferate and no effective solution is put in place, the spread of lethal pathogens could be a serious and very real issue that medical professionals and society at large will have to contend with. However, there are ways to slow the spread of antimicrobial-resistant viruses, including the correct disposal of antibiotics, the proper prescribing of these drugs by medical professionals, and exercising caution when self-medicating with such drugs."

We can presume that these are the paragraphs that will discuss his personality since such information would be largely unrelated to his scientific work and thus, would likely not be included in any paragraphs discussing his research. Paragraph 9 discusses Fleming’s personal life in-depth and reads: “Fleming was a quiet, patient, and modest gentleman who was not given to displays of emotion and had a natural shyness that made him avoid accolades and attention.” Altogether, this tells us that Fleming was an unassuming and humble person. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",

Arrogant and bold – is incorrect because this is the opposite of how Fleming is portrayed in the passage. In paragraph 9, Fleming is described as modest. Option D. Nervous and unorganized – is incorrect because, while the state of Fleming’s lab indicated that he was unorganized, he was not shown to be nervous in the passage. Instead, Fleming is described as modest. Option E. Energetic and modest – is incorrect because, while certainly modest, Fleming is not portrayed as being energetic in the passage.",

      "text": "(1). On August 6th, 1881, Alexander Fleming was born to Hugh Fleming and Grace Stirling Morton in Lochfield Farm, Scotland. Initially schooled in Scotland, Fleming eventually moved to London, along with his three brothers and sister. He completed his youth education at the Regent Street Polytechnic but did not enter medical school immediately after; instead, Fleming worked in a shipping office for four years. When Fleming’s uncle died, the latter willed equal shares of his estate to his siblings, nieces, and nephews, and Fleming was able to use his share to pursue a medical education. In 1906, he graduated with distinction from St. Mary’s Medical School at London University.\n\n(2). Fleming did not intend to begin a career in research. While serving as a private in the London Scottish Regiment of the Territorial Army, he became a recognized marksman. However, wishing to keep Fleming in St. Mary’s to join its rifle club, the club’s captain convinced him to pursue a career in research rather than surgery, as the latter would require him to leave St. Mary’s. The captain introduced him to Sir Almroth Wright, a keen rifle club member and a pioneer in immunology and vaccine research. Wright agreed to take Fleming under his wing, and it was with Wright’s research group that Fleming would remain throughout his entire career.\n\n(3). When World War I broke out, Fleming served in the Army Medical Corps as a captain. During this time, he observed the death of many of his fellow soldiers, not always from wounds inflicted in battle but from the ensuing and uncontrollable infection resulting from these wounds. The primary means to combat an infection was antiseptics, which frequently did more harm than good; in an article, he wrote during his time in the Army Medical Corps, Fleming discussed the presence of anaerobic bacteria in deep wounds, which proliferated despite the use of antiseptics. Initially, Fleming’s research was not accepted, but Fleming continued undaunted, and in 1922 he discovered lysozyme, an enzyme with weak antibacterial properties.\n\n(4). History tells us that, while infected with a cold, Fleming transferred some of his nasopharyngeal mucus onto a Petri dish. Not known for fastidious laboratory organization, Fleming placed the dish amongst the clutter on his desk and left it there, forgotten, for two weeks. During that time, numerous colonies of bacteria grew and proliferated; however, the area where the mucus was inoculated remained clear. Upon further investigation, Fleming discovered the presence of a substance in the mucus which inhibited bacterial growth. He named it lysozyme and soon discovered its presence could be found in tears, saliva, skin, hair, and fingernails. Soon, he was able to isolate large amounts of lysozyme from egg whites, but in subsequent experiments, he found that this enzyme was effective against only a small number of non-harmful bacteria. Nevertheless, these findings would lay the groundwork for Fleming’s next great discovery.\n\n(5). In 1928, Fleming began a series of experiments involving the common staphylococcal bacteria. When an uncovered Petri dish sitting next to an open window became contaminated with mold spores, Fleming observed that bacteria in proximity to the mold colonies were dying, as evidenced by the surrounding agar gel, which was dissolving and clearing. Fleming was able to isolate the mold near the dying bacteria and identified it as a member of the Penicillium genus. He found the mold was effective against all Gram-positive pathogens (these are pathogens responsible for diseases such as scarlet fever, pneumonia, gonorrhea, meningitis, and diphtheria). Fleming discerned that it was not the mold itself but some juice it had produced that had killed the bacteria. He named the “mold juice” penicillin. Later, he would say: “When I woke up just after dawn on September 28th, 1928, I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did.”\n\n(6). Fleming’s accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marked the start of modern antibiotics. Before that, many scientists had pointed out that mold (or Penicillium sp.) inhibited bacterial growth and even cured bacterial infections in animals. However, Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating penicillin, as well as being motivated enough to promote his discovery on a larger scale. Early on, Fleming also discovered that bacterium develops antibiotic resistance whenever too little penicillin is used, or when it is used for too short of a period. Almroth Wright predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noted during experiments, and Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in the many speeches he gave around the world, though he warned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason and that if it is used, never to use too little, or to use it for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.\n\n(7). Although Fleming published his initial discovery of penicillin in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in 1929, the scientific community initially greeted his work with little enthusiasm; additionally, Fleming found it difficult to isolate the aforementioned “mold juice” in large quantities. It was not until 1940, just as Fleming was contemplating retirement, that two scientists, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain developed an interest in penicillin. In time, penicillin was able to be mass-produced for use during World War II.\n\n(8). Fleming received many awards for his achievements. In 1928, he became a Professor of Bacteriology at St. Mary’s Medical School. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1943 and elevated to the level of Emeritus Professor of Bacteriology at the University of London in 1948. A recipient of around thirty honorary degrees, he won the most prestigious award of all in 1945: The Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine. Fleming was made a Knight Bachelor by King George VI in 1944 and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Alfonso X the Wise in 1948. Additionally, Time Magazine named him one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.\n\n(9).

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should first consider the meaning of “incompetency” and “fastidious.” Incompetency means inability, and fastidious means carefulness. If we consider that “fastidious” and “incompetency” are followed by “organization rules” in the question, we can conclude that, altogether, we are looking for a section of the passage which describes Fleming as an unorganized individual. Paragraph 4 reads: “History tells us that, while infected with a cold, Fleming transferred some of his nasopharyngeal mucus onto a Petri dish. Not known for fastidious laboratory organization, Fleming placed the dish amongst the clutter on his desk and left it there, forgotten, for two weeks.” We should now consider the context of this paragraph. Since Fleming was “not known for fastidious laboratory organization” and there was “clutter on his desk,” we can conclude that organization was not his strength, and therefore this is what the author means when describing Fleming’s incompetency for fastidious organization routines. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Fleming did not adhere to lab regulations – is incorrect because the passage does not mention that Fleming was being unsafe in the lab, only that he was a “messy individual.” Option B. Fleming had a phobia of organization – is incorrect because the passage does not mention that Fleming had a fear of organization, only that he was a “messy individual.” Option D. Fleming was a skilled, deliberate organizer – is incorrect because this is the opposite of how Fleming is portrayed in the passage regarding his lab techniques. Fleming left a used Petri dish amongst the clutter on his desk for 2 weeks, which hints that Fleming was a messy individual; thus, organization was not one of his strengths. Option E. Fleming had many weaknesses, and organization was one of them – is incorrect because the organizational state of his lab does not imply that Fleming had several weaknesses; it only implies that he was unorganized.",

      "text": "(1). On August 6th, 1881, Alexander Fleming was born to Hugh Fleming and Grace Stirling Morton in Lochfield Farm, Scotland. Initially schooled in Scotland, Fleming eventually moved to London, along with his three brothers and sister. He completed his youth education at the Regent Street Polytechnic but did not enter medical school immediately after; instead, Fleming worked in a shipping office for four years. When Fleming’s uncle died, the latter willed equal shares of his estate to his siblings, nieces, and nephews, and Fleming was able to use his share to pursue a medical education. In 1906, he graduated with distinction from St. Mary’s Medical School at London University.\n\n(2). Fleming did not intend to begin a career in research. While serving as a private in the London Scottish Regiment of the Territorial Army, he became a recognized marksman. However, wishing to keep Fleming in St. Mary’s to join its rifle club, the club’s captain convinced him to pursue a career in research rather than surgery, as the latter would require him to leave St. Mary’s. The captain introduced him to Sir Almroth Wright, a keen rifle club member and a pioneer in immunology and vaccine research. Wright agreed to take Fleming under his wing, and it was with Wright’s research group that Fleming would remain throughout his entire career.\n\n(3). When World War I broke out, Fleming served in the Army Medical Corps as a captain. During this time, he observed the death of many of his fellow soldiers, not always from wounds inflicted in battle but from the ensuing and uncontrollable infection resulting from these wounds. The primary means to combat an infection was antiseptics, which frequently did more harm than good; in an article, he wrote during his time in the Army Medical Corps, Fleming discussed the presence of anaerobic bacteria in deep wounds, which proliferated despite the use of antiseptics. Initially, Fleming’s research was not accepted, but Fleming continued undaunted, and in 1922 he discovered lysozyme, an enzyme with weak antibacterial properties.\n\n(4). History tells us that, while infected with a cold, Fleming transferred some of his nasopharyngeal mucus onto a Petri dish. Not known for fastidious laboratory organization, Fleming placed the dish amongst the clutter on his desk and left it there, forgotten, for two weeks. During that time, numerous colonies of bacteria grew and proliferated; however, the area where the mucus was inoculated remained clear. Upon further investigation, Fleming discovered the presence of a substance in the mucus which inhibited bacterial growth. He named it lysozyme and soon discovered its presence could be found in tears, saliva, skin, hair, and fingernails. Soon, he was able to isolate large amounts of lysozyme from egg whites, but in subsequent experiments, he found that this enzyme was effective against only a small number of non-harmful bacteria. Nevertheless, these findings would lay the groundwork for Fleming’s next great discovery.\n\n(5). In 1928, Fleming began a series of experiments involving the common staphylococcal bacteria. When an uncovered Petri dish sitting next to an open window became contaminated with mold spores, Fleming observed that bacteria in proximity to the mold colonies were dying, as evidenced by the surrounding agar gel, which was dissolving and clearing. Fleming was able to isolate the mold near the dying bacteria and identified it as a member of the Penicillium genus. He found the mold was effective against all Gram-positive pathogens (these are pathogens responsible for diseases such as scarlet fever, pneumonia, gonorrhea, meningitis, and diphtheria). Fleming discerned that it was not the mold itself but some juice it had produced that had killed the bacteria. He named the “mold juice” penicillin. Later, he would say: “When I woke up just after dawn on September 28th, 1928, I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did.”\n\n(6). Fleming’s accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marked the start of modern antibiotics. Before that, many scientists had pointed out that mold (or Penicillium sp.) inhibited bacterial growth and even cured bacterial infections in animals. However, Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating penicillin, as well as being motivated enough to promote his discovery on a larger scale. Early on, Fleming also discovered that bacterium develops antibiotic resistance whenever too little penicillin is used, or when it is used for too short of a period. Almroth Wright predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noted during experiments, and Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in the many speeches he gave around the world, though he warned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason and that if it is used, never to use too little, or to use it for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.\n\n(7). Although Fleming published his initial discovery of penicillin in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in 1929, the scientific community initially greeted his work with little enthusiasm; additionally, Fleming found it difficult to isolate the aforementioned “mold juice” in large quantities. It was not until 1940, just as Fleming was contemplating retirement, that two scientists, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain developed an interest in penicillin. In time, penicillin was able to be mass-produced for use during World War II.\n\n(8). Fleming received many awards for his achievements. In 1928, he became a Professor of Bacteriology at St. Mary’s Medical School. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1943 and elevated to the level of Emeritus Professor of Bacteriology at the University of London in 1948. A recipient of around thirty honorary degrees, he won the most prestigious award of all in 1945: The Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine. Fleming was made a Knight Bachelor by King George VI in 1944 and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Alfonso X the Wise in 1948. Additionally, Time Magazine named him one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.\n\n(9). Fleming was a quiet, patient, and modest gentleman who was not given to displays of emotion and had a natural shyness that made him avoid accolades and attention. He could be silent to the point of being inscrutable, making it difficult for even his wife and closest friends to gauge his moods and desires. Fleming was occasionally brusque and aloof, yet charming and gentle among friends and loved ones. In 1915, he married an Irish-born nurse named Sarah Marion McElroy, who went by the nickname of Sareen; after nine years of marriage, they had a son named Robert Fleming, who became a general practitioner. Sareen died after 34 years of marriage; her death affected Fleming profoundly. Subsequently, he buried himself in his work, spending long hours behind the closed doors of his laboratory. A biographer wrote: “As if overnight, Fleming, with red-rimmed eyes and trembling hands, seemed to have become an old man.” Nonetheless, in 1953 Fleming remarried Dr. Amalia Koutsouri-Vourekas, the wedding taking place in a Greek church in London.\n\n(10). On March 11, 1955, Alexander Fleming suddenly died of coronary thrombosis at home. He had been suffering from what he perceived to be gastric upset for some weeks, but when his wife called the family physician regarding Fleming’s onset of nausea on March 11, the doctor reassured them that a house visit was not necessary. However, within minutes Fleming succumbed to the coronary thrombosis. His cremated ashes were placed in St. Paul’s Cathedral, and “[h]e died as he wished; quietly, without a gradual decline in physical or mental capacity, and even without inconveniencing his physician.”\n\n(11). Prior to the introduction of penicillin and, thus, effective antibiotics, there existed no functional cure for many life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. Furthermore, when individuals sought treatment for blood infections borne from cuts, doctors possessed little ability to aid these individuals in healing, meaning that such infections were much more likely to end in fatality. During this time, giving birth also carried a much higher risk, with streptococcus pyogenes causing 50 percent of postpartum deaths in new mothers. Illnesses that are considered low-risk and relatively common in today’s world were much graver before the dawn of effective antimicrobials, surgeries carried enormous risk, and life expectancy was lower, given that diseases such as smallpox, typhus, and diphtheria—to name but a few—were largely incurable and ran unchecked throughout society. Additionally, tools that we rely on to cure illnesses in the modern world, such as chemotherapy, would be out of the question without the presence of antibiotics.\n\n(12). Fleming’s discovery of penicillin changed the world of modern medicine by ushering in the age of impactful antibiotics. The introduction of penicillin marked the beginning of the so-called golden era of antibiotics - between 1940 and 1962, most of the antibiotic classes we use as medicines today were discovered and introduced to the market. Each class typically contains several antibiotics that have been discovered over time or are modified versions of previous types. There are, for example, numerous β-lactams (pronounced beta-lactams), including different types of penicillin and cephalosporins. Today, there are very few novel antibiotics under development, but at the same time, r antibiotic-resistant bacteria are becoming more and more prevalent, thus making currently available antibiotics ineffective. As a result, we are facing a major and inevitable health problem. Nonetheless, penicillin has, and still is, saving millions of lives around the world.\n\n(13). When the microorganisms that cause disease develop defenses against the agents that are harmful to them, this is known as antimicrobial resistance. The germs that cause many common illnesses have the capacity to adapt and thus withstand the effects of antibiotics. When these viruses adapt in such a way, they create a new variation of themselves, which spreads and can become fully resistant to antibiotic treatment. This is a growing problem that causes millions of deaths per year. The virus that causes tuberculosis is evidence of this, with antimicrobial forms of the pathogen becoming more commonplace. If such drug-resistant viruses continue to proliferate and no effective solution is put in place, the spread of lethal pathogens could be a serious and very real issue that medical professionals and society at large will have to contend with. However, there are ways to slow the spread of antimicrobial-resistant viruses, including the correct disposal of antibiotics, the proper prescribing of these drugs by medical professionals, and exercising caution when self-medicating with such drugs."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should scan the passage for a paragraph that mentions the challenges Fleming encountered while in the process of conducting his research. We can presume that the paragraph containing this information will fall somewhere in the middle of the passage, as, to encounter problems with his research, Fleming would already have to be in the process of conducting it, but such problems would presumably be solved by the time Fleming’s research had been completed. Paragraph 7 reads: “Although Fleming published his initial discovery of penicillin in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in 1929, the scientific community initially greeted his work with little enthusiasm; additionally, Fleming found it difficult to isolate the aforementioned “mold juice” in large quantities.” This tells us that one difficulty Fleming encountered was producing significant amounts of “mold juice” or penicillin. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Little interest in his research on the part of his fellow scientists – is incorrect because the passage says there was “little initial enthusiasm” for Fleming’s work. This indicates that interest in Fleming’s research increased over time. Additionally, the reception of his research would not hinder his discoveries in any way, only difficulties in isolation/lab work. Option C. Bacterial resistance to penicillin – is incorrect because, while this is certainly an issue regarding penicillin, this was not a barrier to Fleming’s research; it was more of an issue that Almroth Wright predicted, and Fleming noticed with the dosage of penicillin. Option D. Difficulty finding funding for his research – is incorrect because funding for Fleming’s research is not mentioned in the passage. The only time resources, in general, are hinted at is in paragraph 2, where it is written that Fleming stayed at St Mary and was provided a research platform. Option E. Consistent results for inhibiting bacterial growth – is incorrect because, in paragraph 4, the author states: “Soon, he was able to isolate large amounts of lysozyme from egg whites, but in subsequent experiments, he found that this enzyme was effective against only a small number of non-harmful bacteria.” This implies that Fleming was able to get consistent results for inhibiting bacterial growth.",

      "title": "Passage 1",
      "text": "(1). On August 6th, 1881, Alexander Fleming was born to Hugh Fleming and Grace Stirling Morton in Lochfield Farm, Scotland. Initially schooled in Scotland, Fleming eventually moved to London, along with his three brothers and sister. He completed his youth education at the Regent Street Polytechnic but did not enter medical school immediately after; instead, Fleming worked in a shipping office for four years. When Fleming’s uncle died, the latter willed equal shares of his estate to his siblings, nieces, and nephews, and Fleming was able to use his share to pursue a medical education. In 1906, he graduated with distinction from St. Mary’s Medical School at London University.\n\n(2). Fleming did not intend to begin a career in research. While serving as a private in the London Scottish Regiment of the Territorial Army, he became a recognized marksman. However, wishing to keep Fleming in St. Mary’s to join its rifle club, the club’s captain convinced him to pursue a career in research rather than surgery, as the latter would require him to leave St. Mary’s. The captain introduced him to Sir Almroth Wright, a keen rifle club member and a pioneer in immunology and vaccine research. Wright agreed to take Fleming under his wing, and it was with Wright’s research group that Fleming would remain throughout his entire career.\n\n(3). When World War I broke out, Fleming served in the Army Medical Corps as a captain. During this time, he observed the death of many of his fellow soldiers, not always from wounds inflicted in battle but from the ensuing and uncontrollable infection resulting from these wounds. The primary means to combat an infection was antiseptics, which frequently did more harm than good; in an article, he wrote during his time in the Army Medical Corps, Fleming discussed the presence of anaerobic bacteria in deep wounds, which proliferated despite the use of antiseptics. Initially, Fleming’s research was not accepted, but Fleming continued undaunted, and in 1922 he discovered lysozyme, an enzyme with weak antibacterial properties.\n\n(4). History tells us that, while infected with a cold, Fleming transferred some of his nasopharyngeal mucus onto a Petri dish. Not known for fastidious laboratory organization, Fleming placed the dish amongst the clutter on his desk and left it there, forgotten, for two weeks. During that time, numerous colonies of bacteria grew and proliferated; however, the area where the mucus was inoculated remained clear. Upon further investigation, Fleming discovered the presence of a substance in the mucus which inhibited bacterial growth. He named it lysozyme and soon discovered its presence could be found in tears, saliva, skin, hair, and fingernails. Soon, he was able to isolate large amounts of lysozyme from egg whites, but in subsequent experiments, he found that this enzyme was effective against only a small number of non-harmful bacteria. Nevertheless, these findings would lay the groundwork for Fleming’s next great discovery.\n\n(5). In 1928, Fleming began a series of experiments involving the common staphylococcal bacteria. When an uncovered Petri dish sitting next to an open window became contaminated with mold spores, Fleming observed that bacteria in proximity to the mold colonies were dying, as evidenced by the surrounding agar gel, which was dissolving and clearing. Fleming was able to isolate the mold near the dying bacteria and identified it as a member of the Penicillium genus. He found the mold was effective against all Gram-positive pathogens (these are pathogens responsible for diseases such as scarlet fever, pneumonia, gonorrhea, meningitis, and diphtheria). Fleming discerned that it was not the mold itself but some juice it had produced that had killed the bacteria. He named the “mold juice” penicillin. Later, he would say: “When I woke up just after dawn on September 28th, 1928, I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did.”\n\n(6). Fleming’s accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marked the start of modern antibiotics. Before that, many scientists had pointed out that mold (or Penicillium sp.) inhibited bacterial growth and even cured bacterial infections in animals. However, Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating penicillin, as well as being motivated enough to promote his discovery on a larger scale. Early on, Fleming also discovered that bacterium develops antibiotic resistance whenever too little penicillin is used, or when it is used for too short of a period. Almroth Wright predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noted during experiments, and Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in the many speeches he gave around the world, though he warned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason and that if it is used, never to use too little, or to use it for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.\n\n(7). Although Fleming published his initial discovery of penicillin in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in 1929, the scientific community initially greeted his work with little enthusiasm; additionally, Fleming found it difficult to isolate the aforementioned “mold juice” in large quantities. It was not until 1940, just as Fleming was contemplating retirement, that two scientists, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain developed an interest in penicillin. In time, penicillin was able to be mass-produced for use during World War II.\n\n(8). Fleming received many awards for his achievements. In 1928, he became a Professor of Bacteriology at St. Mary’s Medical School. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1943 and elevated to the level of Emeritus Professor of Bacteriology at the University of London in 1948. A recipient of around thirty honorary degrees, he won the most prestigious award of all in 1945: The Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine. Fleming was made a Knight Bachelor by King George VI in 1944 and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Alfonso X the Wise in 1948. Additionally, Time Magazine named him one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.\n\n(9). Fleming was a quiet, patient, and modest gentleman who was not given to displays of emotion and had a natural shyness that made him avoid accolades and attention. He could be silent to the point of being inscrutable, making it difficult for even his wife and closest friends to gauge his moods and desires. Fleming was occasionally brusque and aloof, yet charming and gentle among friends and loved ones. In 1915, he married an Irish-born nurse named Sarah Marion McElroy, who went by the nickname of Sareen; after nine years of marriage, they had a son named Robert Fleming, who became a general practitioner. Sareen died after 34 years of marriage; her death affected Fleming profoundly. Subsequently, he buried himself in his work, spending long hours behind the closed doors of his laboratory. A biographer wrote: “As if overnight, Fleming, with red-rimmed eyes and trembling hands, seemed to have become an old man.” Nonetheless, in 1953 Fleming remarried Dr. Amalia Koutsouri-Vourekas, the wedding taking place in a Greek church in London.\n\n(10). On March 11, 1955, Alexander Fleming suddenly died of coronary thrombosis at home. He had been suffering from what he perceived to be gastric upset for some weeks, but when his wife called the family physician regarding Fleming’s onset of nausea on March 11, the doctor reassured them that a house visit was not necessary. However, within minutes Fleming succumbed to the coronary thrombosis. His cremated ashes were placed in St. Paul’s Cathedral, and “[h]e died as he wished; quietly, without a gradual decline in physical or mental capacity, and even without inconveniencing his physician.”\n\n(11). Prior to the introduction of penicillin and, thus, effective antibiotics, there existed no functional cure for many life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. Furthermore, when individuals sought treatment for blood infections borne from cuts, doctors possessed little ability to aid these individuals in healing, meaning that such infections were much more likely to end in fatality. During this time, giving birth also carried a much higher risk, with streptococcus pyogenes causing 50 percent of postpartum deaths in new mothers. Illnesses that are considered low-risk and relatively common in today’s world were much graver before the dawn of effective antimicrobials, surgeries carried enormous risk, and life expectancy was lower, given that diseases such as smallpox, typhus, and diphtheria—to name but a few—were largely incurable and ran unchecked throughout society. Additionally, tools that we rely on to cure illnesses in the modern world, such as chemotherapy, would be out of the question without the presence of antibiotics.\n\n(12). Fleming’s discovery of penicillin changed the world of modern medicine by ushering in the age of impactful antibiotics. The introduction of penicillin marked the beginning of the so-called golden era of antibiotics - between 1940 and 1962, most of the antibiotic classes we use as medicines today were discovered and introduced to the market. Each class typically contains several antibiotics that have been discovered over time or are modified versions of previous types. There are, for example, numerous β-lactams (pronounced beta-lactams), including different types of penicillin and cephalosporins. Today, there are very few novel antibiotics under development, but at the same time, r antibiotic-resistant bacteria are becoming more and more prevalent, thus making currently available antibiotics ineffective. As a result, we are facing a major and inevitable health problem. Nonetheless, penicillin has, and still is, saving millions of lives around the world.\n\n(13). When the microorganisms that cause disease develop defenses against the agents that are harmful to them, this is known as antimicrobial resistance. The germs that cause many common illnesses have the capacity to adapt and thus withstand the effects of antibiotics. When these viruses adapt in such a way, they create a new variation of themselves, which spreads and can become fully resistant to antibiotic treatment. This is a growing problem that causes millions of deaths per year. The virus that causes tuberculosis is evidence of this, with antimicrobial forms of the pathogen becoming more commonplace. If such drug-resistant viruses continue to proliferate and no effective solution is put in place, the spread of lethal pathogens could be a serious and very real issue that medical professionals and society at large will have to contend with. However, there are ways to slow the spread of antimicrobial-resistant viruses, including the correct disposal of antibiotics, the proper prescribing of these drugs by medical professionals, and exercising caution when self-medicating with such drugs."

While serving as a private in the London Scottish Regiment of the Territorial Army, he became a recognized marksman. However, wishing to keep Fleming in St. Mary’s to join its rifle club, the club’s captain convinced him to pursue a career in research rather than surgery, as the latter would require him to leave St. Mary’s. The captain introduced him to Sir Almroth Wright, a keen rifle club member and a pioneer in immunology and vaccine research. Wright agreed to take Fleming under his wing, and it was with Wright’s research group that Fleming would remain throughout his entire career.\n\n(3). When World War I broke out, Fleming served in the Army Medical Corps as a captain. During this time, he observed the death of many of his fellow soldiers, not always from wounds inflicted in battle but from the ensuing and uncontrollable infection resulting from these wounds. The primary means to combat an infection was antiseptics, which frequently did more harm than good; in an article, he wrote during his time in the Army Medical Corps, Fleming discussed the presence of anaerobic bacteria in deep wounds, which proliferated despite the use of antiseptics. Initially, Fleming’s research was not accepted, but Fleming continued undaunted, and in 1922 he discovered lysozyme, an enzyme with weak antibacterial properties.\n\n(4). History tells us that, while infected with a cold, Fleming transferred some of his nasopharyngeal mucus onto a Petri dish. Not known for fastidious laboratory organization, Fleming placed the dish amongst the clutter on his desk and left it there, forgotten, for two weeks. During that time, numerous colonies of bacteria grew and proliferated; however, the area where the mucus was inoculated remained clear. Upon further investigation, Fleming discovered the presence of a substance in the mucus which inhibited bacterial growth. He named it lysozyme and soon discovered its presence could be found in tears, saliva, skin, hair, and fingernails. Soon, he was able to isolate large amounts of lysozyme from egg whites, but in subsequent experiments, he found that this enzyme was effective against only a small number of non-harmful bacteria. Nevertheless, these findings would lay the groundwork for Fleming’s next great discovery.\n\n(5). In 1928, Fleming began a series of experiments involving the common staphylococcal bacteria. When an uncovered Petri dish sitting next to an open window became contaminated with mold spores, Fleming observed that bacteria in proximity to the mold colonies were dying, as evidenced by the surrounding agar gel, which was dissolving and clearing. Fleming was able to isolate the mold near the dying bacteria and identified it as a member of the Penicillium genus. He found the mold was effective against all Gram-positive pathogens (these are pathogens responsible for diseases such as scarlet fever, pneumonia, gonorrhea, meningitis, and diphtheria). Fleming discerned that it was not the mold itself but some juice it had produced that had killed the bacteria. He named the “mold juice” penicillin. Later, he would say: “When I woke up just after dawn on September 28th, 1928, I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did.”\n\n(6). Fleming’s accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marked the start of modern antibiotics. Before that, many scientists had pointed out that mold (or Penicillium sp.) inhibited bacterial growth and even cured bacterial infections in animals. However, Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating penicillin, as well as being motivated enough to promote his discovery on a larger scale. Early on, Fleming also discovered that bacterium develops antibiotic resistance whenever too little penicillin is used, or when it is used for too short of a period. Almroth Wright predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noted during experiments, and Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in the many speeches he gave around the world, though he warned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason and that if it is used, never to use too little, or to use it for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.\n\n(7). Although Fleming published his initial discovery of penicillin in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in 1929, the scientific community initially greeted his work with little enthusiasm; additionally, Fleming found it difficult to isolate the aforementioned “mold juice” in large quantities. It was not until 1940, just as Fleming was contemplating retirement, that two scientists, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain developed an interest in penicillin. In time, penicillin was able to be mass-produced for use during World War II.\n\n(8). Fleming received many awards for his achievements. In 1928, he became a Professor of Bacteriology at St. Mary’s Medical School. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1943 and elevated to the level of Emeritus Professor of Bacteriology at the University of London in 1948. A recipient of around thirty honorary degrees, he won the most prestigious award of all in 1945: The Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine. Fleming was made a Knight Bachelor by King George VI in 1944 and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Alfonso X the Wise in 1948. Additionally, Time Magazine named him one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.\n\n(9). Fleming was a quiet, patient, and modest gentleman who was not given to displays of emotion and had a natural shyness that made him avoid accolades and attention. He could be silent to the point of being inscrutable, making it difficult for even his wife and closest friends to gauge his moods and desires. Fleming was occasionally brusque and aloof, yet charming and gentle among friends and loved ones. In 1915, he married an Irish-born nurse named Sarah Marion McElroy, who went by the nickname of Sareen; after nine years of marriage, they had a son named Robert Fleming, who became a general practitioner. Sareen died after 34 years of marriage; her death affected Fleming profoundly. Subsequently, he buried himself in his work, spending long hours behind the closed doors of his laboratory. A biographer wrote: “As if overnight, Fleming, with red-rimmed eyes and trembling hands, seemed to have become an old man.” Nonetheless, in 1953 Fleming remarried Dr. Amalia Koutsouri-Vourekas, the wedding taking place in a Greek church in London.\n\n(10). On March 11, 1955, Alexander Fleming suddenly died of coronary thrombosis at home. He had been suffering from what he perceived to be gastric upset for some weeks, but when his wife called the family physician regarding Fleming’s onset of nausea on March 11, the doctor reassured them that a house visit was not necessary. However, within minutes Fleming succumbed to the coronary thrombosis. His cremated ashes were placed in St. Paul’s Cathedral, and “[h]e died as he wished; quietly, without a gradual decline in physical or mental capacity, and even without inconveniencing his physician.”\n\n(11). Prior to the introduction of penicillin and, thus, effective antibiotics, there existed no functional cure for many life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. Furthermore, when individuals sought treatment for blood infections borne from cuts, doctors possessed little ability to aid these individuals in healing, meaning that such infections were much more likely to end in fatality. During this time, giving birth also carried a much higher risk, with streptococcus pyogenes causing 50 percent of postpartum deaths in new mothers. Illnesses that are considered low-risk and relatively common in today’s world were much graver before the dawn of effective antimicrobials, surgeries carried enormous risk, and life expectancy was lower, given that diseases such as smallpox, typhus, and diphtheria—to name but a few—were largely incurable and ran unchecked throughout society. Additionally, tools that we rely on to cure illnesses in the modern world, such as chemotherapy, would be out of the question without the presence of antibiotics.\n\n(12). Fleming’s discovery of penicillin changed the world of modern medicine by ushering in the age of impactful antibiotics. The introduction of penicillin marked the beginning of the so-called golden era of antibiotics - between 1940 and 1962, most of the antibiotic classes we use as medicines today were discovered and introduced to the market. Each class typically contains several antibiotics that have been discovered over time or are modified versions of previous types. There are, for example, numerous β-lactams (pronounced beta-lactams), including different types of penicillin and cephalosporins. Today, there are very few novel antibiotics under development, but at the same time, r antibiotic-resistant bacteria are becoming more and more prevalent, thus making currently available antibiotics ineffective. As a result, we are facing a major and inevitable health problem. Nonetheless, penicillin has, and still is, saving millions of lives around the world.\n\n(13). When the microorganisms that cause disease develop defenses against the agents that are harmful to them, this is known as antimicrobial resistance. The germs that cause many common illnesses have the capacity to adapt and thus withstand the effects of antibiotics. When these viruses adapt in such a way, they create a new variation of themselves, which spreads and can become fully resistant to antibiotic treatment. This is a growing problem that causes millions of deaths per year. The virus that causes tuberculosis is evidence of this, with antimicrobial forms of the pathogen becoming more commonplace. If such drug-resistant viruses continue to proliferate and no effective solution is put in place, the spread of lethal pathogens could be a serious and very real issue that medical professionals and society at large will have to contend with. However, there are ways to slow the spread of antimicrobial-resistant viruses, including the correct disposal of antibiotics, the proper prescribing of these drugs by medical professionals, and exercising caution when self-medicating with such drugs."

Fleming discerned that it was not the mold itself but some juice it had produced that had killed the bacteria. He named the “mold juice” penicillin. Later, he would say: “When I woke up just after dawn on September 28th, 1928, I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did.”\n\n(6). Fleming’s accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marked the start of modern antibiotics. Before that, many scientists had pointed out that mold (or Penicillium sp.) inhibited bacterial growth and even cured bacterial infections in animals. However, Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating penicillin, as well as being motivated enough to promote his discovery on a larger scale. Early on, Fleming also discovered that bacterium develops antibiotic resistance whenever too little penicillin is used, or when it is used for too short of a period. Almroth Wright predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noted during experiments, and Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in the many speeches he gave around the world, though he warned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason and that if it is used, never to use too little, or to use it for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.\n\n(7). Although Fleming published his initial discovery of penicillin in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in 1929, the scientific community initially greeted his work with little enthusiasm; additionally, Fleming found it difficult to isolate the aforementioned “mold juice” in large quantities. It was not until 1940, just as Fleming was contemplating retirement, that two scientists, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain developed an interest in penicillin. In time, penicillin was able to be mass-produced for use during World War II.\n\n(8). Fleming received many awards for his achievements. In 1928, he became a Professor of Bacteriology at St. Mary’s Medical School. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1943 and elevated to the level of Emeritus Professor of Bacteriology at the University of London in 1948. A recipient of around thirty honorary degrees, he won the most prestigious award of all in 1945: The Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine. Fleming was made a Knight Bachelor by King George VI in 1944 and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Alfonso X the Wise in 1948. Additionally, Time Magazine named him one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.\n\n(9). Fleming was a quiet, patient, and modest gentleman who was not given to displays of emotion and had a natural shyness that made him avoid accolades and attention. He could be silent to the point of being inscrutable, making it difficult for even his wife and closest friends to gauge his moods and desires. Fleming was occasionally brusque and aloof, yet charming and gentle among friends and loved ones. In 1915, he married an Irish-born nurse named Sarah Marion McElroy, who went by the nickname of Sareen; after nine years of marriage, they had a son named Robert Fleming, who became a general practitioner. Sareen died after 34 years of marriage; her death affected Fleming profoundly. Subsequently, he buried himself in his work, spending long hours behind the closed doors of his laboratory. A biographer wrote: “As if overnight, Fleming, with red-rimmed eyes and trembling hands, seemed to have become an old man.” Nonetheless, in 1953 Fleming remarried Dr. Amalia Koutsouri-Vourekas, the wedding taking place in a Greek church in London.\n\n(10). On March 11, 1955, Alexander Fleming suddenly died of coronary thrombosis at home. He had been suffering from what he perceived to be gastric upset for some weeks, but when his wife called the family physician regarding Fleming’s onset of nausea on March 11, the doctor reassured them that a house visit was not necessary. However, within minutes Fleming succumbed to the coronary thrombosis. His cremated ashes were placed in St. Paul’s Cathedral, and “[h]e died as he wished; quietly, without a gradual decline in physical or mental capacity, and even without inconveniencing his physician.”\n\n(11). Prior to the introduction of penicillin and, thus, effective antibiotics, there existed no functional cure for many life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. Furthermore, when individuals sought treatment for blood infections borne from cuts, doctors possessed little ability to aid these individuals in healing, meaning that such infections were much more likely to end in fatality. During this time, giving birth also carried a much higher risk, with streptococcus pyogenes causing 50 percent of postpartum deaths in new mothers. Illnesses that are considered low-risk and relatively common in today’s world were much graver before the dawn of effective antimicrobials, surgeries carried enormous risk, and life expectancy was lower, given that diseases such as smallpox, typhus, and diphtheria—to name but a few—were largely incurable and ran unchecked throughout society. Additionally, tools that we rely on to cure illnesses in the modern world, such as chemotherapy, would be out of the question without the presence of antibiotics.\n\n(12). Fleming’s discovery of penicillin changed the world of modern medicine by ushering in the age of impactful antibiotics. The introduction of penicillin marked the beginning of the so-called golden era of antibiotics - between 1940 and 1962, most of the antibiotic classes we use as medicines today were discovered and introduced to the market. Each class typically contains several antibiotics that have been discovered over time or are modified versions of previous types. There are, for example, numerous β-lactams (pronounced beta-lactams), including different types of penicillin and cephalosporins. Today, there are very few novel antibiotics under development, but at the same time, r antibiotic-resistant bacteria are becoming more and more prevalent, thus making currently available antibiotics ineffective. As a result, we are facing a major and inevitable health problem. Nonetheless, penicillin has, and still is, saving millions of lives around the world.\n\n(13). When the microorganisms that cause disease develop defenses against the agents that are harmful to them, this is known as antimicrobial resistance. The germs that cause many common illnesses have the capacity to adapt and thus withstand the effects of antibiotics. When these viruses adapt in such a way, they create a new variation of themselves, which spreads and can become fully resistant to antibiotic treatment. This is a growing problem that causes millions of deaths per year. The virus that causes tuberculosis is evidence of this, with antimicrobial forms of the pathogen becoming more commonplace. If such drug-resistant viruses continue to proliferate and no effective solution is put in place, the spread of lethal pathogens could be a serious and very real issue that medical professionals and society at large will have to contend with. However, there are ways to slow the spread of antimicrobial-resistant viruses, including the correct disposal of antibiotics, the proper prescribing of these drugs by medical professionals, and exercising caution when self-medicating with such drugs."

Paragraph 9 states: “ Fleming was a quiet, patient, and modest gentleman who was not given to displays of emotion and had a natural shyness that made him avoid accolades and attention. He could be silent to the point of being inscrutable, making it difficult for even his wife and closest friends to gauge his moods and desires.” This tells us that Fleming was a quiet and secretive man who was almost impossible to read. The author indicates that he was difficult to understand, which is synonymous with being unfathomable and inscrutable . Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",

A person cannot be “hazy,” which means to be blurry or unclear. Option C. Introverted – is incorrect because while introversion was said to be a characteristic of Fleming’s, it is not a good replacement for the word inscrutable, which means difficult to understand. Option D. Mean – is incorrect because mean and inscrutable are not synonyms. Mean is defined as being unkind or unfair, while inscrutable, in the context of the paragraph, means difficult to understand. Option E.

      "title": "Passage 1",
      "text": "(1). On August 6th, 1881, Alexander Fleming was born to Hugh Fleming and Grace Stirling Morton in Lochfield Farm, Scotland. Initially schooled in Scotland, Fleming eventually moved to London, along with his three brothers and sister. He completed his youth education at the Regent Street Polytechnic but did not enter medical school immediately after; instead, Fleming worked in a shipping office for four years. When Fleming’s uncle died, the latter willed equal shares of his estate to his siblings, nieces, and nephews, and Fleming was able to use his share to pursue a medical education. In 1906, he graduated with distinction from St. Mary’s Medical School at London University.\n\n(2). Fleming did not intend to begin a career in research. While serving as a private in the London Scottish Regiment of the Territorial Army, he became a recognized marksman. However, wishing to keep Fleming in St. Mary’s to join its rifle club, the club’s captain convinced him to pursue a career in research rather than surgery, as the latter would require him to leave St. Mary’s. The captain introduced him to Sir Almroth Wright, a keen rifle club member and a pioneer in immunology and vaccine research. Wright agreed to take Fleming under his wing, and it was with Wright’s research group that Fleming would remain throughout his entire career.\n\n(3). When World War I broke out, Fleming served in the Army Medical Corps as a captain. During this time, he observed the death of many of his fellow soldiers, not always from wounds inflicted in battle but from the ensuing and uncontrollable infection resulting from these wounds. The primary means to combat an infection was antiseptics, which frequently did more harm than good; in an article, he wrote during his time in the Army Medical Corps, Fleming discussed the presence of anaerobic bacteria in deep wounds, which proliferated despite the use of antiseptics. Initially, Fleming’s research was not accepted, but Fleming continued undaunted, and in 1922 he discovered lysozyme, an enzyme with weak antibacterial properties.\n\n(4). History tells us that, while infected with a cold, Fleming transferred some of his nasopharyngeal mucus onto a Petri dish. Not known for fastidious laboratory organization, Fleming placed the dish amongst the clutter on his desk and left it there, forgotten, for two weeks. During that time, numerous colonies of bacteria grew and proliferated; however, the area where the mucus was inoculated remained clear. Upon further investigation, Fleming discovered the presence of a substance in the mucus which inhibited bacterial growth. He named it lysozyme and soon discovered its presence could be found in tears, saliva, skin, hair, and fingernails. Soon, he was able to isolate large amounts of lysozyme from egg whites, but in subsequent experiments, he found that this enzyme was effective against only a small number of non-harmful bacteria. Nevertheless, these findings would lay the groundwork for Fleming’s next great discovery.\n\n(5). In 1928, Fleming began a series of experiments involving the common staphylococcal bacteria. When an uncovered Petri dish sitting next to an open window became contaminated with mold spores, Fleming observed that bacteria in proximity to the mold colonies were dying, as evidenced by the surrounding agar gel, which was dissolving and clearing. Fleming was able to isolate the mold near the dying bacteria and identified it as a member of the Penicillium genus. He found the mold was effective against all Gram-positive pathogens (these are pathogens responsible for diseases such as scarlet fever, pneumonia, gonorrhea, meningitis, and diphtheria). Fleming discerned that it was not the mold itself but some juice it had produced that had killed the bacteria. He named the “mold juice” penicillin.

      "title": "Passage 2",
      "text": "(1). What if I told you one of the earliest remedies for pain was eating tree bark? 4000 years ago, the Sumerians, a primordial civilization in the historical region of Mesopotamia discovered that eating the bark of a white willow tree relieved their ailments. How they came upon this discovery is unbeknownst, but if I were to guess, it was because someone was in such hysterical pain that they resorted to chewing through a tree to alleviate it. A couple of thousand years later in 400 BC, Hippocrates, best known for his ingenious medical prescience, prescribed willow-leaf tea to pregnant ladies on the verge of childbirth. Following the footsteps of Hippocrates, a reverend in Oxford named Edward Stone ingested willow bark which eased his suffering from an undisclosed pain. His interest gained momentum as he conducted self-experiments; he first dried the willow bark in a bag outside of a baker’s oven for three months and then pulverized it into a powder that he would use to carefully dose himself. He found that not long after, his pain was entirely eradicated. Over the course of several years, Stone extended his experiments to others and found that these salubrious effects persisted. It was then that he sent a letter to the Dutch of Oxford announcing his discovery of salicylate, the precursor to aspirin. (2). It was not until the 19th century that the chemical composition of this natural analgesic became a subject of international investigation. Two scientists isolated the active ingredient - salicin, using separate methods. Henry Leroux isolated salicin from willow bark in 1826, while two years later, Johann Buchner extracted salicin from meadowsweet - another known plant with robust painkilling qualities. Decades later in 1899, the German chemist Felix Hoffman procured pure, stable acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. (3). The story behind Hoffman’s discovery of aspirin is mired in controversy. It is often stated that Hoffman’s rheumatic father prompted the search for a cure. Another scientist, however, named Arthur Eichengrün, was the man who instructed Hoffman to synthesize acetylsalicylic acid to create a safer version of sodium salicylate. The larger purpose of the experiment was unknown to Hoffman, as Eichengrün claimed in a letter. The clinical trials of aspirin began when Eichengrün dosed himself. He soon proceeded to the public once physicians validated the safety of this drug. Regardless of how it came to be, the discovery of acetylsalicylic acid highlighted a revolutionary point in the pharmaceutical industry. (4). Widely regarded as the birthmark of the drug business, aspirin quickly took off. It was named after its active compound acetylsalicylic acid and spirea alba (meadowsweet). Today, 100 billion aspirin tablets are consumed daily to treat a myriad of problems, such as those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or pericarditis. Moreover, aspirin is readily prescribed to promote healthy blood flow in those at risk of stroke and heart attack. (5). Aspirin is a non-steroid, anti-inflammatory drug that primarily modulates blood clotting. It alters the platelet activation pathway through two unique, inhibitory binding sequences. Let us use the example of a paper cut to illustrate the progression of this pathway. Immediately following the slicing of the skin, the pain receptors relay the signal to the brain which releases hormones such as epinephrine, thrombin, or vasopressin. (6). The pain-modulating hormones activate phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ), an enzyme that cleaves phospholipids from the cell membrane into arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is a substrate for COX, which is an integral enzyme involved in the pathways of pain, fever, clotting, and inflammation. COX turns arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which mediate two antagonistic pathways of blood vessel control. The primary pathway utilizes thromboxane synthase to turn prostaglandin into thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). TXA 2 migrates to the platelets where it leads to platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Per our example, the accumulation of TXA 2 within the platelets at the site of the wound ceases the bleeding and closes the paper cut. (7). The second pathway turns prostaglandin into prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). PGI 2 subsequently travels to the endothelium where it causes vasodilation and decreased platelet aggregation. PGI 2 analogs are typically used to combat hypertension or restricted oxygen flow to peripheral organs. To summarize, the thromboxane A 2 pathway increases platelet aggregation via platelet activation while prostacyclin reduces platelet aggregation by acting on the endothelium. (8). Aspirin prevents the actualization of the platelet aggregation pathway by inhibiting COX. The COX enzyme has two variations: COX-1 and COX-2, which are both involved in turning arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. COX-1, however, has two unique features that distinguish it from COX-2. Firstly, only COX-1 produces TXA 2 which turns on platelet aggregation; in this sense, COX-1 is a procoagulant. Next, COX-1 leads to the synthesis of specialized prostaglandins that form the protective lining of the stomach epithelium. The two COX enzymes are also structurally different. The active site of COX-2 is larger, which allows the precursor of prostaglandins, arachidonic acid, to bypass aspirin molecules at lower doses. Therefore, a higher dose of aspirin is required to achieve analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects as compared to its antiplatelet action. The various sensitivity of COX-1 and COX-2 to aspirin explains alternate dosing regimens in medicinal practice. Lower dose aspirin targets COX-1 while higher dose aspirin inhibits COX-2. (9). In clinical settings, low-dose aspirin is prescribed for those at high risk of heart attack and stroke, but low risk of bleeding. Categorization of individuals based on these premises is difficult because individual risk factors vary. Generally, people who fall into this category are between 40 and 70 years of age, display abnormally high levels of LDL cholesterol, or have a familial history of early coronary blockage. Similarly, those with a previous history of heart attack or stroke are also prescribed low-dose aspirin to prevent a subsequent episode. For these people, aspirin is a lifesaver; it ensures a consistent blood supply to the vital organs of the body by preventing platelet aggregation and clotting. (10). On the other hand, there are certain cases where the prescription of aspirin can be life-threatening. A series of recent studies revealed that as people age beyond 70, their risk of bleeding outstrips their risk of a myocardial infarction or brain stroke. A study conducted in 2018 by McNeill and colleagues investigating the effects of aspirin on cardiovascular events and bleeding in the elderly found that prescribing low-dose aspirin to healthy individuals resulted in a higher risk of major hemorrhage but did not significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate these findings because they demonstrate how individuals taking aspirin had approximately the same incidence of cardiovascular disease as the placebo group, but more cases of major hemorrhaging. Members within this age group are also characterized by being on other medications like ibuprofen or naproxen, utilizing walking assistance, having heavy alcohol usage, and having a history of falling or bleeding episodes. While aspirin may reduce the odds of a clot-related stroke, it increases the chances of a hemorrhagic stroke or stomach damage. Therefore, aspirin is not prescribed to this cohort because the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits. It is also important to note that allergies to aspirin have precluded its usage for certain individuals.\n\n\n\n(11). Despite these limitations, aspirin remains one of the most steadfast remedies for cardiovascular problems due to its affordability and potent efficacy. However, preventative interventions remain preferable. On this front, gene therapy and genetic screening have gained much momentum in the last two decades. The successor of the human genome project, ENCODE (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements), was launched in 2014 to catalog all functional genes in the human genome. Identifying the genes involved in ailments is the first step in developing editing techniques to remediate these diseases. Not to mention, advancements in embryonic stem cell research are eagerly pacing towards a future where efficiently engineering the human genome is a feasible reality. This trend is particularly evident in China where the principles of Confucian philosophy permit research on embryonic clusters that are less than 14 days old.

      "text": "(1). What if I told you one of the earliest remedies for pain was eating tree bark? 4000 years ago, the Sumerians, a primordial civilization in the historical region of Mesopotamia discovered that eating the bark of a white willow tree relieved their ailments. How they came upon this discovery is unbeknownst, but if I were to guess, it was because someone was in such hysterical pain that they resorted to chewing through a tree to alleviate it. A couple of thousand years later in 400 BC, Hippocrates, best known for his ingenious medical prescience, prescribed willow-leaf tea to pregnant ladies on the verge of childbirth. Following the footsteps of Hippocrates, a reverend in Oxford named Edward Stone ingested willow bark which eased his suffering from an undisclosed pain. His interest gained momentum as he conducted self-experiments; he first dried the willow bark in a bag outside of a baker’s oven for three months and then pulverized it into a powder that he would use to carefully dose himself. He found that not long after, his pain was entirely eradicated. Over the course of several years, Stone extended his experiments to others and found that these salubrious effects persisted. It was then that he sent a letter to the Dutch of Oxford announcing his discovery of salicylate, the precursor to aspirin. (2). It was not until the 19th century that the chemical composition of this natural analgesic became a subject of international investigation. Two scientists isolated the active ingredient - salicin, using separate methods. Henry Leroux isolated salicin from willow bark in 1826, while two years later, Johann Buchner extracted salicin from meadowsweet - another known plant with robust painkilling qualities. Decades later in 1899, the German chemist Felix Hoffman procured pure, stable acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. (3). The story behind Hoffman’s discovery of aspirin is mired in controversy. It is often stated that Hoffman’s rheumatic father prompted the search for a cure. Another scientist, however, named Arthur Eichengrün, was the man who instructed Hoffman to synthesize acetylsalicylic acid to create a safer version of sodium salicylate. The larger purpose of the experiment was unknown to Hoffman, as Eichengrün claimed in a letter. The clinical trials of aspirin began when Eichengrün dosed himself. He soon proceeded to the public once physicians validated the safety of this drug. Regardless of how it came to be, the discovery of acetylsalicylic acid highlighted a revolutionary point in the pharmaceutical industry. (4). Widely regarded as the birthmark of the drug business, aspirin quickly took off. It was named after its active compound acetylsalicylic acid and spirea alba (meadowsweet). Today, 100 billion aspirin tablets are consumed daily to treat a myriad of problems, such as those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or pericarditis. Moreover, aspirin is readily prescribed to promote healthy blood flow in those at risk of stroke and heart attack. (5). Aspirin is a non-steroid, anti-inflammatory drug that primarily modulates blood clotting. It alters the platelet activation pathway through two unique, inhibitory binding sequences. Let us use the example of a paper cut to illustrate the progression of this pathway. Immediately following the slicing of the skin, the pain receptors relay the signal to the brain which releases hormones such as epinephrine, thrombin, or vasopressin. (6). The pain-modulating hormones activate phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ), an enzyme that cleaves phospholipids from the cell membrane into arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is a substrate for COX, which is an integral enzyme involved in the pathways of pain, fever, clotting, and inflammation. COX turns arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which mediate two antagonistic pathways of blood vessel control. The primary pathway utilizes thromboxane synthase to turn prostaglandin into thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). TXA 2 migrates to the platelets where it leads to platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Per our example, the accumulation of TXA 2 within the platelets at the site of the wound ceases the bleeding and closes the paper cut. (7). The second pathway turns prostaglandin into prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). PGI 2 subsequently travels to the endothelium where it causes vasodilation and decreased platelet aggregation. PGI 2 analogs are typically used to combat hypertension or restricted oxygen flow to peripheral organs. To summarize, the thromboxane A 2 pathway increases platelet aggregation via platelet activation while prostacyclin reduces platelet aggregation by acting on the endothelium. (8). Aspirin prevents the actualization of the platelet aggregation pathway by inhibiting COX. The COX enzyme has two variations: COX-1 and COX-2, which are both involved in turning arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. COX-1, however, has two unique features that distinguish it from COX-2. Firstly, only COX-1 produces TXA 2 which turns on platelet aggregation; in this sense, COX-1 is a procoagulant. Next, COX-1 leads to the synthesis of specialized prostaglandins that form the protective lining of the stomach epithelium. The two COX enzymes are also structurally different. The active site of COX-2 is larger, which allows the precursor of prostaglandins, arachidonic acid, to bypass aspirin molecules at lower doses. Therefore, a higher dose of aspirin is required to achieve analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects as compared to its antiplatelet action. The various sensitivity of COX-1 and COX-2 to aspirin explains alternate dosing regimens in medicinal practice. Lower dose aspirin targets COX-1 while higher dose aspirin inhibits COX-2. (9). In clinical settings, low-dose aspirin is prescribed for those at high risk of heart attack and stroke, but low risk of bleeding. Categorization of individuals based on these premises is difficult because individual risk factors vary. Generally, people who fall into this category are between 40 and 70 years of age, display abnormally high levels of LDL cholesterol, or have a familial history of early coronary blockage. Similarly, those with a previous history of heart attack or stroke are also prescribed low-dose aspirin to prevent a subsequent episode. For these people, aspirin is a lifesaver; it ensures a consistent blood supply to the vital organs of the body by preventing platelet aggregation and clotting. (10). On the other hand, there are certain cases where the prescription of aspirin can be life-threatening. A series of recent studies revealed that as people age beyond 70, their risk of bleeding outstrips their risk of a myocardial infarction or brain stroke. A study conducted in 2018 by McNeill and colleagues investigating the effects of aspirin on cardiovascular events and bleeding in the elderly found that prescribing low-dose aspirin to healthy individuals resulted in a higher risk of major hemorrhage but did not significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate these findings because they demonstrate how individuals taking aspirin had approximately the same incidence of cardiovascular disease as the placebo group, but more cases of major hemorrhaging. Members within this age group are also characterized by being on other medications like ibuprofen or naproxen, utilizing walking assistance, having heavy alcohol usage, and having a history of falling or bleeding episodes. While aspirin may reduce the odds of a clot-related stroke, it increases the chances of a hemorrhagic stroke or stomach damage. Therefore, aspirin is not prescribed to this cohort because the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits. It is also important to note that allergies to aspirin have precluded its usage for certain individuals.\n\n\n\n(11). Despite these limitations, aspirin remains one of the most steadfast remedies for cardiovascular problems due to its affordability and potent efficacy. However, preventative interventions remain preferable. On this front, gene therapy and genetic screening have gained much momentum in the last two decades. The successor of the human genome project, ENCODE (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements), was launched in 2014 to catalog all functional genes in the human genome. Identifying the genes involved in ailments is the first step in developing editing techniques to remediate these diseases. Not to mention, advancements in embryonic stem cell research are eagerly pacing towards a future where efficiently engineering the human genome is a feasible reality. This trend is particularly evident in China where the principles of Confucian philosophy permit research on embryonic clusters that are less than 14 days old. Additionally, computational technology is making it easier to measure and refine the gene-editing process. Evidently, with this ability to edit our health with more precision than ever before, we are on the precipice of something exciting yet equally dangerous."

It was not until the 19th century that the chemical composition of this natural analgesic became a subject of international investigation. Two scientists isolated the active ingredient - salicin, using separate methods. Henry Leroux isolated salicin from willow bark in 1826, while two years later, Johann Buchner extracted salicin from meadowsweet - another known plant with robust painkilling qualities. Decades later in 1899, the German chemist Felix Hoffman procured pure, stable acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. (3). The story behind Hoffman’s discovery of aspirin is mired in controversy. It is often stated that Hoffman’s rheumatic father prompted the search for a cure. Another scientist, however, named Arthur Eichengrün, was the man who instructed Hoffman to synthesize acetylsalicylic acid to create a safer version of sodium salicylate. The larger purpose of the experiment was unknown to Hoffman, as Eichengrün claimed in a letter. The clinical trials of aspirin began when Eichengrün dosed himself. He soon proceeded to the public once physicians validated the safety of this drug. Regardless of how it came to be, the discovery of acetylsalicylic acid highlighted a revolutionary point in the pharmaceutical industry. (4). Widely regarded as the birthmark of the drug business, aspirin quickly took off. It was named after its active compound acetylsalicylic acid and spirea alba (meadowsweet). Today, 100 billion aspirin tablets are consumed daily to treat a myriad of problems, such as those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or pericarditis. Moreover, aspirin is readily prescribed to promote healthy blood flow in those at risk of stroke and heart attack. (5). Aspirin is a non-steroid, anti-inflammatory drug that primarily modulates blood clotting. It alters the platelet activation pathway through two unique, inhibitory binding sequences. Let us use the example of a paper cut to illustrate the progression of this pathway. Immediately following the slicing of the skin, the pain receptors relay the signal to the brain which releases hormones such as epinephrine, thrombin, or vasopressin. (6). The pain-modulating hormones activate phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ), an enzyme that cleaves phospholipids from the cell membrane into arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is a substrate for COX, which is an integral enzyme involved in the pathways of pain, fever, clotting, and inflammation. COX turns arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which mediate two antagonistic pathways of blood vessel control. The primary pathway utilizes thromboxane synthase to turn prostaglandin into thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). TXA 2 migrates to the platelets where it leads to platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Per our example, the accumulation of TXA 2 within the platelets at the site of the wound ceases the bleeding and closes the paper cut. (7). The second pathway turns prostaglandin into prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). PGI 2 subsequently travels to the endothelium where it causes vasodilation and decreased platelet aggregation. PGI 2 analogs are typically used to combat hypertension or restricted oxygen flow to peripheral organs. To summarize, the thromboxane A 2 pathway increases platelet aggregation via platelet activation while prostacyclin reduces platelet aggregation by acting on the endothelium. (8). Aspirin prevents the actualization of the platelet aggregation pathway by inhibiting COX. The COX enzyme has two variations: COX-1 and COX-2, which are both involved in turning arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. COX-1, however, has two unique features that distinguish it from COX-2. Firstly, only COX-1 produces TXA 2 which turns on platelet aggregation; in this sense, COX-1 is a procoagulant. Next, COX-1 leads to the synthesis of specialized prostaglandins that form the protective lining of the stomach epithelium. The two COX enzymes are also structurally different. The active site of COX-2 is larger, which allows the precursor of prostaglandins, arachidonic acid, to bypass aspirin molecules at lower doses. Therefore, a higher dose of aspirin is required to achieve analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects as compared to its antiplatelet action. The various sensitivity of COX-1 and COX-2 to aspirin explains alternate dosing regimens in medicinal practice. Lower dose aspirin targets COX-1 while higher dose aspirin inhibits COX-2. (9). In clinical settings, low-dose aspirin is prescribed for those at high risk of heart attack and stroke, but low risk of bleeding. Categorization of individuals based on these premises is difficult because individual risk factors vary. Generally, people who fall into this category are between 40 and 70 years of age, display abnormally high levels of LDL cholesterol, or have a familial history of early coronary blockage. Similarly, those with a previous history of heart attack or stroke are also prescribed low-dose aspirin to prevent a subsequent episode. For these people, aspirin is a lifesaver; it ensures a consistent blood supply to the vital organs of the body by preventing platelet aggregation and clotting. (10). On the other hand, there are certain cases where the prescription of aspirin can be life-threatening. A series of recent studies revealed that as people age beyond 70, their risk of bleeding outstrips their risk of a myocardial infarction or brain stroke. A study conducted in 2018 by McNeill and colleagues investigating the effects of aspirin on cardiovascular events and bleeding in the elderly found that prescribing low-dose aspirin to healthy individuals resulted in a higher risk of major hemorrhage but did not significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate these findings because they demonstrate how individuals taking aspirin had approximately the same incidence of cardiovascular disease as the placebo group, but more cases of major hemorrhaging. Members within this age group are also characterized by being on other medications like ibuprofen or naproxen, utilizing walking assistance, having heavy alcohol usage, and having a history of falling or bleeding episodes. While aspirin may reduce the odds of a clot-related stroke, it increases the chances of a hemorrhagic stroke or stomach damage. Therefore, aspirin is not prescribed to this cohort because the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits. It is also important to note that allergies to aspirin have precluded its usage for certain individuals.\n\n\n\n(11). Despite these limitations, aspirin remains one of the most steadfast remedies for cardiovascular problems due to its affordability and potent efficacy. However, preventative interventions remain preferable. On this front, gene therapy and genetic screening have gained much momentum in the last two decades. The successor of the human genome project, ENCODE (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements), was launched in 2014 to catalog all functional genes in the human genome. Identifying the genes involved in ailments is the first step in developing editing techniques to remediate these diseases. Not to mention, advancements in embryonic stem cell research are eagerly pacing towards a future where efficiently engineering the human genome is a feasible reality. This trend is particularly evident in China where the principles of Confucian philosophy permit research on embryonic clusters that are less than 14 days old. Additionally, computational technology is making it easier to measure and refine the gene-editing process. Evidently, with this ability to edit our health with more precision than ever before, we are on the precipice of something exciting yet equally dangerous."

      "text": "(1). What if I told you one of the earliest remedies for pain was eating tree bark? 4000 years ago, the Sumerians, a primordial civilization in the historical region of Mesopotamia discovered that eating the bark of a white willow tree relieved their ailments. How they came upon this discovery is unbeknownst, but if I were to guess, it was because someone was in such hysterical pain that they resorted to chewing through a tree to alleviate it. A couple of thousand years later in 400 BC, Hippocrates, best known for his ingenious medical prescience, prescribed willow-leaf tea to pregnant ladies on the verge of childbirth. Following the footsteps of Hippocrates, a reverend in Oxford named Edward Stone ingested willow bark which eased his suffering from an undisclosed pain. His interest gained momentum as he conducted self-experiments; he first dried the willow bark in a bag outside of a baker’s oven for three months and then pulverized it into a powder that he would use to carefully dose himself. He found that not long after, his pain was entirely eradicated. Over the course of several years, Stone extended his experiments to others and found that these salubrious effects persisted.

      "text": "(1). What if I told you one of the earliest remedies for pain was eating tree bark? 4000 years ago, the Sumerians, a primordial civilization in the historical region of Mesopotamia discovered that eating the bark of a white willow tree relieved their ailments. How they came upon this discovery is unbeknownst, but if I were to guess, it was because someone was in such hysterical pain that they resorted to chewing through a tree to alleviate it. A couple of thousand years later in 400 BC, Hippocrates, best known for his ingenious medical prescience, prescribed willow-leaf tea to pregnant ladies on the verge of childbirth. Following the footsteps of Hippocrates, a reverend in Oxford named Edward Stone ingested willow bark which eased his suffering from an undisclosed pain. His interest gained momentum as he conducted self-experiments; he first dried the willow bark in a bag outside of a baker’s oven for three months and then pulverized it into a powder that he would use to carefully dose himself. He found that not long after, his pain was entirely eradicated. Over the course of several years, Stone extended his experiments to others and found that these salubrious effects persisted. It was then that he sent a letter to the Dutch of Oxford announcing his discovery of salicylate, the precursor to aspirin. (2). It was not until the 19th century that the chemical composition of this natural analgesic became a subject of international investigation. Two scientists isolated the active ingredient - salicin, using separate methods. Henry Leroux isolated salicin from willow bark in 1826, while two years later, Johann Buchner extracted salicin from meadowsweet - another known plant with robust painkilling qualities. Decades later in 1899, the German chemist Felix Hoffman procured pure, stable acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. (3). The story behind Hoffman’s discovery of aspirin is mired in controversy. It is often stated that Hoffman’s rheumatic father prompted the search for a cure. Another scientist, however, named Arthur Eichengrün, was the man who instructed Hoffman to synthesize acetylsalicylic acid to create a safer version of sodium salicylate. The larger purpose of the experiment was unknown to Hoffman, as Eichengrün claimed in a letter. The clinical trials of aspirin began when Eichengrün dosed himself. He soon proceeded to the public once physicians validated the safety of this drug. Regardless of how it came to be, the discovery of acetylsalicylic acid highlighted a revolutionary point in the pharmaceutical industry. (4). Widely regarded as the birthmark of the drug business, aspirin quickly took off. It was named after its active compound acetylsalicylic acid and spirea alba (meadowsweet). Today, 100 billion aspirin tablets are consumed daily to treat a myriad of problems, such as those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or pericarditis. Moreover, aspirin is readily prescribed to promote healthy blood flow in those at risk of stroke and heart attack. (5). Aspirin is a non-steroid, anti-inflammatory drug that primarily modulates blood clotting. It alters the platelet activation pathway through two unique, inhibitory binding sequences. Let us use the example of a paper cut to illustrate the progression of this pathway. Immediately following the slicing of the skin, the pain receptors relay the signal to the brain which releases hormones such as epinephrine, thrombin, or vasopressin. (6). The pain-modulating hormones activate phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ), an enzyme that cleaves phospholipids from the cell membrane into arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is a substrate for COX, which is an integral enzyme involved in the pathways of pain, fever, clotting, and inflammation. COX turns arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which mediate two antagonistic pathways of blood vessel control. The primary pathway utilizes thromboxane synthase to turn prostaglandin into thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). TXA 2 migrates to the platelets where it leads to platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Per our example, the accumulation of TXA 2 within the platelets at the site of the wound ceases the bleeding and closes the paper cut. (7). The second pathway turns prostaglandin into prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). PGI 2 subsequently travels to the endothelium where it causes vasodilation and decreased platelet aggregation. PGI 2 analogs are typically used to combat hypertension or restricted oxygen flow to peripheral organs. To summarize, the thromboxane A 2 pathway increases platelet aggregation via platelet activation while prostacyclin reduces platelet aggregation by acting on the endothelium. (8). Aspirin prevents the actualization of the platelet aggregation pathway by inhibiting COX. The COX enzyme has two variations: COX-1 and COX-2, which are both involved in turning arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. COX-1, however, has two unique features that distinguish it from COX-2. Firstly, only COX-1 produces TXA 2 which turns on platelet aggregation; in this sense, COX-1 is a procoagulant. Next, COX-1 leads to the synthesis of specialized prostaglandins that form the protective lining of the stomach epithelium. The two COX enzymes are also structurally different. The active site of COX-2 is larger, which allows the precursor of prostaglandins, arachidonic acid, to bypass aspirin molecules at lower doses. Therefore, a higher dose of aspirin is required to achieve analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects as compared to its antiplatelet action. The various sensitivity of COX-1 and COX-2 to aspirin explains alternate dosing regimens in medicinal practice. Lower dose aspirin targets COX-1 while higher dose aspirin inhibits COX-2. (9). In clinical settings, low-dose aspirin is prescribed for those at high risk of heart attack and stroke, but low risk of bleeding. Categorization of individuals based on these premises is difficult because individual risk factors vary. Generally, people who fall into this category are between 40 and 70 years of age, display abnormally high levels of LDL cholesterol, or have a familial history of early coronary blockage. Similarly, those with a previous history of heart attack or stroke are also prescribed low-dose aspirin to prevent a subsequent episode. For these people, aspirin is a lifesaver; it ensures a consistent blood supply to the vital organs of the body by preventing platelet aggregation and clotting. (10). On the other hand, there are certain cases where the prescription of aspirin can be life-threatening. A series of recent studies revealed that as people age beyond 70, their risk of bleeding outstrips their risk of a myocardial infarction or brain stroke. A study conducted in 2018 by McNeill and colleagues investigating the effects of aspirin on cardiovascular events and bleeding in the elderly found that prescribing low-dose aspirin to healthy individuals resulted in a higher risk of major hemorrhage but did not significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate these findings because they demonstrate how individuals taking aspirin had approximately the same incidence of cardiovascular disease as the placebo group, but more cases of major hemorrhaging. Members within this age group are also characterized by being on other medications like ibuprofen or naproxen, utilizing walking assistance, having heavy alcohol usage, and having a history of falling or bleeding episodes. While aspirin may reduce the odds of a clot-related stroke, it increases the chances of a hemorrhagic stroke or stomach damage. Therefore, aspirin is not prescribed to this cohort because the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits. It is also important to note that allergies to aspirin have precluded its usage for certain individuals.\n\n\n\n(11). Despite these limitations, aspirin remains one of the most steadfast remedies for cardiovascular problems due to its affordability and potent efficacy. However, preventative interventions remain preferable. On this front, gene therapy and genetic screening have gained much momentum in the last two decades. The successor of the human genome project, ENCODE (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements), was launched in 2014 to catalog all functional genes in the human genome. Identifying the genes involved in ailments is the first step in developing editing techniques to remediate these diseases. Not to mention, advancements in embryonic stem cell research are eagerly pacing towards a future where efficiently engineering the human genome is a feasible reality. This trend is particularly evident in China where the principles of Confucian philosophy permit research on embryonic clusters that are less than 14 days old. Additionally, computational technology is making it easier to measure and refine the gene-editing process. Evidently, with this ability to edit our health with more precision than ever before, we are on the precipice of something exciting yet equally dangerous."

His interest gained momentum as he conducted self-experiments; he first dried the willow bark in a bag outside of a baker’s oven for three months and then pulverized it into a powder that he would use to carefully dose himself. He found that not long after, his pain was entirely eradicated. Over the course of several years, Stone extended his experiments to others and found that these salubrious effects persisted. It was then that he sent a letter to the Dutch of Oxford announcing his discovery of salicylate, the precursor to aspirin. (2). It was not until the 19th century that the chemical composition of this natural analgesic became a subject of international investigation. Two scientists isolated the active ingredient - salicin, using separate methods. Henry Leroux isolated salicin from willow bark in 1826, while two years later, Johann Buchner extracted salicin from meadowsweet - another known plant with robust painkilling qualities. Decades later in 1899, the German chemist Felix Hoffman procured pure, stable acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. (3). The story behind Hoffman’s discovery of aspirin is mired in controversy. It is often stated that Hoffman’s rheumatic father prompted the search for a cure. Another scientist, however, named Arthur Eichengrün, was the man who instructed Hoffman to synthesize acetylsalicylic acid to create a safer version of sodium salicylate. The larger purpose of the experiment was unknown to Hoffman, as Eichengrün claimed in a letter. The clinical trials of aspirin began when Eichengrün dosed himself. He soon proceeded to the public once physicians validated the safety of this drug. Regardless of how it came to be, the discovery of acetylsalicylic acid highlighted a revolutionary point in the pharmaceutical industry. (4). Widely regarded as the birthmark of the drug business, aspirin quickly took off. It was named after its active compound acetylsalicylic acid and spirea alba (meadowsweet). Today, 100 billion aspirin tablets are consumed daily to treat a myriad of problems, such as those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or pericarditis. Moreover, aspirin is readily prescribed to promote healthy blood flow in those at risk of stroke and heart attack. (5). Aspirin is a non-steroid, anti-inflammatory drug that primarily modulates blood clotting. It alters the platelet activation pathway through two unique, inhibitory binding sequences. Let us use the example of a paper cut to illustrate the progression of this pathway. Immediately following the slicing of the skin, the pain receptors relay the signal to the brain which releases hormones such as epinephrine, thrombin, or vasopressin. (6). The pain-modulating hormones activate phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ), an enzyme that cleaves phospholipids from the cell membrane into arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is a substrate for COX, which is an integral enzyme involved in the pathways of pain, fever, clotting, and inflammation. COX turns arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which mediate two antagonistic pathways of blood vessel control. The primary pathway utilizes thromboxane synthase to turn prostaglandin into thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). TXA 2 migrates to the platelets where it leads to platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Per our example, the accumulation of TXA 2 within the platelets at the site of the wound ceases the bleeding and closes the paper cut. (7). The second pathway turns prostaglandin into prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). PGI 2 subsequently travels to the endothelium where it causes vasodilation and decreased platelet aggregation. PGI 2 analogs are typically used to combat hypertension or restricted oxygen flow to peripheral organs. To summarize, the thromboxane A 2 pathway increases platelet aggregation via platelet activation while prostacyclin reduces platelet aggregation by acting on the endothelium. (8). Aspirin prevents the actualization of the platelet aggregation pathway by inhibiting COX. The COX enzyme has two variations: COX-1 and COX-2, which are both involved in turning arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. COX-1, however, has two unique features that distinguish it from COX-2. Firstly, only COX-1 produces TXA 2 which turns on platelet aggregation; in this sense, COX-1 is a procoagulant. Next, COX-1 leads to the synthesis of specialized prostaglandins that form the protective lining of the stomach epithelium. The two COX enzymes are also structurally different. The active site of COX-2 is larger, which allows the precursor of prostaglandins, arachidonic acid, to bypass aspirin molecules at lower doses. Therefore, a higher dose of aspirin is required to achieve analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects as compared to its antiplatelet action. The various sensitivity of COX-1 and COX-2 to aspirin explains alternate dosing regimens in medicinal practice. Lower dose aspirin targets COX-1 while higher dose aspirin inhibits COX-2. (9). In clinical settings, low-dose aspirin is prescribed for those at high risk of heart attack and stroke, but low risk of bleeding. Categorization of individuals based on these premises is difficult because individual risk factors vary. Generally, people who fall into this category are between 40 and 70 years of age, display abnormally high levels of LDL cholesterol, or have a familial history of early coronary blockage. Similarly, those with a previous history of heart attack or stroke are also prescribed low-dose aspirin to prevent a subsequent episode. For these people, aspirin is a lifesaver; it ensures a consistent blood supply to the vital organs of the body by preventing platelet aggregation and clotting. (10). On the other hand, there are certain cases where the prescription of aspirin can be life-threatening. A series of recent studies revealed that as people age beyond 70, their risk of bleeding outstrips their risk of a myocardial infarction or brain stroke. A study conducted in 2018 by McNeill and colleagues investigating the effects of aspirin on cardiovascular events and bleeding in the elderly found that prescribing low-dose aspirin to healthy individuals resulted in a higher risk of major hemorrhage but did not significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate these findings because they demonstrate how individuals taking aspirin had approximately the same incidence of cardiovascular disease as the placebo group, but more cases of major hemorrhaging. Members within this age group are also characterized by being on other medications like ibuprofen or naproxen, utilizing walking assistance, having heavy alcohol usage, and having a history of falling or bleeding episodes. While aspirin may reduce the odds of a clot-related stroke, it increases the chances of a hemorrhagic stroke or stomach damage. Therefore, aspirin is not prescribed to this cohort because the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits. It is also important to note that allergies to aspirin have precluded its usage for certain individuals.\n\n\n\n(11). Despite these limitations, aspirin remains one of the most steadfast remedies for cardiovascular problems due to its affordability and potent efficacy. However, preventative interventions remain preferable. On this front, gene therapy and genetic screening have gained much momentum in the last two decades. The successor of the human genome project, ENCODE (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements), was launched in 2014 to catalog all functional genes in the human genome. Identifying the genes involved in ailments is the first step in developing editing techniques to remediate these diseases. Not to mention, advancements in embryonic stem cell research are eagerly pacing towards a future where efficiently engineering the human genome is a feasible reality. This trend is particularly evident in China where the principles of Confucian philosophy permit research on embryonic clusters that are less than 14 days old. Additionally, computational technology is making it easier to measure and refine the gene-editing process. Evidently, with this ability to edit our health with more precision than ever before, we are on the precipice of something exciting yet equally dangerous."

[…] Identifying the genes involved in ailments is the first step in developing editing techniques to remediate these diseases” The author goes into depth about how advancements in gene therapy and genetic screening are allowing scientists to identify techniques that remediate diseases. In such a manner, both gene therapy and genetic screening have been vital in developing preventative interventions. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Confusion philosophy – is incorrect because paragraph 11 states that “…advancements in embryonic stem cell research are eagerly pacing towards a future where efficiently engineering the human genome is a feasible reality. This trend is particularly evident in China where the principles of Confucian philosophy permit research on embryonic clusters that are less than 14 days old.” Although Confucian philosophy resulted in research on embryonic clusters, the philosophy alone does not constitute actual preventative interventions. In other words, Confucian philosophy by itself does not create preventative measures; rather, it results in research on embryonic clusters, which could potentially lead to the development of such interventions. Option B. The Encyclopedia of RNA Elements – is incorrect because paragraph 11 states that “…preventative interventions remain preferable. […] The successor of the human genome project, ENCODE (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements), was launched in 2014 to catalog all functional genes in the human genome.” Hence, the Encyclopedia of DNA, NOT RNA elements, is an example of genetic research which could result in preventative interventions. Option C. Editing techniques that remediate healthy individuals – is incorrect because paragraph 11 states that “…preventative interventions remain preferable. On this front, gene therapy and genetic screening have gained much momentum in the last two decades. […] Identifying the genes involved in ailments is the first step in developing editing techniques to remediate these diseases.” Hence, preventative interventions involve developing editing techniques to remediate diseases, NOT healthy individuals. Option E. Stroke and hemorrhage risk – is incorrect because paragraph 11 discusses preventative interventions and highlights various examples. Stroke and hemorrhage risks, however, are not mentioned in regard to preventative interventions. Specifically, the author states that “…preventative interventions remain preferable. On this front, gene therapy and genetic screening have gained much momentum in the last two decades.” Hence, gene therapy and genetic screening constitute preventative interventions. However, it is unclear how stroke and hemorrhage risks relate to gene therapy and genetic screening, making this option incorrect.",

What if I told you one of the earliest remedies for pain was eating tree bark? 4000 years ago, the Sumerians, a primordial civilization in the historical region of Mesopotamia discovered that eating the bark of a white willow tree relieved their ailments.

Evidently, with this ability to edit our health with more precision than ever before, we are on the precipice of something exciting yet equally dangerous."

For these people, aspirin is a lifesaver; it ensures a consistent blood supply to the vital organs of the body by preventing platelet aggregation and clotting.” Hence, individuals between the ages of 40 and 70 who have a previous history of stroke require low-dose aspirin to prevent another stroke from occurring. The 49-year-old with a previous clot-related stroke best fits this description. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. 30-year-old with a genetic mutation for excessive clotting – is incorrect because paragraph 9 describes individuals who require low-dose aspirin as those that “…are between 40 and 70 years of age, display abnormally high levels of LDL cholesterol, or have a familial history of early coronary blockage. Similarly, those with a previous history of heart attack or stroke are also prescribed low-dose aspirin to prevent a subsequent episode.” The individual in this option does NOT fit this age criteria, making this option incorrect. Option B. 45-year-old with recurring stomach pain – is incorrect because paragraph 9 describes individuals who require low-dose aspirin as those that “…are between 40 and 70 years of age, display abnormally high levels of LDL cholesterol, or have a familial history of early coronary blockage. Similarly, those with a previous history of heart attack or stroke are also prescribed low-dose aspirin to prevent a subsequent episode.” Although the individual in this option fits the age criteria, there is no mention in the passage that stomach pain is a factor for aspirin prescription. Option D. 57-year-old with a cane and heart attack risk – is incorrect because aragraph 9 describes individuals who require low-dose aspirin as those that “…are between 40 and 70 years of age, display abnormally high levels of LDL cholesterol, or have a familial history of early coronary blockage.

It may be tempting to choose this option because “heart attack risk” appears to be a factor for aspirin prescription, however, the author never actually states that it is. On the other hand, Option D mentions a history of stroke, which the author explicitly states in the passage as a requirement for low-dose aspirin prescription. Thus, Option D is the better choice. Option E. 62-year-old with a family history of seizures – is incorrect because paragraph 9 describes individuals who require low-dose aspirin as those that “…are between 40 and 70 years of age, display abnormally high levels of LDL cholesterol, or have a familial history of early coronary blockage.

      "title": "Passage 2",
      "text": "(1). What if I told you one of the earliest remedies for pain was eating tree bark? 4000 years ago, the Sumerians, a primordial civilization in the historical region of Mesopotamia discovered that eating the bark of a white willow tree relieved their ailments. How they came upon this discovery is unbeknownst, but if I were to guess, it was because someone was in such hysterical pain that they resorted to chewing through a tree to alleviate it. A couple of thousand years later in 400 BC, Hippocrates, best known for his ingenious medical prescience, prescribed willow-leaf tea to pregnant ladies on the verge of childbirth. Following the footsteps of Hippocrates, a reverend in Oxford named Edward Stone ingested willow bark which eased his suffering from an undisclosed pain. His interest gained momentum as he conducted self-experiments; he first dried the willow bark in a bag outside of a baker’s oven for three months and then pulverized it into a powder that he would use to carefully dose himself. He found that not long after, his pain was entirely eradicated. Over the course of several years, Stone extended his experiments to others and found that these salubrious effects persisted. It was then that he sent a letter to the Dutch of Oxford announcing his discovery of salicylate, the precursor to aspirin. (2). It was not until the 19th century that the chemical composition of this natural analgesic became a subject of international investigation. Two scientists isolated the active ingredient - salicin, using separate methods. Henry Leroux isolated salicin from willow bark in 1826, while two years later, Johann Buchner extracted salicin from meadowsweet - another known plant with robust painkilling qualities. Decades later in 1899, the German chemist Felix Hoffman procured pure, stable acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. (3). The story behind Hoffman’s discovery of aspirin is mired in controversy. It is often stated that Hoffman’s rheumatic father prompted the search for a cure. Another scientist, however, named Arthur Eichengrün, was the man who instructed Hoffman to synthesize acetylsalicylic acid to create a safer version of sodium salicylate. The larger purpose of the experiment was unknown to Hoffman, as Eichengrün claimed in a letter. The clinical trials of aspirin began when Eichengrün dosed himself. He soon proceeded to the public once physicians validated the safety of this drug. Regardless of how it came to be, the discovery of acetylsalicylic acid highlighted a revolutionary point in the pharmaceutical industry. (4). Widely regarded as the birthmark of the drug business, aspirin quickly took off. It was named after its active compound acetylsalicylic acid and spirea alba (meadowsweet). Today, 100 billion aspirin tablets are consumed daily to treat a myriad of problems, such as those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or pericarditis. Moreover, aspirin is readily prescribed to promote healthy blood flow in those at risk of stroke and heart attack. (5). Aspirin is a non-steroid, anti-inflammatory drug that primarily modulates blood clotting. It alters the platelet activation pathway through two unique, inhibitory binding sequences. Let us use the example of a paper cut to illustrate the progression of this pathway. Immediately following the slicing of the skin, the pain receptors relay the signal to the brain which releases hormones such as epinephrine, thrombin, or vasopressin. (6). The pain-modulating hormones activate phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ), an enzyme that cleaves phospholipids from the cell membrane into arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is a substrate for COX, which is an integral enzyme involved in the pathways of pain, fever, clotting, and inflammation. COX turns arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which mediate two antagonistic pathways of blood vessel control. The primary pathway utilizes thromboxane synthase to turn prostaglandin into thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). TXA 2 migrates to the platelets where it leads to platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Per our example, the accumulation of TXA 2 within the platelets at the site of the wound ceases the bleeding and closes the paper cut. (7). The second pathway turns prostaglandin into prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). PGI 2 subsequently travels to the endothelium where it causes vasodilation and decreased platelet aggregation. PGI 2 analogs are typically used to combat hypertension or restricted oxygen flow to peripheral organs. To summarize, the thromboxane A 2 pathway increases platelet aggregation via platelet activation while prostacyclin reduces platelet aggregation by acting on the endothelium. (8). Aspirin prevents the actualization of the platelet aggregation pathway by inhibiting COX. The COX enzyme has two variations: COX-1 and COX-2, which are both involved in turning arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. COX-1, however, has two unique features that distinguish it from COX-2. Firstly, only COX-1 produces TXA 2 which turns on platelet aggregation; in this sense, COX-1 is a procoagulant. Next, COX-1 leads to the synthesis of specialized prostaglandins that form the protective lining of the stomach epithelium. The two COX enzymes are also structurally different. The active site of COX-2 is larger, which allows the precursor of prostaglandins, arachidonic acid, to bypass aspirin molecules at lower doses. Therefore, a higher dose of aspirin is required to achieve analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects as compared to its antiplatelet action. The various sensitivity of COX-1 and COX-2 to aspirin explains alternate dosing regimens in medicinal practice. Lower dose aspirin targets COX-1 while higher dose aspirin inhibits COX-2. (9). In clinical settings, low-dose aspirin is prescribed for those at high risk of heart attack and stroke, but low risk of bleeding. Categorization of individuals based on these premises is difficult because individual risk factors vary. Generally, people who fall into this category are between 40 and 70 years of age, display abnormally high levels of LDL cholesterol, or have a familial history of early coronary blockage. Similarly, those with a previous history of heart attack or stroke are also prescribed low-dose aspirin to prevent a subsequent episode. For these people, aspirin is a lifesaver; it ensures a consistent blood supply to the vital organs of the body by preventing platelet aggregation and clotting. (10). On the other hand, there are certain cases where the prescription of aspirin can be life-threatening. A series of recent studies revealed that as people age beyond 70, their risk of bleeding outstrips their risk of a myocardial infarction or brain stroke. A study conducted in 2018 by McNeill and colleagues investigating the effects of aspirin on cardiovascular events and bleeding in the elderly found that prescribing low-dose aspirin to healthy individuals resulted in a higher risk of major hemorrhage but did not significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate these findings because they demonstrate how individuals taking aspirin had approximately the same incidence of cardiovascular disease as the placebo group, but more cases of major hemorrhaging. Members within this age group are also characterized by being on other medications like ibuprofen or naproxen, utilizing walking assistance, having heavy alcohol usage, and having a history of falling or bleeding episodes. While aspirin may reduce the odds of a clot-related stroke, it increases the chances of a hemorrhagic stroke or stomach damage. Therefore, aspirin is not prescribed to this cohort because the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits. It is also important to note that allergies to aspirin have precluded its usage for certain individuals.\n\n\n\n(11). Despite these limitations, aspirin remains one of the most steadfast remedies for cardiovascular problems due to its affordability and potent efficacy. However, preventative interventions remain preferable. On this front, gene therapy and genetic screening have gained much momentum in the last two decades. The successor of the human genome project, ENCODE (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements), was launched in 2014 to catalog all functional genes in the human genome. Identifying the genes involved in ailments is the first step in developing editing techniques to remediate these diseases. Not to mention, advancements in embryonic stem cell research are eagerly pacing towards a future where efficiently engineering the human genome is a feasible reality. This trend is particularly evident in China where the principles of Confucian philosophy permit research on embryonic clusters that are less than 14 days old. Additionally, computational technology is making it easier to measure and refine the gene-editing process. Evidently, with this ability to edit our health with more precision than ever before, we are on the precipice of something exciting yet equally dangerous."

      "text": "(1). What if I told you one of the earliest remedies for pain was eating tree bark? 4000 years ago, the Sumerians, a primordial civilization in the historical region of Mesopotamia discovered that eating the bark of a white willow tree relieved their ailments. How they came upon this discovery is unbeknownst, but if I were to guess, it was because someone was in such hysterical pain that they resorted to chewing through a tree to alleviate it. A couple of thousand years later in 400 BC, Hippocrates, best known for his ingenious medical prescience, prescribed willow-leaf tea to pregnant ladies on the verge of childbirth. Following the footsteps of Hippocrates, a reverend in Oxford named Edward Stone ingested willow bark which eased his suffering from an undisclosed pain. His interest gained momentum as he conducted self-experiments; he first dried the willow bark in a bag outside of a baker’s oven for three months and then pulverized it into a powder that he would use to carefully dose himself. He found that not long after, his pain was entirely eradicated. Over the course of several years, Stone extended his experiments to others and found that these salubrious effects persisted. It was then that he sent a letter to the Dutch of Oxford announcing his discovery of salicylate, the precursor to aspirin. (2). It was not until the 19th century that the chemical composition of this natural analgesic became a subject of international investigation. Two scientists isolated the active ingredient - salicin, using separate methods. Henry Leroux isolated salicin from willow bark in 1826, while two years later, Johann Buchner extracted salicin from meadowsweet - another known plant with robust painkilling qualities. Decades later in 1899, the German chemist Felix Hoffman procured pure, stable acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. (3). The story behind Hoffman’s discovery of aspirin is mired in controversy. It is often stated that Hoffman’s rheumatic father prompted the search for a cure. Another scientist, however, named Arthur Eichengrün, was the man who instructed Hoffman to synthesize acetylsalicylic acid to create a safer version of sodium salicylate. The larger purpose of the experiment was unknown to Hoffman, as Eichengrün claimed in a letter. The clinical trials of aspirin began when Eichengrün dosed himself. He soon proceeded to the public once physicians validated the safety of this drug. Regardless of how it came to be, the discovery of acetylsalicylic acid highlighted a revolutionary point in the pharmaceutical industry. (4). Widely regarded as the birthmark of the drug business, aspirin quickly took off. It was named after its active compound acetylsalicylic acid and spirea alba (meadowsweet). Today, 100 billion aspirin tablets are consumed daily to treat a myriad of problems, such as those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or pericarditis. Moreover, aspirin is readily prescribed to promote healthy blood flow in those at risk of stroke and heart attack. (5). Aspirin is a non-steroid, anti-inflammatory drug that primarily modulates blood clotting. It alters the platelet activation pathway through two unique, inhibitory binding sequences. Let us use the example of a paper cut to illustrate the progression of this pathway. Immediately following the slicing of the skin, the pain receptors relay the signal to the brain which releases hormones such as epinephrine, thrombin, or vasopressin. (6). The pain-modulating hormones activate phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ), an enzyme that cleaves phospholipids from the cell membrane into arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is a substrate for COX, which is an integral enzyme involved in the pathways of pain, fever, clotting, and inflammation. COX turns arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which mediate two antagonistic pathways of blood vessel control. The primary pathway utilizes thromboxane synthase to turn prostaglandin into thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). TXA 2 migrates to the platelets where it leads to platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Per our example, the accumulation of TXA 2 within the platelets at the site of the wound ceases the bleeding and closes the paper cut. (7). The second pathway turns prostaglandin into prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). PGI 2 subsequently travels to the endothelium where it causes vasodilation and decreased platelet aggregation. PGI 2 analogs are typically used to combat hypertension or restricted oxygen flow to peripheral organs. To summarize, the thromboxane A 2 pathway increases platelet aggregation via platelet activation while prostacyclin reduces platelet aggregation by acting on the endothelium. (8). Aspirin prevents the actualization of the platelet aggregation pathway by inhibiting COX. The COX enzyme has two variations: COX-1 and COX-2, which are both involved in turning arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. COX-1, however, has two unique features that distinguish it from COX-2. Firstly, only COX-1 produces TXA 2 which turns on platelet aggregation; in this sense, COX-1 is a procoagulant. Next, COX-1 leads to the synthesis of specialized prostaglandins that form the protective lining of the stomach epithelium. The two COX enzymes are also structurally different. The active site of COX-2 is larger, which allows the precursor of prostaglandins, arachidonic acid, to bypass aspirin molecules at lower doses. Therefore, a higher dose of aspirin is required to achieve analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects as compared to its antiplatelet action. The various sensitivity of COX-1 and COX-2 to aspirin explains alternate dosing regimens in medicinal practice. Lower dose aspirin targets COX-1 while higher dose aspirin inhibits COX-2. (9). In clinical settings, low-dose aspirin is prescribed for those at high risk of heart attack and stroke, but low risk of bleeding. Categorization of individuals based on these premises is difficult because individual risk factors vary. Generally, people who fall into this category are between 40 and 70 years of age, display abnormally high levels of LDL cholesterol, or have a familial history of early coronary blockage. Similarly, those with a previous history of heart attack or stroke are also prescribed low-dose aspirin to prevent a subsequent episode. For these people, aspirin is a lifesaver; it ensures a consistent blood supply to the vital organs of the body by preventing platelet aggregation and clotting. (10). On the other hand, there are certain cases where the prescription of aspirin can be life-threatening. A series of recent studies revealed that as people age beyond 70, their risk of bleeding outstrips their risk of a myocardial infarction or brain stroke. A study conducted in 2018 by McNeill and colleagues investigating the effects of aspirin on cardiovascular events and bleeding in the elderly found that prescribing low-dose aspirin to healthy individuals resulted in a higher risk of major hemorrhage but did not significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate these findings because they demonstrate how individuals taking aspirin had approximately the same incidence of cardiovascular disease as the placebo group, but more cases of major hemorrhaging. Members within this age group are also characterized by being on other medications like ibuprofen or naproxen, utilizing walking assistance, having heavy alcohol usage, and having a history of falling or bleeding episodes. While aspirin may reduce the odds of a clot-related stroke, it increases the chances of a hemorrhagic stroke or stomach damage. Therefore, aspirin is not prescribed to this cohort because the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits. It is also important to note that allergies to aspirin have precluded its usage for certain individuals.\n\n\n\n(11). Despite these limitations, aspirin remains one of the most steadfast remedies for cardiovascular problems due to its affordability and potent efficacy. However, preventative interventions remain preferable. On this front, gene therapy and genetic screening have gained much momentum in the last two decades. The successor of the human genome project, ENCODE (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements), was launched in 2014 to catalog all functional genes in the human genome. Identifying the genes involved in ailments is the first step in developing editing techniques to remediate these diseases. Not to mention, advancements in embryonic stem cell research are eagerly pacing towards a future where efficiently engineering the human genome is a feasible reality. This trend is particularly evident in China where the principles of Confucian philosophy permit research on embryonic clusters that are less than 14 days old. Additionally, computational technology is making it easier to measure and refine the gene-editing process. Evidently, with this ability to edit our health with more precision than ever before, we are on the precipice of something exciting yet equally dangerous."

      "text": "(1). What if I told you one of the earliest remedies for pain was eating tree bark? 4000 years ago, the Sumerians, a primordial civilization in the historical region of Mesopotamia discovered that eating the bark of a white willow tree relieved their ailments. How they came upon this discovery is unbeknownst, but if I were to guess, it was because someone was in such hysterical pain that they resorted to chewing through a tree to alleviate it. A couple of thousand years later in 400 BC, Hippocrates, best known for his ingenious medical prescience, prescribed willow-leaf tea to pregnant ladies on the verge of childbirth. Following the footsteps of Hippocrates, a reverend in Oxford named Edward Stone ingested willow bark which eased his suffering from an undisclosed pain. His interest gained momentum as he conducted self-experiments; he first dried the willow bark in a bag outside of a baker’s oven for three months and then pulverized it into a powder that he would use to carefully dose himself. He found that not long after, his pain was entirely eradicated. Over the course of several years, Stone extended his experiments to others and found that these salubrious effects persisted. It was then that he sent a letter to the Dutch of Oxford announcing his discovery of salicylate, the precursor to aspirin. (2). It was not until the 19th century that the chemical composition of this natural analgesic became a subject of international investigation. Two scientists isolated the active ingredient - salicin, using separate methods. Henry Leroux isolated salicin from willow bark in 1826, while two years later, Johann Buchner extracted salicin from meadowsweet - another known plant with robust painkilling qualities. Decades later in 1899, the German chemist Felix Hoffman procured pure, stable acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. (3). The story behind Hoffman’s discovery of aspirin is mired in controversy. It is often stated that Hoffman’s rheumatic father prompted the search for a cure. Another scientist, however, named Arthur Eichengrün, was the man who instructed Hoffman to synthesize acetylsalicylic acid to create a safer version of sodium salicylate. The larger purpose of the experiment was unknown to Hoffman, as Eichengrün claimed in a letter. The clinical trials of aspirin began when Eichengrün dosed himself. He soon proceeded to the public once physicians validated the safety of this drug. Regardless of how it came to be, the discovery of acetylsalicylic acid highlighted a revolutionary point in the pharmaceutical industry. (4). Widely regarded as the birthmark of the drug business, aspirin quickly took off. It was named after its active compound acetylsalicylic acid and spirea alba (meadowsweet). Today, 100 billion aspirin tablets are consumed daily to treat a myriad of problems, such as those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or pericarditis. Moreover, aspirin is readily prescribed to promote healthy blood flow in those at risk of stroke and heart attack. (5). Aspirin is a non-steroid, anti-inflammatory drug that primarily modulates blood clotting. It alters the platelet activation pathway through two unique, inhibitory binding sequences. Let us use the example of a paper cut to illustrate the progression of this pathway. Immediately following the slicing of the skin, the pain receptors relay the signal to the brain which releases hormones such as epinephrine, thrombin, or vasopressin. (6). The pain-modulating hormones activate phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ), an enzyme that cleaves phospholipids from the cell membrane into arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is a substrate for COX, which is an integral enzyme involved in the pathways of pain, fever, clotting, and inflammation. COX turns arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which mediate two antagonistic pathways of blood vessel control. The primary pathway utilizes thromboxane synthase to turn prostaglandin into thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). TXA 2 migrates to the platelets where it leads to platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Per our example, the accumulation of TXA 2 within the platelets at the site of the wound ceases the bleeding and closes the paper cut. (7). The second pathway turns prostaglandin into prostacyclin (PGI 2 ). PGI 2 subsequently travels to the endothelium where it causes vasodilation and decreased platelet aggregation. PGI 2 analogs are typically used to combat hypertension or restricted oxygen flow to peripheral organs. To summarize, the thromboxane A 2 pathway increases platelet aggregation via platelet activation while prostacyclin reduces platelet aggregation by acting on the endothelium. (8). Aspirin prevents the actualization of the platelet aggregation pathway by inhibiting COX. The COX enzyme has two variations: COX-1 and COX-2, which are both involved in turning arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. COX-1, however, has two unique features that distinguish it from COX-2. Firstly, only COX-1 produces TXA 2 which turns on platelet aggregation; in this sense, COX-1 is a procoagulant. Next, COX-1 leads to the synthesis of specialized prostaglandins that form the protective lining of the stomach epithelium. The two COX enzymes are also structurally different. The active site of COX-2 is larger, which allows the precursor of prostaglandins, arachidonic acid, to bypass aspirin molecules at lower doses. Therefore, a higher dose of aspirin is required to achieve analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects as compared to its antiplatelet action. The various sensitivity of COX-1 and COX-2 to aspirin explains alternate dosing regimens in medicinal practice. Lower dose aspirin targets COX-1 while higher dose aspirin inhibits COX-2. (9). In clinical settings, low-dose aspirin is prescribed for those at high risk of heart attack and stroke, but low risk of bleeding. Categorization of individuals based on these premises is difficult because individual risk factors vary. Generally, people who fall into this category are between 40 and 70 years of age, display abnormally high levels of LDL cholesterol, or have a familial history of early coronary blockage. Similarly, those with a previous history of heart attack or stroke are also prescribed low-dose aspirin to prevent a subsequent episode. For these people, aspirin is a lifesaver; it ensures a consistent blood supply to the vital organs of the body by preventing platelet aggregation and clotting. (10). On the other hand, there are certain cases where the prescription of aspirin can be life-threatening. A series of recent studies revealed that as people age beyond 70, their risk of bleeding outstrips their risk of a myocardial infarction or brain stroke. A study conducted in 2018 by McNeill and colleagues investigating the effects of aspirin on cardiovascular events and bleeding in the elderly found that prescribing low-dose aspirin to healthy individuals resulted in a higher risk of major hemorrhage but did not significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate these findings because they demonstrate how individuals taking aspirin had approximately the same incidence of cardiovascular disease as the placebo group, but more cases of major hemorrhaging. Members within this age group are also characterized by being on other medications like ibuprofen or naproxen, utilizing walking assistance, having heavy alcohol usage, and having a history of falling or bleeding episodes. While aspirin may reduce the odds of a clot-related stroke, it increases the chances of a hemorrhagic stroke or stomach damage. Therefore, aspirin is not prescribed to this cohort because the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits. It is also important to note that allergies to aspirin have precluded its usage for certain individuals.\n\n\n\n(11). Despite these limitations, aspirin remains one of the most steadfast remedies for cardiovascular problems due to its affordability and potent efficacy. However, preventative interventions remain preferable. On this front, gene therapy and genetic screening have gained much momentum in the last two decades. The successor of the human genome project, ENCODE (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements), was launched in 2014 to catalog all functional genes in the human genome. Identifying the genes involved in ailments is the first step in developing editing techniques to remediate these diseases. Not to mention, advancements in embryonic stem cell research are eagerly pacing towards a future where efficiently engineering the human genome is a feasible reality. This trend is particularly evident in China where the principles of Confucian philosophy permit research on embryonic clusters that are less than 14 days old. Additionally, computational technology is making it easier to measure and refine the gene-editing process. Evidently, with this ability to edit our health with more precision than ever before, we are on the precipice of something exciting yet equally dangerous."

      "text": "(1). In 1987, a worldwide survey of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was published by Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson in Nature Magazine. The survey’s point was that “all mtDNAs stem from one woman” and that she probably lived in Africa around 200,000 years ago. When the media found out from Wilson (one of the authors of the paper) that “Mitochondrial Eve” or “African Eve” had been found, the story became a sensation. Had scientists found “the mother of us all”?\n\n(2). Most people know about the nuclei of cells and that genetic information from both parents is found in the nucleus. Humans have 46 chromosomes which they inherit from both their parents. DNA from both a mother and father are recombined, which allows the resulting children to inherit traits from both parents.\n\n(3). However, there is also DNA located in other parts of the cell. In the cytoplasm, organelles called “mitochondria”, which work to provide energy for the cell through ATP, also have DNA. This DNA, however, does not appear to come from both parents. Instead, it comes only from the mother. Thus, our mtDNA is, in essence, identical to that of our mothers. MtDNA is transferred from mother to daughter, generation after generation. The mtDNA that a son gets from his mother represents a dead-end street, since his mtDNA will not be used in his children.\n\n(4). After the initial discovery of the “Mitochondrial Eve,” Wilson felt uneasy about using the name “Eve” because it caused many to assume that Eve was the only woman alive during her time, much like what is written in Genesis of the Bible about Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Additionally, the usual evolutionary timescale attributed to man was incompatible with the short time frame of 200,000 years. Instead, it is believed that man has been around for a much longer period. For instance, “Java man” is thought to be 800,000 years old. Homo erectus specimens are found throughout the world, and over forty specimens of Asian Homo erectus discovered in China have been dated 220,000 to 500,000 years of age. “Lucy” is the name given to the remains of one such early specimen, thought to be one of the first to stand upright; it is predicted that she is at least one million years of age.\n\n(5). Furthermore, the story of Mitochondrial Eve is not what paleoanthropologists wanted to hear. Paleoanthropologists believed that man came from Africa, but they assumed it happened one million years ago. If Eve had lived a million years ago, most paleoanthropologists would have accepted the idea with open arms because this would mean that the Mitochondrial Eve data match the existing data that they (the paleoanthropologists) already had. It now seemed that several waves of humans left Africa and that each wave seemed to have taken over the world. Eve must have lived in Africa 200,000 years ago, with her descendants migrating from the continent approximately 100,000 years ago to take over the earth, after which all previous types of man vanished from the planet without leaving a trace in our genetic record! In addition, there is no evidence from the mtDNA data to suggest that Eve’s descendants interbred with the older man types at all.\n\n(6). Such an overtaking of the world’s population on the part of Eve’s descendants in the last wave of migration - a mere 100,000 years ago - was a point of contention, mainly because many paleoanthropologists saw a continuity of genetic traits between Homo erectus and modern man. A continuity of genetic traits in fossil remains suggests that Homo erectus has a direct genetic link to the more modern form of man, which means that the modern Chinese would be the descendants of the Chinese Erectus. Paleoanthropologists see this continuity as happening in separate parts of the world at the same time, in a parallel evolutionary process - what they see in the field is: African Erectus evolving into modern Africans, Chinese Erectus evolving into modern Chinese, European Erectus evolving into Neanderthals and then modern Europeans, and so forth. The features of modern Europeans, including a prominent nose and the shape of the rear end of their cranium, are closer in appearance to classic Neanderthals than are the features of any other living human population.\n\n(7). It is easy to tell feelings were running high regarding the fight between the “out-of-Africa” theory and the “multi-regional continuity” theory, which stipulates that modern man arose from various places on the earth at the same time. The critics of the Eve story, who saw that the mitochondrial data did not fit with fossils in the field showing a multi-regional continuity, began to voice several complaints against the mitochondrial data. These complaints were as follows: the mitochondrial data were determined using restriction analysis rather than DNA sequencing; restriction analysis is an enzymatic method that can give false results at times; they used African Americans rather than Africans from Africa to represent native Africans in their study and, as a result, did not get a proper sampling of the African population; they used inferior methods to build a phylogenetic tree; they used a program called PAUP which was written with the intent of determining evolutionary relationships - the program gave different results when you entered the data in a different order, and the answer given was dependent upon the order that the data was entered into the computer.\n\n(8). The Mitochondrial Eve hypothesis was in deep trouble until Harvard’s Maryellen Ruvolo presented new data that used DNA sequencing rather than restriction analysis to study a part of the cytochrome oxidase gene found in the mitochondrial genome. The original work was criticized because it was based on a rapidly evolving portion of the mitochondria, but Ruvolo’s work was based on a slow-evolving portion of the mitochondrial genome, and she got the same answer as is found in the original work. The “multi-regional continuity” supporters were hoping for an older date, such as one million years. This date would have allowed the mitochondrial Eve data to fit within their accepted theory; however, that did not happen.\n\n(9). Currently, the battle is still raging over the history of Modern Human Origins, and we still have the same two irreconcilable scientific camps with data that do not fit together. One camp believes the mitochondrial Eve data and supports the “out-of-Africa” theory, where Eve’s descendants, upon leaving Africa, are seen as taking over the whole world and overcoming all the other types of man with no sign of inbreeding, only 100,000 years ago. The other camp believes in a continuous genetic change of fossil data across the globe, which seems to suggest that the human race has been advancing across the globe in a parallel multi-regional evolutionary process. If Eve’s descendants overtook the whole world, there would be a break in the type of fossils seen in the field. The older fossils would not relate to the newer fossils that descended from Eve, and there would be no way to explain the continuous change of fossil remains that are seen around the world using the Mitochondrial Eve data.\n\n(10). There seems to be no way for all the data to presently fit together. As Kip Thorne from Australian National University mentioned: “The fossil evidence is really scrappy. There just isn’t enough of it.” However, it does not look like the situation will change anytime soon, and Wolpoff thinks that the controversy will continue until all involved are dead. The next generation, he says, will have to decide. Perhaps advancements in both fields will someday decide the truth about the history of our race."

Such an overtaking of the world’s population on the part of Eve’s descendants in the last wave of migration - a mere 100,000 years ago - was a point of contention, mainly because many paleoanthropologists saw a continuity of genetic traits between Homo erectus and modern man. A continuity of genetic traits in fossil remains suggests that Homo erectus has a direct genetic link to the more modern form of man, which means that the modern Chinese would be the descendants of the Chinese Erectus. Paleoanthropologists see this continuity as happening in separate parts of the world at the same time, in a parallel evolutionary process - what they see in the field is: African Erectus evolving into modern Africans, Chinese Erectus evolving into modern Chinese, European Erectus evolving into Neanderthals and then modern Europeans, and so forth. The features of modern Europeans, including a prominent nose and the shape of the rear end of their cranium, are closer in appearance to classic Neanderthals than are the features of any other living human population.\n\n(7). It is easy to tell feelings were running high regarding the fight between the “out-of-Africa” theory and the “multi-regional continuity” theory, which stipulates that modern man arose from various places on the earth at the same time. The critics of the Eve story, who saw that the mitochondrial data did not fit with fossils in the field showing a multi-regional continuity, began to voice several complaints against the mitochondrial data. These complaints were as follows: the mitochondrial data were determined using restriction analysis rather than DNA sequencing; restriction analysis is an enzymatic method that can give false results at times; they used African Americans rather than Africans from Africa to represent native Africans in their study and, as a result, did not get a proper sampling of the African population; they used inferior methods to build a phylogenetic tree; they used a program called PAUP which was written with the intent of determining evolutionary relationships - the program gave different results when you entered the data in a different order, and the answer given was dependent upon the order that the data was entered into the computer.\n\n(8). The Mitochondrial Eve hypothesis was in deep trouble until Harvard’s Maryellen Ruvolo presented new data that used DNA sequencing rather than restriction analysis to study a part of the cytochrome oxidase gene found in the mitochondrial genome. The original work was criticized because it was based on a rapidly evolving portion of the mitochondria, but Ruvolo’s work was based on a slow-evolving portion of the mitochondrial genome, and she got the same answer as is found in the original work. The “multi-regional continuity” supporters were hoping for an older date, such as one million years. This date would have allowed the mitochondrial Eve data to fit within their accepted theory; however, that did not happen.\n\n(9). Currently, the battle is still raging over the history of Modern Human Origins, and we still have the same two irreconcilable scientific camps with data that do not fit together. One camp believes the mitochondrial Eve data and supports the “out-of-Africa” theory, where Eve’s descendants, upon leaving Africa, are seen as taking over the whole world and overcoming all the other types of man with no sign of inbreeding, only 100,000 years ago. The other camp believes in a continuous genetic change of fossil data across the globe, which seems to suggest that the human race has been advancing across the globe in a parallel multi-regional evolutionary process. If Eve’s descendants overtook the whole world, there would be a break in the type of fossils seen in the field. The older fossils would not relate to the newer fossils that descended from Eve, and there would be no way to explain the continuous change of fossil remains that are seen around the world using the Mitochondrial Eve data.\n\n(10). There seems to be no way for all the data to presently fit together. As Kip Thorne from Australian National University mentioned: “The fossil evidence is really scrappy. There just isn’t enough of it.” However, it does not look like the situation will change anytime soon, and Wolpoff thinks that the controversy will continue until all involved are dead. The next generation, he says, will have to decide. Perhaps advancements in both fields will someday decide the truth about the history of our race."

      "text": "(1). In 1987, a worldwide survey of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was published by Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson in Nature Magazine. The survey’s point was that “all mtDNAs stem from one woman” and that she probably lived in Africa around 200,000 years ago. When the media found out from Wilson (one of the authors of the paper) that “Mitochondrial Eve” or “African Eve” had been found, the story became a sensation. Had scientists found “the mother of us all”?\n\n(2). Most people know about the nuclei of cells and that genetic information from both parents is found in the nucleus. Humans have 46 chromosomes which they inherit from both their parents. DNA from both a mother and father are recombined, which allows the resulting children to inherit traits from both parents.\n\n(3). However, there is also DNA located in other parts of the cell. In the cytoplasm, organelles called “mitochondria”, which work to provide energy for the cell through ATP, also have DNA. This DNA, however, does not appear to come from both parents. Instead, it comes only from the mother. Thus, our mtDNA is, in essence, identical to that of our mothers. MtDNA is transferred from mother to daughter, generation after generation. The mtDNA that a son gets from his mother represents a dead-end street, since his mtDNA will not be used in his children.\n\n(4). After the initial discovery of the “Mitochondrial Eve,” Wilson felt uneasy about using the name “Eve” because it caused many to assume that Eve was the only woman alive during her time, much like what is written in Genesis of the Bible about Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Additionally, the usual evolutionary timescale attributed to man was incompatible with the short time frame of 200,000 years. Instead, it is believed that man has been around for a much longer period. For instance, “Java man” is thought to be 800,000 years old. Homo erectus specimens are found throughout the world, and over forty specimens of Asian Homo erectus discovered in China have been dated 220,000 to 500,000 years of age. “Lucy” is the name given to the remains of one such early specimen, thought to be one of the first to stand upright; it is predicted that she is at least one million years of age.\n\n(5). Furthermore, the story of Mitochondrial Eve is not what paleoanthropologists wanted to hear. Paleoanthropologists believed that man came from Africa, but they assumed it happened one million years ago. If Eve had lived a million years ago, most paleoanthropologists would have accepted the idea with open arms because this would mean that the Mitochondrial Eve data match the existing data that they (the paleoanthropologists) already had. It now seemed that several waves of humans left Africa and that each wave seemed to have taken over the world. Eve must have lived in Africa 200,000 years ago, with her descendants migrating from the continent approximately 100,000 years ago to take over the earth, after which all previous types of man vanished from the planet without leaving a trace in our genetic record!

In paragraph 5, the author says that: “Eve must have lived in Africa 200,000 years ago, with her descendants migrating from the continent approximately 100,000 years ago to take over the earth, after which all previous types of man vanished from the planet without leaving a trace in our genetic record!” This would support the out of Africa theory, not go against it.",

Additionally, the usual evolutionary timescale attributed to man was incompatible with the short time frame of 200,000 years. Instead, it is believed that man has been around for a much longer period. For instance, “Java man” is thought to be 800,000 years old. Homo erectus specimens are found throughout the world, and over forty specimens of Asian Homo erectus discovered in China have been dated 220,000 to 500,000 years of age. “Lucy” is the name given to the remains of one such early specimen, thought to be one of the first to stand upright; it is predicted that she is at least one million years of age.\n\n(5).

If Eve had lived a million years ago, most paleoanthropologists would have accepted the idea with open arms because this would mean that the Mitochondrial Eve data match the existing data that they (the paleoanthropologists) already had. It now seemed that several waves of humans left Africa and that each wave seemed to have taken over the world. Eve must have lived in Africa 200,000 years ago, with her descendants migrating from the continent approximately 100,000 years ago to take over the earth, after which all previous types of man vanished from the planet without leaving a trace in our genetic record! In addition, there is no evidence from the mtDNA data to suggest that Eve’s descendants interbred with the older man types at all.\n\n(6). Such an overtaking of the world’s population on the part of Eve’s descendants in the last wave of migration - a mere 100,000 years ago - was a point of contention, mainly because many paleoanthropologists saw a continuity of genetic traits between Homo erectus and modern man. A continuity of genetic traits in fossil remains suggests that Homo erectus has a direct genetic link to the more modern form of man, which means that the modern Chinese would be the descendants of the Chinese Erectus. Paleoanthropologists see this continuity as happening in separate parts of the world at the same time, in a parallel evolutionary process - what they see in the field is: African Erectus evolving into modern Africans, Chinese Erectus evolving into modern Chinese, European Erectus evolving into Neanderthals and then modern Europeans, and so forth. The features of modern Europeans, including a prominent nose and the shape of the rear end of their cranium, are closer in appearance to classic Neanderthals than are the features of any other living human population.\n\n(7). It is easy to tell feelings were running high regarding the fight between the “out-of-Africa” theory and the “multi-regional continuity” theory, which stipulates that modern man arose from various places on the earth at the same time. The critics of the Eve story, who saw that the mitochondrial data did not fit with fossils in the field showing a multi-regional continuity, began to voice several complaints against the mitochondrial data. These complaints were as follows: the mitochondrial data were determined using restriction analysis rather than DNA sequencing; restriction analysis is an enzymatic method that can give false results at times; they used African Americans rather than Africans from Africa to represent native Africans in their study and, as a result, did not get a proper sampling of the African population; they used inferior methods to build a phylogenetic tree; they used a program called PAUP which was written with the intent of determining evolutionary relationships - the program gave different results when you entered the data in a different order, and the answer given was dependent upon the order that the data was entered into the computer.\n\n(8).

      "text": "(1). In 1987, a worldwide survey of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was published by Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson in Nature Magazine. The survey’s point was that “all mtDNAs stem from one woman” and that she probably lived in Africa around 200,000 years ago. When the media found out from Wilson (one of the authors of the paper) that “Mitochondrial Eve” or “African Eve” had been found, the story became a sensation. Had scientists found “the mother of us all”?\n\n(2). Most people know about the nuclei of cells and that genetic information from both parents is found in the nucleus. Humans have 46 chromosomes which they inherit from both their parents. DNA from both a mother and father are recombined, which allows the resulting children to inherit traits from both parents.\n\n(3). However, there is also DNA located in other parts of the cell. In the cytoplasm, organelles called “mitochondria”, which work to provide energy for the cell through ATP, also have DNA. This DNA, however, does not appear to come from both parents. Instead, it comes only from the mother. Thus, our mtDNA is, in essence, identical to that of our mothers. MtDNA is transferred from mother to daughter, generation after generation. The mtDNA that a son gets from his mother represents a dead-end street, since his mtDNA will not be used in his children.\n\n(4). After the initial discovery of the “Mitochondrial Eve,” Wilson felt uneasy about using the name “Eve” because it caused many to assume that Eve was the only woman alive during her time, much like what is written in Genesis of the Bible about Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Additionally, the usual evolutionary timescale attributed to man was incompatible with the short time frame of 200,000 years. Instead, it is believed that man has been around for a much longer period. For instance, “Java man” is thought to be 800,000 years old. Homo erectus specimens are found throughout the world, and over forty specimens of Asian Homo erectus discovered in China have been dated 220,000 to 500,000 years of age. “Lucy” is the name given to the remains of one such early specimen, thought to be one of the first to stand upright; it is predicted that she is at least one million years of age.\n\n(5). Furthermore, the story of Mitochondrial Eve is not what paleoanthropologists wanted to hear. Paleoanthropologists believed that man came from Africa, but they assumed it happened one million years ago. If Eve had lived a million years ago, most paleoanthropologists would have accepted the idea with open arms because this would mean that the Mitochondrial Eve data match the existing data that they (the paleoanthropologists) already had. It now seemed that several waves of humans left Africa and that each wave seemed to have taken over the world. Eve must have lived in Africa 200,000 years ago, with her descendants migrating from the continent approximately 100,000 years ago to take over the earth, after which all previous types of man vanished from the planet without leaving a trace in our genetic record! In addition, there is no evidence from the mtDNA data to suggest that Eve’s descendants interbred with the older man types at all.\n\n(6). Such an overtaking of the world’s population on the part of Eve’s descendants in the last wave of migration - a mere 100,000 years ago - was a point of contention, mainly because many paleoanthropologists saw a continuity of genetic traits between Homo erectus and modern man. A continuity of genetic traits in fossil remains suggests that Homo erectus has a direct genetic link to the more modern form of man, which means that the modern Chinese would be the descendants of the Chinese Erectus. Paleoanthropologists see this continuity as happening in separate parts of the world at the same time, in a parallel evolutionary process - what they see in the field is: African Erectus evolving into modern Africans, Chinese Erectus evolving into modern Chinese, European Erectus evolving into Neanderthals and then modern Europeans, and so forth. The features of modern Europeans, including a prominent nose and the shape of the rear end of their cranium, are closer in appearance to classic Neanderthals than are the features of any other living human population.\n\n(7). It is easy to tell feelings were running high regarding the fight between the “out-of-Africa” theory and the “multi-regional continuity” theory, which stipulates that modern man arose from various places on the earth at the same time. The critics of the Eve story, who saw that the mitochondrial data did not fit with fossils in the field showing a multi-regional continuity, began to voice several complaints against the mitochondrial data. These complaints were as follows: the mitochondrial data were determined using restriction analysis rather than DNA sequencing; restriction analysis is an enzymatic method that can give false results at times; they used African Americans rather than Africans from Africa to represent native Africans in their study and, as a result, did not get a proper sampling of the African population; they used inferior methods to build a phylogenetic tree; they used a program called PAUP which was written with the intent of determining evolutionary relationships - the program gave different results when you entered the data in a different order, and the answer given was dependent upon the order that the data was entered into the computer.\n\n(8). The Mitochondrial Eve hypothesis was in deep trouble until Harvard’s Maryellen Ruvolo presented new data that used DNA sequencing rather than restriction analysis to study a part of the cytochrome oxidase gene found in the mitochondrial genome. The original work was criticized because it was based on a rapidly evolving portion of the mitochondria, but Ruvolo’s work was based on a slow-evolving portion of the mitochondrial genome, and she got the same answer as is found in the original work. The “multi-regional continuity” supporters were hoping for an older date, such as one million years. This date would have allowed the mitochondrial Eve data to fit within their accepted theory; however, that did not happen.\n\n(9). Currently, the battle is still raging over the history of Modern Human Origins, and we still have the same two irreconcilable scientific camps with data that do not fit together. One camp believes the mitochondrial Eve data and supports the “out-of-Africa” theory, where Eve’s descendants, upon leaving Africa, are seen as taking over the whole world and overcoming all the other types of man with no sign of inbreeding, only 100,000 years ago. The other camp believes in a continuous genetic change of fossil data across the globe, which seems to suggest that the human race has been advancing across the globe in a parallel multi-regional evolutionary process. If Eve’s descendants overtook the whole world, there would be a break in the type of fossils seen in the field. The older fossils would not relate to the newer fossils that descended from Eve, and there would be no way to explain the continuous change of fossil remains that are seen around the world using the Mitochondrial Eve data.\n\n(10). There seems to be no way for all the data to presently fit together. As Kip Thorne from Australian National University mentioned: “The fossil evidence is really scrappy. There just isn’t enough of it.” However, it does not look like the situation will change anytime soon, and Wolpoff thinks that the controversy will continue until all involved are dead.

The critics of the Eve story, who saw that the mitochondrial data did not fit with fossils in the field showing a multi-regional continuity, began to voice several complaints against the mitochondrial data. These complaints were as follows: the mitochondrial data were determined using restriction analysis rather than DNA sequencing; restriction analysis is an enzymatic method that can give false results at times; they used African Americans rather than Africans from Africa to represent native Africans in their study and, as a result, did not get a proper sampling of the African population; they used inferior methods to build a phylogenetic tree; they used a program called PAUP which was written with the intent of determining evolutionary relationships - the program gave different results when you entered the data in a different order, and the answer given was dependent upon the order that the data was entered into the computer.\n\n(8). The Mitochondrial Eve hypothesis was in deep trouble until Harvard’s Maryellen Ruvolo presented new data that used DNA sequencing rather than restriction analysis to study a part of the cytochrome oxidase gene found in the mitochondrial genome. The original work was criticized because it was based on a rapidly evolving portion of the mitochondria, but Ruvolo’s work was based on a slow-evolving portion of the mitochondrial genome, and she got the same answer as is found in the original work. The “multi-regional continuity” supporters were hoping for an older date, such as one million years. This date would have allowed the mitochondrial Eve data to fit within their accepted theory; however, that did not happen.\n\n(9). Currently, the battle is still raging over the history of Modern Human Origins, and we still have the same two irreconcilable scientific camps with data that do not fit together. One camp believes the mitochondrial Eve data and supports the “out-of-Africa” theory, where Eve’s descendants, upon leaving Africa, are seen as taking over the whole world and overcoming all the other types of man with no sign of inbreeding, only 100,000 years ago. The other camp believes in a continuous genetic change of fossil data across the globe, which seems to suggest that the human race has been advancing across the globe in a parallel multi-regional evolutionary process. If Eve’s descendants overtook the whole world, there would be a break in the type of fossils seen in the field. The older fossils would not relate to the newer fossils that descended from Eve, and there would be no way to explain the continuous change of fossil remains that are seen around the world using the Mitochondrial Eve data.\n\n(10). There seems to be no way for all the data to presently fit together. As Kip Thorne from Australian National University mentioned: “The fossil evidence is really scrappy. There just isn’t enough of it.” However, it does not look like the situation will change anytime soon, and Wolpoff thinks that the controversy will continue until all involved are dead. The next generation, he says, will have to decide. Perhaps advancements in both fields will someday decide the truth about the history of our race."

      "title": "Passage 3",
      "text": "(1). In 1987, a worldwide survey of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was published by Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson in Nature Magazine. The survey’s point was that “all mtDNAs stem from one woman” and that she probably lived in Africa around 200,000 years ago. When the media found out from Wilson (one of the authors of the paper) that “Mitochondrial Eve” or “African Eve” had been found, the story became a sensation. Had scientists found “the mother of us all”?\n\n(2). Most people know about the nuclei of cells and that genetic information from both parents is found in the nucleus. Humans have 46 chromosomes which they inherit from both their parents. DNA from both a mother and father are recombined, which allows the resulting children to inherit traits from both parents.\n\n(3). However, there is also DNA located in other parts of the cell. In the cytoplasm, organelles called “mitochondria”, which work to provide energy for the cell through ATP, also have DNA. This DNA, however, does not appear to come from both parents. Instead, it comes only from the mother. Thus, our mtDNA is, in essence, identical to that of our mothers. MtDNA is transferred from mother to daughter, generation after generation. The mtDNA that a son gets from his mother represents a dead-end street, since his mtDNA will not be used in his children.\n\n(4). After the initial discovery of the “Mitochondrial Eve,” Wilson felt uneasy about using the name “Eve” because it caused many to assume that Eve was the only woman alive during her time, much like what is written in Genesis of the Bible about Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Additionally, the usual evolutionary timescale attributed to man was incompatible with the short time frame of 200,000 years. Instead, it is believed that man has been around for a much longer period. For instance, “Java man” is thought to be 800,000 years old. Homo erectus specimens are found throughout the world, and over forty specimens of Asian Homo erectus discovered in China have been dated 220,000 to 500,000 years of age. “Lucy” is the name given to the remains of one such early specimen, thought to be one of the first to stand upright; it is predicted that she is at least one million years of age.\n\n(5). Furthermore, the story of Mitochondrial Eve is not what paleoanthropologists wanted to hear. Paleoanthropologists believed that man came from Africa, but they assumed it happened one million years ago. If Eve had lived a million years ago, most paleoanthropologists would have accepted the idea with open arms because this would mean that the Mitochondrial Eve data match the existing data that they (the paleoanthropologists) already had. It now seemed that several waves of humans left Africa and that each wave seemed to have taken over the world. Eve must have lived in Africa 200,000 years ago, with her descendants migrating from the continent approximately 100,000 years ago to take over the earth, after which all previous types of man vanished from the planet without leaving a trace in our genetic record! In addition, there is no evidence from the mtDNA data to suggest that Eve’s descendants interbred with the older man types at all.\n\n(6). Such an overtaking of the world’s population on the part of Eve’s descendants in the last wave of migration - a mere 100,000 years ago - was a point of contention, mainly because many paleoanthropologists saw a continuity of genetic traits between Homo erectus and modern man. A continuity of genetic traits in fossil remains suggests that Homo erectus has a direct genetic link to the more modern form of man, which means that the modern Chinese would be the descendants of the Chinese Erectus. Paleoanthropologists see this continuity as happening in separate parts of the world at the same time, in a parallel evolutionary process - what they see in the field is: African Erectus evolving into modern Africans, Chinese Erectus evolving into modern Chinese, European Erectus evolving into Neanderthals and then modern Europeans, and so forth. The features of modern Europeans, including a prominent nose and the shape of the rear end of their cranium, are closer in appearance to classic Neanderthals than are the features of any other living human population.\n\n(7). It is easy to tell feelings were running high regarding the fight between the “out-of-Africa” theory and the “multi-regional continuity” theory, which stipulates that modern man arose from various places on the earth at the same time.

      "text": "(1). In 1987, a worldwide survey of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was published by Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson in Nature Magazine. The survey’s point was that “all mtDNAs stem from one woman” and that she probably lived in Africa around 200,000 years ago. When the media found out from Wilson (one of the authors of the paper) that “Mitochondrial Eve” or “African Eve” had been found, the story became a sensation. Had scientists found “the mother of us all”?\n\n(2). Most people know about the nuclei of cells and that genetic information from both parents is found in the nucleus. Humans have 46 chromosomes which they inherit from both their parents. DNA from both a mother and father are recombined, which allows the resulting children to inherit traits from both parents.\n\n(3). However, there is also DNA located in other parts of the cell. In the cytoplasm, organelles called “mitochondria”, which work to provide energy for the cell through ATP, also have DNA. This DNA, however, does not appear to come from both parents. Instead, it comes only from the mother. Thus, our mtDNA is, in essence, identical to that of our mothers. MtDNA is transferred from mother to daughter, generation after generation. The mtDNA that a son gets from his mother represents a dead-end street, since his mtDNA will not be used in his children.\n\n(4). After the initial discovery of the “Mitochondrial Eve,” Wilson felt uneasy about using the name “Eve” because it caused many to assume that Eve was the only woman alive during her time, much like what is written in Genesis of the Bible about Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Additionally, the usual evolutionary timescale attributed to man was incompatible with the short time frame of 200,000 years. Instead, it is believed that man has been around for a much longer period. For instance, “Java man” is thought to be 800,000 years old. Homo erectus specimens are found throughout the world, and over forty specimens of Asian Homo erectus discovered in China have been dated 220,000 to 500,000 years of age. “Lucy” is the name given to the remains of one such early specimen, thought to be one of the first to stand upright; it is predicted that she is at least one million years of age.\n\n(5). Furthermore, the story of Mitochondrial Eve is not what paleoanthropologists wanted to hear. Paleoanthropologists believed that man came from Africa, but they assumed it happened one million years ago. If Eve had lived a million years ago, most paleoanthropologists would have accepted the idea with open arms because this would mean that the Mitochondrial Eve data match the existing data that they (the paleoanthropologists) already had. It now seemed that several waves of humans left Africa and that each wave seemed to have taken over the world. Eve must have lived in Africa 200,000 years ago, with her descendants migrating from the continent approximately 100,000 years ago to take over the earth, after which all previous types of man vanished from the planet without leaving a trace in our genetic record! In addition, there is no evidence from the mtDNA data to suggest that Eve’s descendants interbred with the older man types at all.\n\n(6). Such an overtaking of the world’s population on the part of Eve’s descendants in the last wave of migration - a mere 100,000 years ago - was a point of contention, mainly because many paleoanthropologists saw a continuity of genetic traits between Homo erectus and modern man. A continuity of genetic traits in fossil remains suggests that Homo erectus has a direct genetic link to the more modern form of man, which means that the modern Chinese would be the descendants of the Chinese Erectus. Paleoanthropologists see this continuity as happening in separate parts of the world at the same time, in a parallel evolutionary process - what they see in the field is: African Erectus evolving into modern Africans, Chinese Erectus evolving into modern Chinese, European Erectus evolving into Neanderthals and then modern Europeans, and so forth. The features of modern Europeans, including a prominent nose and the shape of the rear end of their cranium, are closer in appearance to classic Neanderthals than are the features of any other living human population.\n\n(7). It is easy to tell feelings were running high regarding the fight between the “out-of-Africa” theory and the “multi-regional continuity” theory, which stipulates that modern man arose from various places on the earth at the same time. The critics of the Eve story, who saw that the mitochondrial data did not fit with fossils in the field showing a multi-regional continuity, began to voice several complaints against the mitochondrial data. These complaints were as follows: the mitochondrial data were determined using restriction analysis rather than DNA sequencing; restriction analysis is an enzymatic method that can give false results at times; they used African Americans rather than Africans from Africa to represent native Africans in their study and, as a result, did not get a proper sampling of the African population; they used inferior methods to build a phylogenetic tree; they used a program called PAUP which was written with the intent of determining evolutionary relationships - the program gave different results when you entered the data in a different order, and the answer given was dependent upon the order that the data was entered into the computer.\n\n(8). The Mitochondrial Eve hypothesis was in deep trouble until Harvard’s Maryellen Ruvolo presented new data that used DNA sequencing rather than restriction analysis to study a part of the cytochrome oxidase gene found in the mitochondrial genome. The original work was criticized because it was based on a rapidly evolving portion of the mitochondria, but Ruvolo’s work was based on a slow-evolving portion of the mitochondrial genome, and she got the same answer as is found in the original work. The “multi-regional continuity” supporters were hoping for an older date, such as one million years. This date would have allowed the mitochondrial Eve data to fit within their accepted theory; however, that did not happen.\n\n(9). Currently, the battle is still raging over the history of Modern Human Origins, and we still have the same two irreconcilable scientific camps with data that do not fit together. One camp believes the mitochondrial Eve data and supports the “out-of-Africa” theory, where Eve’s descendants, upon leaving Africa, are seen as taking over the whole world and overcoming all the other types of man with no sign of inbreeding, only 100,000 years ago. The other camp believes in a continuous genetic change of fossil data across the globe, which seems to suggest that the human race has been advancing across the globe in a parallel multi-regional evolutionary process. If Eve’s descendants overtook the whole world, there would be a break in the type of fossils seen in the field. The older fossils would not relate to the newer fossils that descended from Eve, and there would be no way to explain the continuous change of fossil remains that are seen around the world using the Mitochondrial Eve data.\n\n(10). There seems to be no way for all the data to presently fit together. As Kip Thorne from Australian National University mentioned: “The fossil evidence is really scrappy. There just isn’t enough of it.” However, it does not look like the situation will change anytime soon, and Wolpoff thinks that the controversy will continue until all involved are dead. The next generation, he says, will have to decide. Perhaps advancements in both fields will someday decide the truth about the history of our race."

      "title": "Passage 3",
      "text": "(1). In 1987, a worldwide survey of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was published by Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson in Nature Magazine. The survey’s point was that “all mtDNAs stem from one woman” and that she probably lived in Africa around 200,000 years ago. When the media found out from Wilson (one of the authors of the paper) that “Mitochondrial Eve” or “African Eve” had been found, the story became a sensation. Had scientists found “the mother of us all”?\n\n(2). Most people know about the nuclei of cells and that genetic information from both parents is found in the nucleus. Humans have 46 chromosomes which they inherit from both their parents. DNA from both a mother and father are recombined, which allows the resulting children to inherit traits from both parents.\n\n(3). However, there is also DNA located in other parts of the cell. In the cytoplasm, organelles called “mitochondria”, which work to provide energy for the cell through ATP, also have DNA. This DNA, however, does not appear to come from both parents. Instead, it comes only from the mother. Thus, our mtDNA is, in essence, identical to that of our mothers. MtDNA is transferred from mother to daughter, generation after generation. The mtDNA that a son gets from his mother represents a dead-end street, since his mtDNA will not be used in his children.\n\n(4). After the initial discovery of the “Mitochondrial Eve,” Wilson felt uneasy about using the name “Eve” because it caused many to assume that Eve was the only woman alive during her time, much like what is written in Genesis of the Bible about Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Additionally, the usual evolutionary timescale attributed to man was incompatible with the short time frame of 200,000 years. Instead, it is believed that man has been around for a much longer period. For instance, “Java man” is thought to be 800,000 years old. Homo erectus specimens are found throughout the world, and over forty specimens of Asian Homo erectus discovered in China have been dated 220,000 to 500,000 years of age. “Lucy” is the name given to the remains of one such early specimen, thought to be one of the first to stand upright; it is predicted that she is at least one million years of age.\n\n(5). Furthermore, the story of Mitochondrial Eve is not what paleoanthropologists wanted to hear. Paleoanthropologists believed that man came from Africa, but they assumed it happened one million years ago. If Eve had lived a million years ago, most paleoanthropologists would have accepted the idea with open arms because this would mean that the Mitochondrial Eve data match the existing data that they (the paleoanthropologists) already had. It now seemed that several waves of humans left Africa and that each wave seemed to have taken over the world. Eve must have lived in Africa 200,000 years ago, with her descendants migrating from the continent approximately 100,000 years ago to take over the earth, after which all previous types of man vanished from the planet without leaving a trace in our genetic record! In addition, there is no evidence from the mtDNA data to suggest that Eve’s descendants interbred with the older man types at all.\n\n(6). Such an overtaking of the world’s population on the part of Eve’s descendants in the last wave of migration - a mere 100,000 years ago - was a point of contention, mainly because many paleoanthropologists saw a continuity of genetic traits between Homo erectus and modern man. A continuity of genetic traits in fossil remains suggests that Homo erectus has a direct genetic link to the more modern form of man, which means that the modern Chinese would be the descendants of the Chinese Erectus. Paleoanthropologists see this continuity as happening in separate parts of the world at the same time, in a parallel evolutionary process - what they see in the field is: African Erectus evolving into modern Africans, Chinese Erectus evolving into modern Chinese, European Erectus evolving into Neanderthals and then modern Europeans, and so forth. The features of modern Europeans, including a prominent nose and the shape of the rear end of their cranium, are closer in appearance to classic Neanderthals than are the features of any other living human population.\n\n(7). It is easy to tell feelings were running high regarding the fight between the “out-of-Africa” theory and the “multi-regional continuity” theory, which stipulates that modern man arose from various places on the earth at the same time. The critics of the Eve story, who saw that the mitochondrial data did not fit with fossils in the field showing a multi-regional continuity, began to voice several complaints against the mitochondrial data. These complaints were as follows: the mitochondrial data were determined using restriction analysis rather than DNA sequencing; restriction analysis is an enzymatic method that can give false results at times; they used African Americans rather than Africans from Africa to represent native Africans in their study and, as a result, did not get a proper sampling of the African population; they used inferior methods to build a phylogenetic tree; they used a program called PAUP which was written with the intent of determining evolutionary relationships - the program gave different results when you entered the data in a different order, and the answer given was dependent upon the order that the data was entered into the computer.\n\n(8). The Mitochondrial Eve hypothesis was in deep trouble until Harvard’s Maryellen Ruvolo presented new data that used DNA sequencing rather than restriction analysis to study a part of the cytochrome oxidase gene found in the mitochondrial genome. The original work was criticized because it was based on a rapidly evolving portion of the mitochondria, but Ruvolo’s work was based on a slow-evolving portion of the mitochondrial genome, and she got the same answer as is found in the original work. The “multi-regional continuity” supporters were hoping for an older date, such as one million years. This date would have allowed the mitochondrial Eve data to fit within their accepted theory; however, that did not happen.\n\n(9). Currently, the battle is still raging over the history of Modern Human Origins, and we still have the same two irreconcilable scientific camps with data that do not fit together. One camp believes the mitochondrial Eve data and supports the “out-of-Africa” theory, where Eve’s descendants, upon leaving Africa, are seen as taking over the whole world and overcoming all the other types of man with no sign of inbreeding, only 100,000 years ago. The other camp believes in a continuous genetic change of fossil data across the globe, which seems to suggest that the human race has been advancing across the globe in a parallel multi-regional evolutionary process. If Eve’s descendants overtook the whole world, there would be a break in the type of fossils seen in the field. The older fossils would not relate to the newer fossils that descended from Eve, and there would be no way to explain the continuous change of fossil remains that are seen around the world using the Mitochondrial Eve data.\n\n(10). There seems to be no way for all the data to presently fit together. As Kip Thorne from Australian National University mentioned: “The fossil evidence is really scrappy. There just isn’t enough of it.” However, it does not look like the situation will change anytime soon, and Wolpoff thinks that the controversy will continue until all involved are dead. The next generation, he says, will have to decide. Perhaps advancements in both fields will someday decide the truth about the history of our race."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, consider the fact that weaknesses in the original mitochondrial data are probably going to be pointed out by critics of the data. Therefore, to find out where the weaknesses in the data are listed, and thus which option choice is NOT a weakness, we should scan the passage for a paragraph focusing on the critics of the original mitochondrial data. Paragraph 7 reads: “Critics of the Eve story, who saw that the mitochondrial data did not fit with fossils in the field showing a multi-regional continuity, began to voice several complaints against the mitochondrial data. These complaints were as follows: the mitochondrial data were determined using restriction analysis rather than DNA sequencing; restriction analysis is an enzymatic method that can give false results at times; they used African Americans rather than Africans from Africa to represent native Africans in their study and, as a result, did not get a proper sampling of the African population; they used inferior methods to build a phylogenetic tree; they used a program called PAUP which was written with the intent of determining evolutionary relationships - the program gave different results when you entered the data in a different order, and the answer given was dependent upon the order that the data was entered into the computer.” Each of the weaknesses in the answer choices is listed EXCEPT “DNA sequencing was used” because the second sentence in the paragraph states that restriction analysis , rather than DNA sequencing, was used. This means that DNA sequencing was NOT used and thus was not a weakness in the original mitochondrial data. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. The order of the data determined the results – is incorrect because, in the passage, it states that scientists used a “program called PAUP… [which] gave different results when you entered the data in a different order.” As this was mentioned as a weakness of the original mitochondrial data, this is incorrect. Option C. The African population was misrepresented – is incorrect because, in the passage, it states that scientists “used African Americans rather than Africans from Africa to represent native Africans in their study. Thus, they did not get a proper sampling of the African population.” As this was mentioned as a weakness of the original mitochondrial data, this is incorrect. Option D. Inferior software was used – is incorrect because, in the passage, it states that scientists “used an inferior method to build a phylogenetic tree.” Since this was mentioned as a weakness of the original mitochondrial data, this is incorrect. Option E. The data was confirmed using substandard technology – is incorrect because, in the passage, it states that scientists “us[ed] restriction analysis rather than DNA sequencing. Restriction analysis is an enzymatic method that can give false results at times.” As this was mentioned as a weakness of the original mitochondrial data, this is incorrect.",
