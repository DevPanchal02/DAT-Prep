      "text": "(1). Forensic dentistry or “ odontology ” is a field that blends dentistry and forensic science. It is concerned with evaluating, managing, and presenting dental evidence in legal proceedings in the interest of justice. One of the main objectives of forensic dentistry is to identify missing or unidentified individuals, human remains, victims of natural disasters, or fatal accidental events - to this end, comparisons of unidentified dentition and its supporting structures with established dental records is performed. Records may be accessed from several places, such as private dental offices, military dental databases, prisons, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation via its National Crime Information Center’s Missing, Unidentified, and Wanted Persons files in a Web environment.\n\n(2). Due to its multidisciplinary nature, contributions from anthropology, criminology, toxicology, pathology, and law are integral to forensic dental casework. Identification of remains via dental evidence is plausible because of the preservation of hard tissues even after death, and their ability to withstand extremely high temperatures , such as 1600°C without a significant loss in the microstructure. Evidence is primarily derived from four main areas : dental structures (jaws and teeth), age of dentition, dental DNA, and bite marks.\n\n(3). Anthropologists contribute to forensic dental casework by examining teeth to ascertain sex, age, and ancestry on the basis of structure, shape, and features of specific teeth. Criminologists have the ability to analyze bite marks found at crime scenes, while toxicologists play an important role because teeth and the tissues surrounding teeth often preserve substances such as drugs and heavy metals , which may help in determining a decedent’s cause of death. Toxicologists can also study teeth to determine an unknown individual’s birthplace using chemical isotope analysis. Pathologists contribute to the field on the basis of their ability to evaluate dental trauma, which may point to a manner of death. Furthermore, pathologists study postmortem changes in dental tissue to establish how long an individual has been dead. Finally, the legal system ensures that dental evidence is handled appropriately and ethically and also oversees the admissibility of such evidence in the courts.\n\n(4). Individual dentition is naturally dynamic ; its changes are visible throughout life as it undergoes the deciduous phase , which involves the exfoliation of primary dentition and the subsequent eruption of permanent dentition . The fluid nature of dentition presents unique challenges to odontologists, difficulties not encountered when examining static evidence markers, such as fingerprints and footprints. Furthermore, the possibility of dental and periodontal diseases, oral manifestations of systemic diseases, as well as restoration, replacement, and reconstructive oral procedures impact can alter dental structures. Despite the potential for an ever-changing dentition, an inspection of dental structures has remained a legally accepted method of forensic identification. Historically, significant cases that were resolved by examining dental evidence include the identification of Revolutionary War hero Dr. Joseph Warren , the infamous Boston murder victim Dr. George Parkman, and the notorious German dictator Adolph Hitler.\n\n(5). Proper documentation is highly valuable in forensic dentistry, due to the investigative nature of its casework - therefore, it is paramount for dentists to record the presence of all dental anomalies, restorations, missing teeth, and any other noteworthy features in written, photographic, and radiographic forms. A forensic dental comparison between antemortem and post-mortem dental records requires that each provide maximum dental information for analysis without compromising accuracy. Dental identification can be classified into four types, as established by the American Board of Forensic Odontology: (1) Positive identification : A match is established between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data confirming it is from the same individual; (2) Possible identification : Few consistent features are noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data, but identity cannot be established because of the quality of records; (3) Insufficient evidence : Inadequate data to form a conclusion; (4) Exclusion : Apparent inconsistencies noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data.\n\n(6). Assessing the age of dentition is significant in forensic dental evaluation of living individuals or human remains. Racial and sex differences in tooth developmental patterns exist and have been acknowledged; however, dentition age can still be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Chronological age assessment can be employed concomitantly with an evaluation of osseous tissue developmental stage to gain estimation for an individual under 20 years of age. Several dental age estimation procedures are available and while some predict age using radiographic changes associated with the development of dentition in children, others employ dental radiographs to estimate dental chronological age in adults, living or deceased. In 1950 , Gustafson first identified and classified six characteristics to estimate dentition age in an adult. These variables were based on his observation of ground sections of extracted teeth; they include attrition of the occlusal or incisal surfaces, deposition of apical cementum, degree of deposition of secondary dentin, attachment level of the periodontium, root resorption, and radicular translucency .\n\n(7). Certain dental tissues in living and deceased subjects can be dated biochemically by assessing the ratios of levorotatory and dextrorotatory isomers of the amino acid aspartate. The L form of aspartic acid gradually transforms into its D stereoisomer through racemization. As enamel and dentin age, levels of D aspartic acid rise in calcified dental structures. As such, this quantitative change can be detected and compared to known records.\n\n(8). Individual genetic information is packaged within nuclear and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cells - while nuclear DNA can be transmitted via either parental route, mitochondrial DNA is transmitted via the matrilineal line. DNA is extracted from tissues or bodily fluids that are collected for forensic analysis. Everyone has a characteristic “DNA fingerprint,” which allows a given forensic scientist to positively identify individuals. The two main types of DNA fingerprinting methods are restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the former being the most used in forensic analysis. However, the disadvantage of RFLP is that it requires large amounts of DNA (>100 ng). On the contrary, PCR can be employed even when only a small amount of DNA has been collected (<100 pg) or the DNA sample is fragmented. Thus, PCR is quite a robust technique because it amplifies the amount of DNA initially present, and it even allows a forensic scientist to analyze trace evidence obtained from blood , saliva, or fluid samples. Calcified and pulp tissues within teeth provide an odontologist with the most uncontaminated DNA samples; furthermore, dental pulp is a good source for determining blood groups. Due to the presence of ABO blood group antigens in soft and hard tissues, identifying the blood group of extremely decomposed remains is also made possible.\n\n(9). Sex of a decedent can be identified based on DNA analysis of the sex-linked amelogenin gene. In fact, sex determination is an important subdivision of forensic odontology, and it can greatly assist in the identification of subjects. Four methods allow odontologists to distinguish between the sexes : examining craniofacial morphology and dimension, tooth dimension, tooth morphology, and DNA analysis of sex chromosomes. One example that highlights sex differences in tooth morphology is that the distal accessory ridge of canines is more prominent in males than in females.\n\n(10). When the human or animal dentition contacts the surface of an object during the act of biting , a distinct pattern is likely imprinted upon that surface. This pattern can be assessed and compared to the dentition of those suspected to be involved in the forensic case. More particularly, the bite mark must have a certain class and individual characteristics that are consistent with an impression caused by dentition. Class characteristics include the size and shape of the bite mark - for instance, the dental arch size must be consistent with that of the alleged biter and the presence of a circular shape with two half arches (the maxilla and mandible) separated by a space (temporomandibular joint) must also be present. Since the maxilla has a greater arch length relative to the mandible, the pattern of the bite mark must mimic this asymmetry. Individual characteristics of a bite mark include hallmark patterns made by certain teeth; those associated with human dentition are as follows: maxillary central incisor—large rectangle; mandibular incisor and maxillary lateral incisor—small rectangle; cuspid—point or triangle; maxillary cuspid — figure eight pattern ; mandibular cuspid—point denoting the buccal cusp; molar—not commonly observed in human bite patterns.\n\n(11). Bite marks are known to change with the passage of time , especially if impressed upon living tissue. For instance, post-injury alterations such as bleeding, swelling, and discoloration can be observed in the tissue. If bite marks are discovered on a decedent, the patterns are photographed and then assessed with standardized techniques. Due to variations that exist in the arrangement, spacing, size, and shape of teeth and dental arches, no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition.\n\n(12). The reasons why no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition are similar to the reasons that a person’s individual dentition changes over their lifetime, as mentioned previously. Such reasons include genetics, environment, lifestyle, age, dental procedures performed, and medical or congenital conditions . Regarding genetics , an individual’s jaw size and tooth size, as well as the timeline of tooth development, are based on genetics, with each of the aforementioned factors contributing to the specific pattern of their dentition. Environmental factors impacting dentition include the level of nutrition one has access to during childhood, as well as injuries to the face or jaw at any point in life. Additionally, oral hygiene routines and diet can also individualize a person's dentition. Congenital disorders such as Down syndrome, teeth naturally degrading over time due to aging, and any modifications such as braces, implants, or extractions are also likely to make the dentition of a given individual unique."

For instance, post-injury alterations such as bleeding, swelling, and discoloration can be observed in the tissue. If bite marks are discovered on a decedent, the patterns are photographed and then assessed with standardized techniques. Due to variations that exist in the arrangement, spacing, size, and shape of teeth and dental arches, no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition.\n\n(12). The reasons why no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition are similar to the reasons that a person’s individual dentition changes over their lifetime, as mentioned previously. Such reasons include genetics, environment, lifestyle, age, dental procedures performed, and medical or congenital conditions . Regarding genetics , an individual’s jaw size and tooth size, as well as the timeline of tooth development, are based on genetics, with each of the aforementioned factors contributing to the specific pattern of their dentition. Environmental factors impacting dentition include the level of nutrition one has access to during childhood, as well as injuries to the face or jaw at any point in life. Additionally, oral hygiene routines and diet can also individualize a person's dentition. Congenital disorders such as Down syndrome, teeth naturally degrading over time due to aging, and any modifications such as braces, implants, or extractions are also likely to make the dentition of a given individual unique."

      "concept_text": "To answer this application question, we should search the passage for the topics mentioned in the answer choices. The third answer choice mentions tooth damage, which is discussed in paragraph 2. This tells us that teeth can withstand high temperatures SUCH as 1600°C, but not that this is the temperature at which damage begins to show. Thus, the author would disagree with the third option choice. Paragraph 2 reads: “Identification of remains via dental evidence is plausible because of the preservation of hard tissues even after death, and their ability to withstand extremely high temperatures, such as 1600°C without a significant loss in the microstructure . The fourth option choice mentions mitochondrial DNA, which is mentioned in paragraph 8. Based on this statement, the author says mitochondrial DNA is also genetic but passed on through only the matrilineal line. Thus, the author would disagree with the fourth option choice. Paragraph 8 reads: “…while nuclear DNA can be transmitted via either parental route, mitochondrial DNA is transmitted via the matrilineal line…” The first, second, and fifth answer choices cover basic information regarding forensic dentistry, which is covered in paragraphs 1 and 2: “Forensic dentistry or “odontology” is a field that blends dentistry and forensic science. It is concerned with evaluating, managing, and presenting dental evidence in legal proceedings in the interest of justice. One of the main objectives of forensic dentistry is to identify missing or unidentified individuals, human remains, victims of natural disasters, or fatal accidental events…due to its multidisciplinary nature, contributions from anthropology, criminology, toxicology, pathology, and law are integral to forensic dental casework.” The government is not mentioned above, and passages 1 and 2 do not imply that forensic dentistry is futile; on the contrary, they outline its numerous uses. Thus, the author would disagree with the first and second option choices. Paragraphs 1 and 2 do suggest that the widespread integration, reach, and impact of odontology makes it an asset in forensics. Therefore, Option E is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Forensic dentistry is an important and integrative component of the government – is incorrect because, while true that forensic dentistry is cited as important and an integrative field, the passage doesn’t mention that it is a component of the government. Option B. Forensic dentistry is a futile practice based on the dynamic nature of teeth – is incorrect because, in paragraph 1, the author says: “One of the main objectives of forensic dentistry is to identify missing or unidentified individuals, human remains, victims of natural disasters, or fatal accidental events.” This shows that odontology tackles urgent and impactful problems, and thus is not futile. Option C. Teeth begin showing damage shortly after exposure to temperatures of 1600°C – is incorrect because in paragraph 2, the author says: “Identification of remains via dental evidence is plausible because of the preservation of hard tissues even after death, and their ability to withstand extremely high temperatures, such as 1600°C without a significant loss in microstructure.” Since teeth can withstand such high temperatures, we cannot assume that they will begin showing damage shortly after 1600°C; we only know that 1600°C is an example.

      "text": "(1). Forensic dentistry or “ odontology ” is a field that blends dentistry and forensic science. It is concerned with evaluating, managing, and presenting dental evidence in legal proceedings in the interest of justice. One of the main objectives of forensic dentistry is to identify missing or unidentified individuals, human remains, victims of natural disasters, or fatal accidental events - to this end, comparisons of unidentified dentition and its supporting structures with established dental records is performed. Records may be accessed from several places, such as private dental offices, military dental databases, prisons, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation via its National Crime Information Center’s Missing, Unidentified, and Wanted Persons files in a Web environment.\n\n(2). Due to its multidisciplinary nature, contributions from anthropology, criminology, toxicology, pathology, and law are integral to forensic dental casework. Identification of remains via dental evidence is plausible because of the preservation of hard tissues even after death, and their ability to withstand extremely high temperatures , such as 1600°C without a significant loss in the microstructure. Evidence is primarily derived from four main areas : dental structures (jaws and teeth), age of dentition, dental DNA, and bite marks.\n\n(3). Anthropologists contribute to forensic dental casework by examining teeth to ascertain sex, age, and ancestry on the basis of structure, shape, and features of specific teeth. Criminologists have the ability to analyze bite marks found at crime scenes, while toxicologists play an important role because teeth and the tissues surrounding teeth often preserve substances such as drugs and heavy metals , which may help in determining a decedent’s cause of death. Toxicologists can also study teeth to determine an unknown individual’s birthplace using chemical isotope analysis. Pathologists contribute to the field on the basis of their ability to evaluate dental trauma, which may point to a manner of death. Furthermore, pathologists study postmortem changes in dental tissue to establish how long an individual has been dead. Finally, the legal system ensures that dental evidence is handled appropriately and ethically and also oversees the admissibility of such evidence in the courts.\n\n(4). Individual dentition is naturally dynamic ; its changes are visible throughout life as it undergoes the deciduous phase , which involves the exfoliation of primary dentition and the subsequent eruption of permanent dentition . The fluid nature of dentition presents unique challenges to odontologists, difficulties not encountered when examining static evidence markers, such as fingerprints and footprints. Furthermore, the possibility of dental and periodontal diseases, oral manifestations of systemic diseases, as well as restoration, replacement, and reconstructive oral procedures impact can alter dental structures. Despite the potential for an ever-changing dentition, an inspection of dental structures has remained a legally accepted method of forensic identification. Historically, significant cases that were resolved by examining dental evidence include the identification of Revolutionary War hero Dr. Joseph Warren , the infamous Boston murder victim Dr. George Parkman, and the notorious German dictator Adolph Hitler.\n\n(5). Proper documentation is highly valuable in forensic dentistry, due to the investigative nature of its casework - therefore, it is paramount for dentists to record the presence of all dental anomalies, restorations, missing teeth, and any other noteworthy features in written, photographic, and radiographic forms. A forensic dental comparison between antemortem and post-mortem dental records requires that each provide maximum dental information for analysis without compromising accuracy. Dental identification can be classified into four types, as established by the American Board of Forensic Odontology: (1) Positive identification : A match is established between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data confirming it is from the same individual; (2) Possible identification : Few consistent features are noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data, but identity cannot be established because of the quality of records; (3) Insufficient evidence : Inadequate data to form a conclusion; (4) Exclusion : Apparent inconsistencies noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data.\n\n(6). Assessing the age of dentition is significant in forensic dental evaluation of living individuals or human remains. Racial and sex differences in tooth developmental patterns exist and have been acknowledged; however, dentition age can still be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Chronological age assessment can be employed concomitantly with an evaluation of osseous tissue developmental stage to gain estimation for an individual under 20 years of age. Several dental age estimation procedures are available and while some predict age using radiographic changes associated with the development of dentition in children, others employ dental radiographs to estimate dental chronological age in adults, living or deceased. In 1950 , Gustafson first identified and classified six characteristics to estimate dentition age in an adult. These variables were based on his observation of ground sections of extracted teeth; they include attrition of the occlusal or incisal surfaces, deposition of apical cementum, degree of deposition of secondary dentin, attachment level of the periodontium, root resorption, and radicular translucency .\n\n(7). Certain dental tissues in living and deceased subjects can be dated biochemically by assessing the ratios of levorotatory and dextrorotatory isomers of the amino acid aspartate. The L form of aspartic acid gradually transforms into its D stereoisomer through racemization. As enamel and dentin age, levels of D aspartic acid rise in calcified dental structures. As such, this quantitative change can be detected and compared to known records.\n\n(8). Individual genetic information is packaged within nuclear and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cells - while nuclear DNA can be transmitted via either parental route, mitochondrial DNA is transmitted via the matrilineal line. DNA is extracted from tissues or bodily fluids that are collected for forensic analysis. Everyone has a characteristic “DNA fingerprint,” which allows a given forensic scientist to positively identify individuals. The two main types of DNA fingerprinting methods are restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the former being the most used in forensic analysis. However, the disadvantage of RFLP is that it requires large amounts of DNA (>100 ng). On the contrary, PCR can be employed even when only a small amount of DNA has been collected (<100 pg) or the DNA sample is fragmented. Thus, PCR is quite a robust technique because it amplifies the amount of DNA initially present, and it even allows a forensic scientist to analyze trace evidence obtained from blood , saliva, or fluid samples. Calcified and pulp tissues within teeth provide an odontologist with the most uncontaminated DNA samples; furthermore, dental pulp is a good source for determining blood groups. Due to the presence of ABO blood group antigens in soft and hard tissues, identifying the blood group of extremely decomposed remains is also made possible.\n\n(9). Sex of a decedent can be identified based on DNA analysis of the sex-linked amelogenin gene. In fact, sex determination is an important subdivision of forensic odontology, and it can greatly assist in the identification of subjects. Four methods allow odontologists to distinguish between the sexes : examining craniofacial morphology and dimension, tooth dimension, tooth morphology, and DNA analysis of sex chromosomes. One example that highlights sex differences in tooth morphology is that the distal accessory ridge of canines is more prominent in males than in females.\n\n(10). When the human or animal dentition contacts the surface of an object during the act of biting , a distinct pattern is likely imprinted upon that surface. This pattern can be assessed and compared to the dentition of those suspected to be involved in the forensic case. More particularly, the bite mark must have a certain class and individual characteristics that are consistent with an impression caused by dentition. Class characteristics include the size and shape of the bite mark - for instance, the dental arch size must be consistent with that of the alleged biter and the presence of a circular shape with two half arches (the maxilla and mandible) separated by a space (temporomandibular joint) must also be present. Since the maxilla has a greater arch length relative to the mandible, the pattern of the bite mark must mimic this asymmetry. Individual characteristics of a bite mark include hallmark patterns made by certain teeth; those associated with human dentition are as follows: maxillary central incisor—large rectangle; mandibular incisor and maxillary lateral incisor—small rectangle; cuspid—point or triangle; maxillary cuspid — figure eight pattern ; mandibular cuspid—point denoting the buccal cusp; molar—not commonly observed in human bite patterns.\n\n(11). Bite marks are known to change with the passage of time , especially if impressed upon living tissue. For instance, post-injury alterations such as bleeding, swelling, and discoloration can be observed in the tissue. If bite marks are discovered on a decedent, the patterns are photographed and then assessed with standardized techniques. Due to variations that exist in the arrangement, spacing, size, and shape of teeth and dental arches, no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition.\n\n(12). The reasons why no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition are similar to the reasons that a person’s individual dentition changes over their lifetime, as mentioned previously. Such reasons include genetics, environment, lifestyle, age, dental procedures performed, and medical or congenital conditions .

      "text": "(1). Forensic dentistry or “ odontology ” is a field that blends dentistry and forensic science. It is concerned with evaluating, managing, and presenting dental evidence in legal proceedings in the interest of justice. One of the main objectives of forensic dentistry is to identify missing or unidentified individuals, human remains, victims of natural disasters, or fatal accidental events - to this end, comparisons of unidentified dentition and its supporting structures with established dental records is performed. Records may be accessed from several places, such as private dental offices, military dental databases, prisons, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation via its National Crime Information Center’s Missing, Unidentified, and Wanted Persons files in a Web environment.\n\n(2). Due to its multidisciplinary nature, contributions from anthropology, criminology, toxicology, pathology, and law are integral to forensic dental casework. Identification of remains via dental evidence is plausible because of the preservation of hard tissues even after death, and their ability to withstand extremely high temperatures , such as 1600°C without a significant loss in the microstructure. Evidence is primarily derived from four main areas : dental structures (jaws and teeth), age of dentition, dental DNA, and bite marks.\n\n(3). Anthropologists contribute to forensic dental casework by examining teeth to ascertain sex, age, and ancestry on the basis of structure, shape, and features of specific teeth. Criminologists have the ability to analyze bite marks found at crime scenes, while toxicologists play an important role because teeth and the tissues surrounding teeth often preserve substances such as drugs and heavy metals , which may help in determining a decedent’s cause of death. Toxicologists can also study teeth to determine an unknown individual’s birthplace using chemical isotope analysis. Pathologists contribute to the field on the basis of their ability to evaluate dental trauma, which may point to a manner of death. Furthermore, pathologists study postmortem changes in dental tissue to establish how long an individual has been dead. Finally, the legal system ensures that dental evidence is handled appropriately and ethically and also oversees the admissibility of such evidence in the courts.\n\n(4). Individual dentition is naturally dynamic ; its changes are visible throughout life as it undergoes the deciduous phase , which involves the exfoliation of primary dentition and the subsequent eruption of permanent dentition . The fluid nature of dentition presents unique challenges to odontologists, difficulties not encountered when examining static evidence markers, such as fingerprints and footprints. Furthermore, the possibility of dental and periodontal diseases, oral manifestations of systemic diseases, as well as restoration, replacement, and reconstructive oral procedures impact can alter dental structures. Despite the potential for an ever-changing dentition, an inspection of dental structures has remained a legally accepted method of forensic identification. Historically, significant cases that were resolved by examining dental evidence include the identification of Revolutionary War hero Dr. Joseph Warren , the infamous Boston murder victim Dr. George Parkman, and the notorious German dictator Adolph Hitler.\n\n(5). Proper documentation is highly valuable in forensic dentistry, due to the investigative nature of its casework - therefore, it is paramount for dentists to record the presence of all dental anomalies, restorations, missing teeth, and any other noteworthy features in written, photographic, and radiographic forms. A forensic dental comparison between antemortem and post-mortem dental records requires that each provide maximum dental information for analysis without compromising accuracy. Dental identification can be classified into four types, as established by the American Board of Forensic Odontology: (1) Positive identification : A match is established between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data confirming it is from the same individual; (2) Possible identification : Few consistent features are noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data, but identity cannot be established because of the quality of records; (3) Insufficient evidence : Inadequate data to form a conclusion; (4) Exclusion : Apparent inconsistencies noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data.\n\n(6). Assessing the age of dentition is significant in forensic dental evaluation of living individuals or human remains. Racial and sex differences in tooth developmental patterns exist and have been acknowledged; however, dentition age can still be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Chronological age assessment can be employed concomitantly with an evaluation of osseous tissue developmental stage to gain estimation for an individual under 20 years of age. Several dental age estimation procedures are available and while some predict age using radiographic changes associated with the development of dentition in children, others employ dental radiographs to estimate dental chronological age in adults, living or deceased. In 1950 , Gustafson first identified and classified six characteristics to estimate dentition age in an adult. These variables were based on his observation of ground sections of extracted teeth; they include attrition of the occlusal or incisal surfaces, deposition of apical cementum, degree of deposition of secondary dentin, attachment level of the periodontium, root resorption, and radicular translucency .\n\n(7). Certain dental tissues in living and deceased subjects can be dated biochemically by assessing the ratios of levorotatory and dextrorotatory isomers of the amino acid aspartate. The L form of aspartic acid gradually transforms into its D stereoisomer through racemization. As enamel and dentin age, levels of D aspartic acid rise in calcified dental structures. As such, this quantitative change can be detected and compared to known records.\n\n(8). Individual genetic information is packaged within nuclear and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cells - while nuclear DNA can be transmitted via either parental route, mitochondrial DNA is transmitted via the matrilineal line. DNA is extracted from tissues or bodily fluids that are collected for forensic analysis. Everyone has a characteristic “DNA fingerprint,” which allows a given forensic scientist to positively identify individuals. The two main types of DNA fingerprinting methods are restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the former being the most used in forensic analysis. However, the disadvantage of RFLP is that it requires large amounts of DNA (>100 ng). On the contrary, PCR can be employed even when only a small amount of DNA has been collected (<100 pg) or the DNA sample is fragmented. Thus, PCR is quite a robust technique because it amplifies the amount of DNA initially present, and it even allows a forensic scientist to analyze trace evidence obtained from blood , saliva, or fluid samples. Calcified and pulp tissues within teeth provide an odontologist with the most uncontaminated DNA samples; furthermore, dental pulp is a good source for determining blood groups. Due to the presence of ABO blood group antigens in soft and hard tissues, identifying the blood group of extremely decomposed remains is also made possible.\n\n(9). Sex of a decedent can be identified based on DNA analysis of the sex-linked amelogenin gene. In fact, sex determination is an important subdivision of forensic odontology, and it can greatly assist in the identification of subjects. Four methods allow odontologists to distinguish between the sexes : examining craniofacial morphology and dimension, tooth dimension, tooth morphology, and DNA analysis of sex chromosomes. One example that highlights sex differences in tooth morphology is that the distal accessory ridge of canines is more prominent in males than in females.\n\n(10). When the human or animal dentition contacts the surface of an object during the act of biting , a distinct pattern is likely imprinted upon that surface. This pattern can be assessed and compared to the dentition of those suspected to be involved in the forensic case. More particularly, the bite mark must have a certain class and individual characteristics that are consistent with an impression caused by dentition. Class characteristics include the size and shape of the bite mark - for instance, the dental arch size must be consistent with that of the alleged biter and the presence of a circular shape with two half arches (the maxilla and mandible) separated by a space (temporomandibular joint) must also be present. Since the maxilla has a greater arch length relative to the mandible, the pattern of the bite mark must mimic this asymmetry. Individual characteristics of a bite mark include hallmark patterns made by certain teeth; those associated with human dentition are as follows: maxillary central incisor—large rectangle; mandibular incisor and maxillary lateral incisor—small rectangle; cuspid—point or triangle; maxillary cuspid — figure eight pattern ; mandibular cuspid—point denoting the buccal cusp; molar—not commonly observed in human bite patterns.\n\n(11). Bite marks are known to change with the passage of time , especially if impressed upon living tissue. For instance, post-injury alterations such as bleeding, swelling, and discoloration can be observed in the tissue. If bite marks are discovered on a decedent, the patterns are photographed and then assessed with standardized techniques. Due to variations that exist in the arrangement, spacing, size, and shape of teeth and dental arches, no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition.\n\n(12). The reasons why no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition are similar to the reasons that a person’s individual dentition changes over their lifetime, as mentioned previously. Such reasons include genetics, environment, lifestyle, age, dental procedures performed, and medical or congenital conditions . Regarding genetics , an individual’s jaw size and tooth size, as well as the timeline of tooth development, are based on genetics, with each of the aforementioned factors contributing to the specific pattern of their dentition. Environmental factors impacting dentition include the level of nutrition one has access to during childhood, as well as injuries to the face or jaw at any point in life. Additionally, oral hygiene routines and diet can also individualize a person's dentition. Congenital disorders such as Down syndrome, teeth naturally degrading over time due to aging, and any modifications such as braces, implants, or extractions are also likely to make the dentition of a given individual unique."

Bite marks are known to change with the passage of time , especially if impressed upon living tissue. For instance, post-injury alterations such as bleeding, swelling, and discoloration can be observed in the tissue. If bite marks are discovered on a decedent, the patterns are photographed and then assessed with standardized techniques.

      "text": "(1). Forensic dentistry or “ odontology ” is a field that blends dentistry and forensic science. It is concerned with evaluating, managing, and presenting dental evidence in legal proceedings in the interest of justice. One of the main objectives of forensic dentistry is to identify missing or unidentified individuals, human remains, victims of natural disasters, or fatal accidental events - to this end, comparisons of unidentified dentition and its supporting structures with established dental records is performed. Records may be accessed from several places, such as private dental offices, military dental databases, prisons, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation via its National Crime Information Center’s Missing, Unidentified, and Wanted Persons files in a Web environment.\n\n(2). Due to its multidisciplinary nature, contributions from anthropology, criminology, toxicology, pathology, and law are integral to forensic dental casework. Identification of remains via dental evidence is plausible because of the preservation of hard tissues even after death, and their ability to withstand extremely high temperatures , such as 1600°C without a significant loss in the microstructure. Evidence is primarily derived from four main areas : dental structures (jaws and teeth), age of dentition, dental DNA, and bite marks.\n\n(3). Anthropologists contribute to forensic dental casework by examining teeth to ascertain sex, age, and ancestry on the basis of structure, shape, and features of specific teeth. Criminologists have the ability to analyze bite marks found at crime scenes, while toxicologists play an important role because teeth and the tissues surrounding teeth often preserve substances such as drugs and heavy metals , which may help in determining a decedent’s cause of death. Toxicologists can also study teeth to determine an unknown individual’s birthplace using chemical isotope analysis. Pathologists contribute to the field on the basis of their ability to evaluate dental trauma, which may point to a manner of death. Furthermore, pathologists study postmortem changes in dental tissue to establish how long an individual has been dead. Finally, the legal system ensures that dental evidence is handled appropriately and ethically and also oversees the admissibility of such evidence in the courts.\n\n(4). Individual dentition is naturally dynamic ; its changes are visible throughout life as it undergoes the deciduous phase , which involves the exfoliation of primary dentition and the subsequent eruption of permanent dentition . The fluid nature of dentition presents unique challenges to odontologists, difficulties not encountered when examining static evidence markers, such as fingerprints and footprints. Furthermore, the possibility of dental and periodontal diseases, oral manifestations of systemic diseases, as well as restoration, replacement, and reconstructive oral procedures impact can alter dental structures. Despite the potential for an ever-changing dentition, an inspection of dental structures has remained a legally accepted method of forensic identification. Historically, significant cases that were resolved by examining dental evidence include the identification of Revolutionary War hero Dr. Joseph Warren , the infamous Boston murder victim Dr. George Parkman, and the notorious German dictator Adolph Hitler.\n\n(5). Proper documentation is highly valuable in forensic dentistry, due to the investigative nature of its casework - therefore, it is paramount for dentists to record the presence of all dental anomalies, restorations, missing teeth, and any other noteworthy features in written, photographic, and radiographic forms. A forensic dental comparison between antemortem and post-mortem dental records requires that each provide maximum dental information for analysis without compromising accuracy. Dental identification can be classified into four types, as established by the American Board of Forensic Odontology: (1) Positive identification : A match is established between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data confirming it is from the same individual; (2) Possible identification : Few consistent features are noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data, but identity cannot be established because of the quality of records; (3) Insufficient evidence : Inadequate data to form a conclusion; (4) Exclusion : Apparent inconsistencies noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data.\n\n(6). Assessing the age of dentition is significant in forensic dental evaluation of living individuals or human remains. Racial and sex differences in tooth developmental patterns exist and have been acknowledged; however, dentition age can still be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Chronological age assessment can be employed concomitantly with an evaluation of osseous tissue developmental stage to gain estimation for an individual under 20 years of age. Several dental age estimation procedures are available and while some predict age using radiographic changes associated with the development of dentition in children, others employ dental radiographs to estimate dental chronological age in adults, living or deceased. In 1950 , Gustafson first identified and classified six characteristics to estimate dentition age in an adult. These variables were based on his observation of ground sections of extracted teeth; they include attrition of the occlusal or incisal surfaces, deposition of apical cementum, degree of deposition of secondary dentin, attachment level of the periodontium, root resorption, and radicular translucency .\n\n(7). Certain dental tissues in living and deceased subjects can be dated biochemically by assessing the ratios of levorotatory and dextrorotatory isomers of the amino acid aspartate. The L form of aspartic acid gradually transforms into its D stereoisomer through racemization. As enamel and dentin age, levels of D aspartic acid rise in calcified dental structures. As such, this quantitative change can be detected and compared to known records.\n\n(8). Individual genetic information is packaged within nuclear and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cells - while nuclear DNA can be transmitted via either parental route, mitochondrial DNA is transmitted via the matrilineal line. DNA is extracted from tissues or bodily fluids that are collected for forensic analysis. Everyone has a characteristic “DNA fingerprint,” which allows a given forensic scientist to positively identify individuals. The two main types of DNA fingerprinting methods are restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the former being the most used in forensic analysis. However, the disadvantage of RFLP is that it requires large amounts of DNA (>100 ng). On the contrary, PCR can be employed even when only a small amount of DNA has been collected (<100 pg) or the DNA sample is fragmented. Thus, PCR is quite a robust technique because it amplifies the amount of DNA initially present, and it even allows a forensic scientist to analyze trace evidence obtained from blood , saliva, or fluid samples. Calcified and pulp tissues within teeth provide an odontologist with the most uncontaminated DNA samples; furthermore, dental pulp is a good source for determining blood groups. Due to the presence of ABO blood group antigens in soft and hard tissues, identifying the blood group of extremely decomposed remains is also made possible.\n\n(9). Sex of a decedent can be identified based on DNA analysis of the sex-linked amelogenin gene. In fact, sex determination is an important subdivision of forensic odontology, and it can greatly assist in the identification of subjects. Four methods allow odontologists to distinguish between the sexes : examining craniofacial morphology and dimension, tooth dimension, tooth morphology, and DNA analysis of sex chromosomes. One example that highlights sex differences in tooth morphology is that the distal accessory ridge of canines is more prominent in males than in females.\n\n(10). When the human or animal dentition contacts the surface of an object during the act of biting , a distinct pattern is likely imprinted upon that surface. This pattern can be assessed and compared to the dentition of those suspected to be involved in the forensic case. More particularly, the bite mark must have a certain class and individual characteristics that are consistent with an impression caused by dentition. Class characteristics include the size and shape of the bite mark - for instance, the dental arch size must be consistent with that of the alleged biter and the presence of a circular shape with two half arches (the maxilla and mandible) separated by a space (temporomandibular joint) must also be present. Since the maxilla has a greater arch length relative to the mandible, the pattern of the bite mark must mimic this asymmetry. Individual characteristics of a bite mark include hallmark patterns made by certain teeth; those associated with human dentition are as follows: maxillary central incisor—large rectangle; mandibular incisor and maxillary lateral incisor—small rectangle; cuspid—point or triangle; maxillary cuspid — figure eight pattern ; mandibular cuspid—point denoting the buccal cusp; molar—not commonly observed in human bite patterns.\n\n(11). Bite marks are known to change with the passage of time , especially if impressed upon living tissue. For instance, post-injury alterations such as bleeding, swelling, and discoloration can be observed in the tissue. If bite marks are discovered on a decedent, the patterns are photographed and then assessed with standardized techniques. Due to variations that exist in the arrangement, spacing, size, and shape of teeth and dental arches, no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition.\n\n(12). The reasons why no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition are similar to the reasons that a person’s individual dentition changes over their lifetime, as mentioned previously. Such reasons include genetics, environment, lifestyle, age, dental procedures performed, and medical or congenital conditions . Regarding genetics , an individual’s jaw size and tooth size, as well as the timeline of tooth development, are based on genetics, with each of the aforementioned factors contributing to the specific pattern of their dentition. Environmental factors impacting dentition include the level of nutrition one has access to during childhood, as well as injuries to the face or jaw at any point in life. Additionally, oral hygiene routines and diet can also individualize a person's dentition. Congenital disorders such as Down syndrome, teeth naturally degrading over time due to aging, and any modifications such as braces, implants, or extractions are also likely to make the dentition of a given individual unique."

A forensic dental comparison between antemortem and post-mortem dental records requires that each provide maximum dental information for analysis without compromising accuracy. Dental identification can be classified into four types, as established by the American Board of Forensic Odontology: (1) Positive identification : A match is established between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data confirming it is from the same individual; (2) Possible identification : Few consistent features are noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data, but identity cannot be established because of the quality of records; (3) Insufficient evidence : Inadequate data to form a conclusion; (4) Exclusion : Apparent inconsistencies noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data.\n\n(6).

Chronological age assessment can be employed concomitantly with an evaluation of osseous tissue developmental stage to gain estimation for an individual under 20 years of age. Several dental age estimation procedures are available and while some predict age using radiographic changes associated with the development of dentition in children, others employ dental radiographs to estimate dental chronological age in adults, living or deceased. In 1950 , Gustafson first identified and classified six characteristics to estimate dentition age in an adult.

Certain dental tissues in living and deceased subjects can be dated biochemically by assessing the ratios of levorotatory and dextrorotatory isomers of the amino acid aspartate. The L form of aspartic acid gradually transforms into its D stereoisomer through racemization. As enamel and dentin age, levels of D aspartic acid rise in calcified dental structures. As such, this quantitative change can be detected and compared to known records.\n\n(8). Individual genetic information is packaged within nuclear and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cells - while nuclear DNA can be transmitted via either parental route, mitochondrial DNA is transmitted via the matrilineal line. DNA is extracted from tissues or bodily fluids that are collected for forensic analysis. Everyone has a characteristic “DNA fingerprint,” which allows a given forensic scientist to positively identify individuals. The two main types of DNA fingerprinting methods are restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the former being the most used in forensic analysis. However, the disadvantage of RFLP is that it requires large amounts of DNA (>100 ng). On the contrary, PCR can be employed even when only a small amount of DNA has been collected (<100 pg) or the DNA sample is fragmented. Thus, PCR is quite a robust technique because it amplifies the amount of DNA initially present, and it even allows a forensic scientist to analyze trace evidence obtained from blood , saliva, or fluid samples. Calcified and pulp tissues within teeth provide an odontologist with the most uncontaminated DNA samples; furthermore, dental pulp is a good source for determining blood groups. Due to the presence of ABO blood group antigens in soft and hard tissues, identifying the blood group of extremely decomposed remains is also made possible.\n\n(9). Sex of a decedent can be identified based on DNA analysis of the sex-linked amelogenin gene. In fact, sex determination is an important subdivision of forensic odontology, and it can greatly assist in the identification of subjects. Four methods allow odontologists to distinguish between the sexes : examining craniofacial morphology and dimension, tooth dimension, tooth morphology, and DNA analysis of sex chromosomes. One example that highlights sex differences in tooth morphology is that the distal accessory ridge of canines is more prominent in males than in females.\n\n(10). When the human or animal dentition contacts the surface of an object during the act of biting , a distinct pattern is likely imprinted upon that surface. This pattern can be assessed and compared to the dentition of those suspected to be involved in the forensic case. More particularly, the bite mark must have a certain class and individual characteristics that are consistent with an impression caused by dentition. Class characteristics include the size and shape of the bite mark - for instance, the dental arch size must be consistent with that of the alleged biter and the presence of a circular shape with two half arches (the maxilla and mandible) separated by a space (temporomandibular joint) must also be present. Since the maxilla has a greater arch length relative to the mandible, the pattern of the bite mark must mimic this asymmetry. Individual characteristics of a bite mark include hallmark patterns made by certain teeth; those associated with human dentition are as follows: maxillary central incisor—large rectangle; mandibular incisor and maxillary lateral incisor—small rectangle; cuspid—point or triangle; maxillary cuspid — figure eight pattern ; mandibular cuspid—point denoting the buccal cusp; molar—not commonly observed in human bite patterns.\n\n(11). Bite marks are known to change with the passage of time , especially if impressed upon living tissue. For instance, post-injury alterations such as bleeding, swelling, and discoloration can be observed in the tissue. If bite marks are discovered on a decedent, the patterns are photographed and then assessed with standardized techniques. Due to variations that exist in the arrangement, spacing, size, and shape of teeth and dental arches, no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition.\n\n(12). The reasons why no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition are similar to the reasons that a person’s individual dentition changes over their lifetime, as mentioned previously.

      "text": "(1). Forensic dentistry or “ odontology ” is a field that blends dentistry and forensic science. It is concerned with evaluating, managing, and presenting dental evidence in legal proceedings in the interest of justice. One of the main objectives of forensic dentistry is to identify missing or unidentified individuals, human remains, victims of natural disasters, or fatal accidental events - to this end, comparisons of unidentified dentition and its supporting structures with established dental records is performed. Records may be accessed from several places, such as private dental offices, military dental databases, prisons, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation via its National Crime Information Center’s Missing, Unidentified, and Wanted Persons files in a Web environment.\n\n(2). Due to its multidisciplinary nature, contributions from anthropology, criminology, toxicology, pathology, and law are integral to forensic dental casework. Identification of remains via dental evidence is plausible because of the preservation of hard tissues even after death, and their ability to withstand extremely high temperatures , such as 1600°C without a significant loss in the microstructure. Evidence is primarily derived from four main areas : dental structures (jaws and teeth), age of dentition, dental DNA, and bite marks.\n\n(3). Anthropologists contribute to forensic dental casework by examining teeth to ascertain sex, age, and ancestry on the basis of structure, shape, and features of specific teeth. Criminologists have the ability to analyze bite marks found at crime scenes, while toxicologists play an important role because teeth and the tissues surrounding teeth often preserve substances such as drugs and heavy metals , which may help in determining a decedent’s cause of death. Toxicologists can also study teeth to determine an unknown individual’s birthplace using chemical isotope analysis. Pathologists contribute to the field on the basis of their ability to evaluate dental trauma, which may point to a manner of death. Furthermore, pathologists study postmortem changes in dental tissue to establish how long an individual has been dead. Finally, the legal system ensures that dental evidence is handled appropriately and ethically and also oversees the admissibility of such evidence in the courts.\n\n(4). Individual dentition is naturally dynamic ; its changes are visible throughout life as it undergoes the deciduous phase , which involves the exfoliation of primary dentition and the subsequent eruption of permanent dentition .

Furthermore, the possibility of dental and periodontal diseases, oral manifestations of systemic diseases, as well as restoration, replacement, and reconstructive oral procedures impact can alter dental structures.

      "text": "(1). Forensic dentistry or “ odontology ” is a field that blends dentistry and forensic science. It is concerned with evaluating, managing, and presenting dental evidence in legal proceedings in the interest of justice. One of the main objectives of forensic dentistry is to identify missing or unidentified individuals, human remains, victims of natural disasters, or fatal accidental events - to this end, comparisons of unidentified dentition and its supporting structures with established dental records is performed. Records may be accessed from several places, such as private dental offices, military dental databases, prisons, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation via its National Crime Information Center’s Missing, Unidentified, and Wanted Persons files in a Web environment.\n\n(2). Due to its multidisciplinary nature, contributions from anthropology, criminology, toxicology, pathology, and law are integral to forensic dental casework. Identification of remains via dental evidence is plausible because of the preservation of hard tissues even after death, and their ability to withstand extremely high temperatures , such as 1600°C without a significant loss in the microstructure. Evidence is primarily derived from four main areas : dental structures (jaws and teeth), age of dentition, dental DNA, and bite marks.\n\n(3). Anthropologists contribute to forensic dental casework by examining teeth to ascertain sex, age, and ancestry on the basis of structure, shape, and features of specific teeth. Criminologists have the ability to analyze bite marks found at crime scenes, while toxicologists play an important role because teeth and the tissues surrounding teeth often preserve substances such as drugs and heavy metals , which may help in determining a decedent’s cause of death. Toxicologists can also study teeth to determine an unknown individual’s birthplace using chemical isotope analysis. Pathologists contribute to the field on the basis of their ability to evaluate dental trauma, which may point to a manner of death. Furthermore, pathologists study postmortem changes in dental tissue to establish how long an individual has been dead. Finally, the legal system ensures that dental evidence is handled appropriately and ethically and also oversees the admissibility of such evidence in the courts.\n\n(4). Individual dentition is naturally dynamic ; its changes are visible throughout life as it undergoes the deciduous phase , which involves the exfoliation of primary dentition and the subsequent eruption of permanent dentition . The fluid nature of dentition presents unique challenges to odontologists, difficulties not encountered when examining static evidence markers, such as fingerprints and footprints. Furthermore, the possibility of dental and periodontal diseases, oral manifestations of systemic diseases, as well as restoration, replacement, and reconstructive oral procedures impact can alter dental structures. Despite the potential for an ever-changing dentition, an inspection of dental structures has remained a legally accepted method of forensic identification. Historically, significant cases that were resolved by examining dental evidence include the identification of Revolutionary War hero Dr. Joseph Warren , the infamous Boston murder victim Dr. George Parkman, and the notorious German dictator Adolph Hitler.\n\n(5). Proper documentation is highly valuable in forensic dentistry, due to the investigative nature of its casework - therefore, it is paramount for dentists to record the presence of all dental anomalies, restorations, missing teeth, and any other noteworthy features in written, photographic, and radiographic forms. A forensic dental comparison between antemortem and post-mortem dental records requires that each provide maximum dental information for analysis without compromising accuracy. Dental identification can be classified into four types, as established by the American Board of Forensic Odontology: (1) Positive identification : A match is established between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data confirming it is from the same individual; (2) Possible identification : Few consistent features are noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data, but identity cannot be established because of the quality of records; (3) Insufficient evidence : Inadequate data to form a conclusion; (4) Exclusion : Apparent inconsistencies noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data.\n\n(6). Assessing the age of dentition is significant in forensic dental evaluation of living individuals or human remains. Racial and sex differences in tooth developmental patterns exist and have been acknowledged; however, dentition age can still be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Chronological age assessment can be employed concomitantly with an evaluation of osseous tissue developmental stage to gain estimation for an individual under 20 years of age. Several dental age estimation procedures are available and while some predict age using radiographic changes associated with the development of dentition in children, others employ dental radiographs to estimate dental chronological age in adults, living or deceased. In 1950 , Gustafson first identified and classified six characteristics to estimate dentition age in an adult. These variables were based on his observation of ground sections of extracted teeth; they include attrition of the occlusal or incisal surfaces, deposition of apical cementum, degree of deposition of secondary dentin, attachment level of the periodontium, root resorption, and radicular translucency .\n\n(7). Certain dental tissues in living and deceased subjects can be dated biochemically by assessing the ratios of levorotatory and dextrorotatory isomers of the amino acid aspartate. The L form of aspartic acid gradually transforms into its D stereoisomer through racemization. As enamel and dentin age, levels of D aspartic acid rise in calcified dental structures. As such, this quantitative change can be detected and compared to known records.\n\n(8). Individual genetic information is packaged within nuclear and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cells - while nuclear DNA can be transmitted via either parental route, mitochondrial DNA is transmitted via the matrilineal line. DNA is extracted from tissues or bodily fluids that are collected for forensic analysis. Everyone has a characteristic “DNA fingerprint,” which allows a given forensic scientist to positively identify individuals. The two main types of DNA fingerprinting methods are restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the former being the most used in forensic analysis. However, the disadvantage of RFLP is that it requires large amounts of DNA (>100 ng). On the contrary, PCR can be employed even when only a small amount of DNA has been collected (<100 pg) or the DNA sample is fragmented. Thus, PCR is quite a robust technique because it amplifies the amount of DNA initially present, and it even allows a forensic scientist to analyze trace evidence obtained from blood , saliva, or fluid samples. Calcified and pulp tissues within teeth provide an odontologist with the most uncontaminated DNA samples; furthermore, dental pulp is a good source for determining blood groups. Due to the presence of ABO blood group antigens in soft and hard tissues, identifying the blood group of extremely decomposed remains is also made possible.\n\n(9). Sex of a decedent can be identified based on DNA analysis of the sex-linked amelogenin gene. In fact, sex determination is an important subdivision of forensic odontology, and it can greatly assist in the identification of subjects. Four methods allow odontologists to distinguish between the sexes : examining craniofacial morphology and dimension, tooth dimension, tooth morphology, and DNA analysis of sex chromosomes. One example that highlights sex differences in tooth morphology is that the distal accessory ridge of canines is more prominent in males than in females.\n\n(10). When the human or animal dentition contacts the surface of an object during the act of biting , a distinct pattern is likely imprinted upon that surface. This pattern can be assessed and compared to the dentition of those suspected to be involved in the forensic case. More particularly, the bite mark must have a certain class and individual characteristics that are consistent with an impression caused by dentition. Class characteristics include the size and shape of the bite mark - for instance, the dental arch size must be consistent with that of the alleged biter and the presence of a circular shape with two half arches (the maxilla and mandible) separated by a space (temporomandibular joint) must also be present. Since the maxilla has a greater arch length relative to the mandible, the pattern of the bite mark must mimic this asymmetry. Individual characteristics of a bite mark include hallmark patterns made by certain teeth; those associated with human dentition are as follows: maxillary central incisor—large rectangle; mandibular incisor and maxillary lateral incisor—small rectangle; cuspid—point or triangle; maxillary cuspid — figure eight pattern ; mandibular cuspid—point denoting the buccal cusp; molar—not commonly observed in human bite patterns.\n\n(11). Bite marks are known to change with the passage of time , especially if impressed upon living tissue. For instance, post-injury alterations such as bleeding, swelling, and discoloration can be observed in the tissue. If bite marks are discovered on a decedent, the patterns are photographed and then assessed with standardized techniques. Due to variations that exist in the arrangement, spacing, size, and shape of teeth and dental arches, no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition.\n\n(12). The reasons why no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition are similar to the reasons that a person’s individual dentition changes over their lifetime, as mentioned previously. Such reasons include genetics, environment, lifestyle, age, dental procedures performed, and medical or congenital conditions . Regarding genetics , an individual’s jaw size and tooth size, as well as the timeline of tooth development, are based on genetics, with each of the aforementioned factors contributing to the specific pattern of their dentition. Environmental factors impacting dentition include the level of nutrition one has access to during childhood, as well as injuries to the face or jaw at any point in life. Additionally, oral hygiene routines and diet can also individualize a person's dentition. Congenital disorders such as Down syndrome, teeth naturally degrading over time due to aging, and any modifications such as braces, implants, or extractions are also likely to make the dentition of a given individual unique."

Dental identification can be classified into four types, as established by the American Board of Forensic Odontology: (1) Positive identification : A match is established between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data confirming it is from the same individual; (2) Possible identification : Few consistent features are noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data, but identity cannot be established because of the quality of records; (3) Insufficient evidence : Inadequate data to form a conclusion; (4) Exclusion : Apparent inconsistencies noted between the ante-mortem and post-mortem data.\n\n(6). Assessing the age of dentition is significant in forensic dental evaluation of living individuals or human remains. Racial and sex differences in tooth developmental patterns exist and have been acknowledged; however, dentition age can still be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Chronological age assessment can be employed concomitantly with an evaluation of osseous tissue developmental stage to gain estimation for an individual under 20 years of age. Several dental age estimation procedures are available and while some predict age using radiographic changes associated with the development of dentition in children, others employ dental radiographs to estimate dental chronological age in adults, living or deceased. In 1950 , Gustafson first identified and classified six characteristics to estimate dentition age in an adult. These variables were based on his observation of ground sections of extracted teeth; they include attrition of the occlusal or incisal surfaces, deposition of apical cementum, degree of deposition of secondary dentin, attachment level of the periodontium, root resorption, and radicular translucency .\n\n(7). Certain dental tissues in living and deceased subjects can be dated biochemically by assessing the ratios of levorotatory and dextrorotatory isomers of the amino acid aspartate. The L form of aspartic acid gradually transforms into its D stereoisomer through racemization. As enamel and dentin age, levels of D aspartic acid rise in calcified dental structures. As such, this quantitative change can be detected and compared to known records.\n\n(8). Individual genetic information is packaged within nuclear and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cells - while nuclear DNA can be transmitted via either parental route, mitochondrial DNA is transmitted via the matrilineal line. DNA is extracted from tissues or bodily fluids that are collected for forensic analysis. Everyone has a characteristic “DNA fingerprint,” which allows a given forensic scientist to positively identify individuals. The two main types of DNA fingerprinting methods are restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the former being the most used in forensic analysis. However, the disadvantage of RFLP is that it requires large amounts of DNA (>100 ng). On the contrary, PCR can be employed even when only a small amount of DNA has been collected (<100 pg) or the DNA sample is fragmented. Thus, PCR is quite a robust technique because it amplifies the amount of DNA initially present, and it even allows a forensic scientist to analyze trace evidence obtained from blood , saliva, or fluid samples. Calcified and pulp tissues within teeth provide an odontologist with the most uncontaminated DNA samples; furthermore, dental pulp is a good source for determining blood groups. Due to the presence of ABO blood group antigens in soft and hard tissues, identifying the blood group of extremely decomposed remains is also made possible.\n\n(9). Sex of a decedent can be identified based on DNA analysis of the sex-linked amelogenin gene. In fact, sex determination is an important subdivision of forensic odontology, and it can greatly assist in the identification of subjects. Four methods allow odontologists to distinguish between the sexes : examining craniofacial morphology and dimension, tooth dimension, tooth morphology, and DNA analysis of sex chromosomes. One example that highlights sex differences in tooth morphology is that the distal accessory ridge of canines is more prominent in males than in females.\n\n(10). When the human or animal dentition contacts the surface of an object during the act of biting , a distinct pattern is likely imprinted upon that surface. This pattern can be assessed and compared to the dentition of those suspected to be involved in the forensic case. More particularly, the bite mark must have a certain class and individual characteristics that are consistent with an impression caused by dentition. Class characteristics include the size and shape of the bite mark - for instance, the dental arch size must be consistent with that of the alleged biter and the presence of a circular shape with two half arches (the maxilla and mandible) separated by a space (temporomandibular joint) must also be present. Since the maxilla has a greater arch length relative to the mandible, the pattern of the bite mark must mimic this asymmetry. Individual characteristics of a bite mark include hallmark patterns made by certain teeth; those associated with human dentition are as follows: maxillary central incisor—large rectangle; mandibular incisor and maxillary lateral incisor—small rectangle; cuspid—point or triangle; maxillary cuspid — figure eight pattern ; mandibular cuspid—point denoting the buccal cusp; molar—not commonly observed in human bite patterns.\n\n(11). Bite marks are known to change with the passage of time , especially if impressed upon living tissue. For instance, post-injury alterations such as bleeding, swelling, and discoloration can be observed in the tissue. If bite marks are discovered on a decedent, the patterns are photographed and then assessed with standardized techniques. Due to variations that exist in the arrangement, spacing, size, and shape of teeth and dental arches, no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition.\n\n(12). The reasons why no two individuals are believed to have identical dentition are similar to the reasons that a person’s individual dentition changes over their lifetime, as mentioned previously. Such reasons include genetics, environment, lifestyle, age, dental procedures performed, and medical or congenital conditions . Regarding genetics , an individual’s jaw size and tooth size, as well as the timeline of tooth development, are based on genetics, with each of the aforementioned factors contributing to the specific pattern of their dentition. Environmental factors impacting dentition include the level of nutrition one has access to during childhood, as well as injuries to the face or jaw at any point in life. Additionally, oral hygiene routines and diet can also individualize a person's dentition. Congenital disorders such as Down syndrome, teeth naturally degrading over time due to aging, and any modifications such as braces, implants, or extractions are also likely to make the dentition of a given individual unique."

      "text": "(1). Forensic dentistry or “ odontology ” is a field that blends dentistry and forensic science. It is concerned with evaluating, managing, and presenting dental evidence in legal proceedings in the interest of justice. One of the main objectives of forensic dentistry is to identify missing or unidentified individuals, human remains, victims of natural disasters, or fatal accidental events - to this end, comparisons of unidentified dentition and its supporting structures with established dental records is performed. Records may be accessed from several places, such as private dental offices, military dental databases, prisons, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation via its National Crime Information Center’s Missing, Unidentified, and Wanted Persons files in a Web environment.\n\n(2). Due to its multidisciplinary nature, contributions from anthropology, criminology, toxicology, pathology, and law are integral to forensic dental casework. Identification of remains via dental evidence is plausible because of the preservation of hard tissues even after death, and their ability to withstand extremely high temperatures , such as 1600°C without a significant loss in the microstructure. Evidence is primarily derived from four main areas : dental structures (jaws and teeth), age of dentition, dental DNA, and bite marks.\n\n(3). Anthropologists contribute to forensic dental casework by examining teeth to ascertain sex, age, and ancestry on the basis of structure, shape, and features of specific teeth. Criminologists have the ability to analyze bite marks found at crime scenes, while toxicologists play an important role because teeth and the tissues surrounding teeth often preserve substances such as drugs and heavy metals , which may help in determining a decedent’s cause of death. Toxicologists can also study teeth to determine an unknown individual’s birthplace using chemical isotope analysis. Pathologists contribute to the field on the basis of their ability to evaluate dental trauma, which may point to a manner of death. Furthermore, pathologists study postmortem changes in dental tissue to establish how long an individual has been dead. Finally, the legal system ensures that dental evidence is handled appropriately and ethically and also oversees the admissibility of such evidence in the courts.\n\n(4). Individual dentition is naturally dynamic ; its changes are visible throughout life as it undergoes the deciduous phase , which involves the exfoliation of primary dentition and the subsequent eruption of permanent dentition . The fluid nature of dentition presents unique challenges to odontologists, difficulties not encountered when examining static evidence markers, such as fingerprints and footprints. Furthermore, the possibility of dental and periodontal diseases, oral manifestations of systemic diseases, as well as restoration, replacement, and reconstructive oral procedures impact can alter dental structures. Despite the potential for an ever-changing dentition, an inspection of dental structures has remained a legally accepted method of forensic identification. Historically, significant cases that were resolved by examining dental evidence include the identification of Revolutionary War hero Dr. Joseph Warren , the infamous Boston murder victim Dr. George Parkman, and the notorious German dictator Adolph Hitler.\n\n(5).

      "text": "(1). Volcanoes have cultivated the geological landscape of Earth for an extremely long time. They have been around for multiple extinction events, shaping the environment of Earth for the evolution of life, from dinosaurs to humans. One of the most breathtaking outcomes of volcanic activity is geysers; the magma of the volcanoes plays an integral part in building the pressure force that invigorates geyser eruptions. Geysers are gaps on Earth’s surface that release superheated columns of steam and water , in some instances reaching a greater height than even the CN tower. With stable conditions, they can last for a few thousand years, yet the circumstances that support geyser formation are limited on Earth, which makes them a rare phenomenon. For this reason, the implementation of preservation systems in volcanic areas containing geysers can prove beneficial. The largest concentration of geysers on Earth is in Yellowstone National Park , which is also home to thousands of hot springs and the oldest volcano chain in North America.\n\n(2). Geyser formation depends on several key requirements. Water is stored in a reservoir, the starting point of an intricate plumbing system, which includes a series of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and cavities. The inner walls of the plumbing system are tightly coated with geyserite , a mineral composed mostly of silicon dioxide that acts like cement to reinforce the geyser’s structural integrity. Magma is another vital component, supplying constant heat to the water in the reservoir. A difference in temperature between the water underneath and the water near the surface leads to an accumulation of pressure, causing the geyser to erupt.\n\n(3). Water seeping underground and encountering rocks heated by magma initiates the eruption process . The heated water expands, lowers in density, and rises to the surface through porous and fractured rocks. As the geyser fills, the water at the top of the column cools, but the remaining water in the reservoir maintains its high temperature, as heat does not transfer in the narrow channels. The cooler water presses down on the hot water beneath, like the lid of a pressure cooker, causing its temperature to increase above the standard-pressure boiling point in a process called “ superheating .” The combination of high temperature and pressure forces the steam bubbles to climb to the top of the column; the bubbles then burst through the geyser’s vent, spewing out water and lowering the weight, thus also lowering the pressure on the water below. Shortly after, the superheated water turns into steam and violently boils throughout the column. The steam and hot water then combine to form a froth that explodes out of the geyser vent.\n\n(4). Geyserite acts as insurance for geyser activity because it blocks pressure from escaping the channels and damaging the surrounding framework. Geyserite also minimizes the exposure of the loose gravel and soil underneath the geyser to immense pressure. Overall, it maintains a secure environment for the geyser to properly continue its function. Eruption ends when the remaining water in the geyser cools back down to below boiling point. The duration of eruption and time between consecutive eruptions fluctuates from one geyser to another; for instance, Strokkur in Iceland erupts every few seconds to every few minutes , while Grand Geyser in the US erupts for 10 minutes every 8-12 hours .\n\n(5). Geysers are generally categorized as either steam-driven or cold-water . Steam-driven geysers consist of the fountain and cone types, brief and intense outbursts characterize fountain geysers , while cone geysers are composed of mounds of minerals erupting in steady jets lasting from a few minutes to more than an hour . Yellowstone National Park contains examples of both steam-driven and cold-water geysers and is known for its abundant geothermal features. Old Faithful is a cone geyser , possibly the best-known geyser in the world. On the other hand, the tallest predictable geyser on Earth is a fountain geyser named Grand Geyser .\n\n(6). Cold-water geysers are driven by the collection of CO 2 in underground lakes called aquifers . The weight of the water above contains the pressure of the CO 2 bubbles until the exterior rock layer is weakened and an opening is created. The expansion of bubbles then causes a forceful thrust of water toward the surface. Cold-water geysers are rarer than other types of geysers, and they are only present in the US, Germany, Slovakia, and Brazil.\n\n(7). In addition to Earth, Geyser-like projections have also been observed in other places in the Solar System. Cryogeysers are characterized by the absence of liquid and the low boiling point of the ejected material, made of ice particles or dust. It is believed that a complex process called “ tidal heating ” provides the thermal energy in cryogersers. Eruptions consisting of water vapor, ice particles, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrocarbons have been observed in the south polar region of Saturn’s moon, Enceladus. Similarly, water vapor plumes have been detected by the Hubble Space Telescope over the south polar region of Europa , one of Jupiter’s moons. Moreover, eruptions on Triton, a moon of Neptune, have been detected by satellite images. Scientists identified the plumes based on the dark spots, which represent invisible streams of gaseous nitrogen with dust.\n\n(8). On Earth, geysers harbor life for thermophilic prokaryotes , which thrive in extremely hot environments. The 1960s marked the first time in history when geysers became an interest in the scientific community; at the time, it was believed that no living creature could survive above 73° C, because this was assumed to be the limit at which protein and DNA structure would begin to deteriorate. However, it was later discovered that thermophiles prefer temperatures from 50° to 70° C, while hyperthermophiles operate more efficiently in temperatures ranging from 80° to 110° C. The heat-stable enzymes of these prokaryotes have been extracted and modified to create tools related to antibiotics, plastics, and detergents , while some of the most important applications of the thermophilic enzymes today occur in the fields of medicine and biotechnology. The first of this kind is Thermus Aquaticus , which is critical to the process of PCR amplification; these prokaryotes are also responsible for the colorful displays sometimes witnessed during a geyser eruption. Photosynthetic activity of the cyanobacteria, which use carotenoids that are colored orange, yellow and red, rather than the typical green pigments of chlorophyll, is the underlying cause of this graphic (it should be noted that the abovementioned color phenomenon is much more common in hot springs).\n\n(9). The conditions that support geysers rarely occur together – thus, they are only present in a few places on Earth. The greatest aggregation of geysers is in Yellowstone National Park, where half of the world’s geysers reside, along with thousands of hot springs. The next highest concentration occurs in Russia’s “Valley of Geysers ,” which is home to approximately 200 geysers . Vigorous volcanic activity is largely responsible for the formation of the area and the eruptions in The Valley occur at a peculiar angle, a feature that is as strange as it is exclusive.\n\n(10). The largest geyser ever known, “ Waimangu ,” was in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of New Zealand. Studies show the crust below this geyser was 5-kilometer-thick, and further bolstered by a magma film beneath that stretched 50 km wide and 160 km long. Eruptions of this natural wonder would typically reach 160 metres, and some super bursts are known to have reached 500 m. However, four years after it began erupting, the water table was disrupted by a landslide and its function seized. Unfortunately, many more of the geysers in New Zealand have been destroyed by human activity within the past century.\n\n(11). Geysers are quite sensitive to changes in environmental conditions . For example, a minimal adjustment such as a loose rock structure could lead to the erosion of channels and destruction of nascent geysers. Geysers can also go extinct simply by debris being thrown into them by people, or via the draining of their water reservoir by geothermal water plants for energy production. Less frequently, they cycle through periods of dormancy and activity, as is the case with The Geysir in Iceland .\n\n(12). As incredible and uncommon as they are, geysers should be a point of protection for environmentalists . On the 15th of September 2018, one of the geysers in Yellowstone national park exploded, releasing hundreds of coins and other man-made garbage, some of which were identified to be almost 100 years old by park officials. Amongst historical coins, the eruption of Ear Spring geyser revealed plastic cups, cigarette butts, old aluminum cans, and a broken bottle . The park officials also reported increasing hydrothermal activity in Geyser Hill, which could ultimately lead to a small explosion. Beyond damaging their ecosystem , trashing geysers could have direct health risks for tourists because of exploding debris. For these reasons and more, it would be a great disservice to humanity and nature to damage these remarkable structures."

      "text": "(1). Volcanoes have cultivated the geological landscape of Earth for an extremely long time. They have been around for multiple extinction events, shaping the environment of Earth for the evolution of life, from dinosaurs to humans. One of the most breathtaking outcomes of volcanic activity is geysers; the magma of the volcanoes plays an integral part in building the pressure force that invigorates geyser eruptions. Geysers are gaps on Earth’s surface that release superheated columns of steam and water , in some instances reaching a greater height than even the CN tower. With stable conditions, they can last for a few thousand years, yet the circumstances that support geyser formation are limited on Earth, which makes them a rare phenomenon. For this reason, the implementation of preservation systems in volcanic areas containing geysers can prove beneficial. The largest concentration of geysers on Earth is in Yellowstone National Park , which is also home to thousands of hot springs and the oldest volcano chain in North America.\n\n(2). Geyser formation depends on several key requirements. Water is stored in a reservoir, the starting point of an intricate plumbing system, which includes a series of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and cavities. The inner walls of the plumbing system are tightly coated with geyserite , a mineral composed mostly of silicon dioxide that acts like cement to reinforce the geyser’s structural integrity. Magma is another vital component, supplying constant heat to the water in the reservoir. A difference in temperature between the water underneath and the water near the surface leads to an accumulation of pressure, causing the geyser to erupt.\n\n(3). Water seeping underground and encountering rocks heated by magma initiates the eruption process . The heated water expands, lowers in density, and rises to the surface through porous and fractured rocks. As the geyser fills, the water at the top of the column cools, but the remaining water in the reservoir maintains its high temperature, as heat does not transfer in the narrow channels. The cooler water presses down on the hot water beneath, like the lid of a pressure cooker, causing its temperature to increase above the standard-pressure boiling point in a process called “ superheating .” The combination of high temperature and pressure forces the steam bubbles to climb to the top of the column; the bubbles then burst through the geyser’s vent, spewing out water and lowering the weight, thus also lowering the pressure on the water below. Shortly after, the superheated water turns into steam and violently boils throughout the column. The steam and hot water then combine to form a froth that explodes out of the geyser vent.\n\n(4). Geyserite acts as insurance for geyser activity because it blocks pressure from escaping the channels and damaging the surrounding framework. Geyserite also minimizes the exposure of the loose gravel and soil underneath the geyser to immense pressure. Overall, it maintains a secure environment for the geyser to properly continue its function. Eruption ends when the remaining water in the geyser cools back down to below boiling point. The duration of eruption and time between consecutive eruptions fluctuates from one geyser to another; for instance, Strokkur in Iceland erupts every few seconds to every few minutes , while Grand Geyser in the US erupts for 10 minutes every 8-12 hours .\n\n(5). Geysers are generally categorized as either steam-driven or cold-water . Steam-driven geysers consist of the fountain and cone types, brief and intense outbursts characterize fountain geysers , while cone geysers are composed of mounds of minerals erupting in steady jets lasting from a few minutes to more than an hour . Yellowstone National Park contains examples of both steam-driven and cold-water geysers and is known for its abundant geothermal features. Old Faithful is a cone geyser , possibly the best-known geyser in the world. On the other hand, the tallest predictable geyser on Earth is a fountain geyser named Grand Geyser .\n\n(6). Cold-water geysers are driven by the collection of CO 2 in underground lakes called aquifers . The weight of the water above contains the pressure of the CO 2 bubbles until the exterior rock layer is weakened and an opening is created. The expansion of bubbles then causes a forceful thrust of water toward the surface. Cold-water geysers are rarer than other types of geysers, and they are only present in the US, Germany, Slovakia, and Brazil.\n\n(7). In addition to Earth, Geyser-like projections have also been observed in other places in the Solar System. Cryogeysers are characterized by the absence of liquid and the low boiling point of the ejected material, made of ice particles or dust. It is believed that a complex process called “ tidal heating ” provides the thermal energy in cryogersers. Eruptions consisting of water vapor, ice particles, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrocarbons have been observed in the south polar region of Saturn’s moon, Enceladus. Similarly, water vapor plumes have been detected by the Hubble Space Telescope over the south polar region of Europa , one of Jupiter’s moons. Moreover, eruptions on Triton, a moon of Neptune, have been detected by satellite images. Scientists identified the plumes based on the dark spots, which represent invisible streams of gaseous nitrogen with dust.\n\n(8). On Earth, geysers harbor life for thermophilic prokaryotes , which thrive in extremely hot environments. The 1960s marked the first time in history when geysers became an interest in the scientific community; at the time, it was believed that no living creature could survive above 73° C, because this was assumed to be the limit at which protein and DNA structure would begin to deteriorate. However, it was later discovered that thermophiles prefer temperatures from 50° to 70° C, while hyperthermophiles operate more efficiently in temperatures ranging from 80° to 110° C. The heat-stable enzymes of these prokaryotes have been extracted and modified to create tools related to antibiotics, plastics, and detergents , while some of the most important applications of the thermophilic enzymes today occur in the fields of medicine and biotechnology. The first of this kind is Thermus Aquaticus , which is critical to the process of PCR amplification; these prokaryotes are also responsible for the colorful displays sometimes witnessed during a geyser eruption. Photosynthetic activity of the cyanobacteria, which use carotenoids that are colored orange, yellow and red, rather than the typical green pigments of chlorophyll, is the underlying cause of this graphic (it should be noted that the abovementioned color phenomenon is much more common in hot springs).\n\n(9). The conditions that support geysers rarely occur together – thus, they are only present in a few places on Earth. The greatest aggregation of geysers is in Yellowstone National Park, where half of the world’s geysers reside, along with thousands of hot springs. The next highest concentration occurs in Russia’s “Valley of Geysers ,” which is home to approximately 200 geysers . Vigorous volcanic activity is largely responsible for the formation of the area and the eruptions in The Valley occur at a peculiar angle, a feature that is as strange as it is exclusive.\n\n(10). The largest geyser ever known, “ Waimangu ,” was in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of New Zealand. Studies show the crust below this geyser was 5-kilometer-thick, and further bolstered by a magma film beneath that stretched 50 km wide and 160 km long. Eruptions of this natural wonder would typically reach 160 metres, and some super bursts are known to have reached 500 m. However, four years after it began erupting, the water table was disrupted by a landslide and its function seized. Unfortunately, many more of the geysers in New Zealand have been destroyed by human activity within the past century.\n\n(11). Geysers are quite sensitive to changes in environmental conditions . For example, a minimal adjustment such as a loose rock structure could lead to the erosion of channels and destruction of nascent geysers. Geysers can also go extinct simply by debris being thrown into them by people, or via the draining of their water reservoir by geothermal water plants for energy production. Less frequently, they cycle through periods of dormancy and activity, as is the case with The Geysir in Iceland .\n\n(12). As incredible and uncommon as they are, geysers should be a point of protection for environmentalists . On the 15th of September 2018, one of the geysers in Yellowstone national park exploded, releasing hundreds of coins and other man-made garbage, some of which were identified to be almost 100 years old by park officials. Amongst historical coins, the eruption of Ear Spring geyser revealed plastic cups, cigarette butts, old aluminum cans, and a broken bottle . The park officials also reported increasing hydrothermal activity in Geyser Hill, which could ultimately lead to a small explosion. Beyond damaging their ecosystem , trashing geysers could have direct health risks for tourists because of exploding debris. For these reasons and more, it would be a great disservice to humanity and nature to damage these remarkable structures."

In paragraph three, the author explains the process of geyser eruption.

The phrase, “like the lid of a pressure cooker,” uses a familiar kitchen appliance to provide a mental image of the interaction of pressure and temperature - otherwise, it would be difficult to conceptualize the interaction of two liquids in such a way. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",

Cold-water geysers are rarer than other types of geysers, and they are only present in the US, Germany, Slovakia, and Brazil.\n\n(7). In addition to Earth, Geyser-like projections have also been observed in other places in the Solar System. Cryogeysers are characterized by the absence of liquid and the low boiling point of the ejected material, made of ice particles or dust. It is believed that a complex process called “ tidal heating ” provides the thermal energy in cryogersers. Eruptions consisting of water vapor, ice particles, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrocarbons have been observed in the south polar region of Saturn’s moon, Enceladus. Similarly, water vapor plumes have been detected by the Hubble Space Telescope over the south polar region of Europa , one of Jupiter’s moons. Moreover, eruptions on Triton, a moon of Neptune, have been detected by satellite images. Scientists identified the plumes based on the dark spots, which represent invisible streams of gaseous nitrogen with dust.\n\n(8). On Earth, geysers harbor life for thermophilic prokaryotes , which thrive in extremely hot environments. The 1960s marked the first time in history when geysers became an interest in the scientific community; at the time, it was believed that no living creature could survive above 73° C, because this was assumed to be the limit at which protein and DNA structure would begin to deteriorate. However, it was later discovered that thermophiles prefer temperatures from 50° to 70° C, while hyperthermophiles operate more efficiently in temperatures ranging from 80° to 110° C. The heat-stable enzymes of these prokaryotes have been extracted and modified to create tools related to antibiotics, plastics, and detergents , while some of the most important applications of the thermophilic enzymes today occur in the fields of medicine and biotechnology. The first of this kind is Thermus Aquaticus , which is critical to the process of PCR amplification; these prokaryotes are also responsible for the colorful displays sometimes witnessed during a geyser eruption. Photosynthetic activity of the cyanobacteria, which use carotenoids that are colored orange, yellow and red, rather than the typical green pigments of chlorophyll, is the underlying cause of this graphic (it should be noted that the abovementioned color phenomenon is much more common in hot springs).\n\n(9). The conditions that support geysers rarely occur together – thus, they are only present in a few places on Earth. The greatest aggregation of geysers is in Yellowstone National Park, where half of the world’s geysers reside, along with thousands of hot springs. The next highest concentration occurs in Russia’s “Valley of Geysers ,” which is home to approximately 200 geysers . Vigorous volcanic activity is largely responsible for the formation of the area and the eruptions in The Valley occur at a peculiar angle, a feature that is as strange as it is exclusive.\n\n(10). The largest geyser ever known, “ Waimangu ,” was in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of New Zealand. Studies show the crust below this geyser was 5-kilometer-thick, and further bolstered by a magma film beneath that stretched 50 km wide and 160 km long. Eruptions of this natural wonder would typically reach 160 metres, and some super bursts are known to have reached 500 m. However, four years after it began erupting, the water table was disrupted by a landslide and its function seized. Unfortunately, many more of the geysers in New Zealand have been destroyed by human activity within the past century.\n\n(11). Geysers are quite sensitive to changes in environmental conditions . For example, a minimal adjustment such as a loose rock structure could lead to the erosion of channels and destruction of nascent geysers. Geysers can also go extinct simply by debris being thrown into them by people, or via the draining of their water reservoir by geothermal water plants for energy production. Less frequently, they cycle through periods of dormancy and activity, as is the case with The Geysir in Iceland .\n\n(12). As incredible and uncommon as they are, geysers should be a point of protection for environmentalists . On the 15th of September 2018, one of the geysers in Yellowstone national park exploded, releasing hundreds of coins and other man-made garbage, some of which were identified to be almost 100 years old by park officials. Amongst historical coins, the eruption of Ear Spring geyser revealed plastic cups, cigarette butts, old aluminum cans, and a broken bottle . The park officials also reported increasing hydrothermal activity in Geyser Hill, which could ultimately lead to a small explosion. Beyond damaging their ecosystem , trashing geysers could have direct health risks for tourists because of exploding debris. For these reasons and more, it would be a great disservice to humanity and nature to damage these remarkable structures."

      "concept_text": "This question requires the application of concepts and some critical thinking skills. The use of hard vocabulary in the answers is meant to throw off the candidate and make them spend more time on the question. To decide which answer is best, we first need to analyze the contents of the fourth paragraph. Geyserite, eruption re-initiation, and eruption times are the main key ideas mentioned. To answer this question, we should search the passage for references to fountain geysers. Fountain geysers are discussed only in paragraph 5; regarding their characteristics, it reads: “Geysers are generally categorized as either steam-driven or cold-water. Steam-driven geysers consist of fountain and cone types, brief and intense outbursts characterize fountain geysers, while cone geysers are composed of mounds of minerals erupting in steady jets lasting from a few minutes to more than an hour.” This tells us that one characteristic of fountain geysers is brief and intense outbursts. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. They expel steady mounds of minerals – is incorrect because this is a characteristic of cone geysers, as specified in paragraph 5: “…cone geysers are composed of mounds of minerals erupting in steady jets lasting from a few minutes to more than an hour.” Option C. They expel ice particles and dust – is incorrect because ice particles and dust are a characteristic of cryogeysers, as stated in paragraph 7: “Cryogeysers are characterized by the absence of liquid and the low boiling point of the ejected material, made of ice particles or dust.” Option D.

Vigorous volcanic activity is largely responsible for the formation of the area and the eruptions in The Valley occur at a peculiar angle, a feature that is as strange as it is exclusive.”",

      "text": "(1). Volcanoes have cultivated the geological landscape of Earth for an extremely long time. They have been around for multiple extinction events, shaping the environment of Earth for the evolution of life, from dinosaurs to humans. One of the most breathtaking outcomes of volcanic activity is geysers; the magma of the volcanoes plays an integral part in building the pressure force that invigorates geyser eruptions. Geysers are gaps on Earth’s surface that release superheated columns of steam and water , in some instances reaching a greater height than even the CN tower. With stable conditions, they can last for a few thousand years, yet the circumstances that support geyser formation are limited on Earth, which makes them a rare phenomenon. For this reason, the implementation of preservation systems in volcanic areas containing geysers can prove beneficial. The largest concentration of geysers on Earth is in Yellowstone National Park , which is also home to thousands of hot springs and the oldest volcano chain in North America.\n\n(2). Geyser formation depends on several key requirements. Water is stored in a reservoir, the starting point of an intricate plumbing system, which includes a series of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and cavities. The inner walls of the plumbing system are tightly coated with geyserite , a mineral composed mostly of silicon dioxide that acts like cement to reinforce the geyser’s structural integrity. Magma is another vital component, supplying constant heat to the water in the reservoir. A difference in temperature between the water underneath and the water near the surface leads to an accumulation of pressure, causing the geyser to erupt.\n\n(3). Water seeping underground and encountering rocks heated by magma initiates the eruption process . The heated water expands, lowers in density, and rises to the surface through porous and fractured rocks. As the geyser fills, the water at the top of the column cools, but the remaining water in the reservoir maintains its high temperature, as heat does not transfer in the narrow channels. The cooler water presses down on the hot water beneath, like the lid of a pressure cooker, causing its temperature to increase above the standard-pressure boiling point in a process called “ superheating .” The combination of high temperature and pressure forces the steam bubbles to climb to the top of the column; the bubbles then burst through the geyser’s vent, spewing out water and lowering the weight, thus also lowering the pressure on the water below. Shortly after, the superheated water turns into steam and violently boils throughout the column. The steam and hot water then combine to form a froth that explodes out of the geyser vent.\n\n(4). Geyserite acts as insurance for geyser activity because it blocks pressure from escaping the channels and damaging the surrounding framework. Geyserite also minimizes the exposure of the loose gravel and soil underneath the geyser to immense pressure. Overall, it maintains a secure environment for the geyser to properly continue its function. Eruption ends when the remaining water in the geyser cools back down to below boiling point. The duration of eruption and time between consecutive eruptions fluctuates from one geyser to another; for instance, Strokkur in Iceland erupts every few seconds to every few minutes , while Grand Geyser in the US erupts for 10 minutes every 8-12 hours .\n\n(5). Geysers are generally categorized as either steam-driven or cold-water . Steam-driven geysers consist of the fountain and cone types, brief and intense outbursts characterize fountain geysers , while cone geysers are composed of mounds of minerals erupting in steady jets lasting from a few minutes to more than an hour . Yellowstone National Park contains examples of both steam-driven and cold-water geysers and is known for its abundant geothermal features. Old Faithful is a cone geyser , possibly the best-known geyser in the world. On the other hand, the tallest predictable geyser on Earth is a fountain geyser named Grand Geyser .\n\n(6). Cold-water geysers are driven by the collection of CO 2 in underground lakes called aquifers . The weight of the water above contains the pressure of the CO 2 bubbles until the exterior rock layer is weakened and an opening is created. The expansion of bubbles then causes a forceful thrust of water toward the surface. Cold-water geysers are rarer than other types of geysers, and they are only present in the US, Germany, Slovakia, and Brazil.\n\n(7).

      "text": "(1). Volcanoes have cultivated the geological landscape of Earth for an extremely long time. They have been around for multiple extinction events, shaping the environment of Earth for the evolution of life, from dinosaurs to humans. One of the most breathtaking outcomes of volcanic activity is geysers; the magma of the volcanoes plays an integral part in building the pressure force that invigorates geyser eruptions. Geysers are gaps on Earth’s surface that release superheated columns of steam and water , in some instances reaching a greater height than even the CN tower. With stable conditions, they can last for a few thousand years, yet the circumstances that support geyser formation are limited on Earth, which makes them a rare phenomenon. For this reason, the implementation of preservation systems in volcanic areas containing geysers can prove beneficial. The largest concentration of geysers on Earth is in Yellowstone National Park , which is also home to thousands of hot springs and the oldest volcano chain in North America.\n\n(2). Geyser formation depends on several key requirements. Water is stored in a reservoir, the starting point of an intricate plumbing system, which includes a series of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and cavities. The inner walls of the plumbing system are tightly coated with geyserite , a mineral composed mostly of silicon dioxide that acts like cement to reinforce the geyser’s structural integrity. Magma is another vital component, supplying constant heat to the water in the reservoir. A difference in temperature between the water underneath and the water near the surface leads to an accumulation of pressure, causing the geyser to erupt.\n\n(3). Water seeping underground and encountering rocks heated by magma initiates the eruption process . The heated water expands, lowers in density, and rises to the surface through porous and fractured rocks. As the geyser fills, the water at the top of the column cools, but the remaining water in the reservoir maintains its high temperature, as heat does not transfer in the narrow channels. The cooler water presses down on the hot water beneath, like the lid of a pressure cooker, causing its temperature to increase above the standard-pressure boiling point in a process called “ superheating .” The combination of high temperature and pressure forces the steam bubbles to climb to the top of the column; the bubbles then burst through the geyser’s vent, spewing out water and lowering the weight, thus also lowering the pressure on the water below. Shortly after, the superheated water turns into steam and violently boils throughout the column. The steam and hot water then combine to form a froth that explodes out of the geyser vent.\n\n(4). Geyserite acts as insurance for geyser activity because it blocks pressure from escaping the channels and damaging the surrounding framework. Geyserite also minimizes the exposure of the loose gravel and soil underneath the geyser to immense pressure. Overall, it maintains a secure environment for the geyser to properly continue its function. Eruption ends when the remaining water in the geyser cools back down to below boiling point. The duration of eruption and time between consecutive eruptions fluctuates from one geyser to another; for instance, Strokkur in Iceland erupts every few seconds to every few minutes , while Grand Geyser in the US erupts for 10 minutes every 8-12 hours .\n\n(5). Geysers are generally categorized as either steam-driven or cold-water . Steam-driven geysers consist of the fountain and cone types, brief and intense outbursts characterize fountain geysers , while cone geysers are composed of mounds of minerals erupting in steady jets lasting from a few minutes to more than an hour . Yellowstone National Park contains examples of both steam-driven and cold-water geysers and is known for its abundant geothermal features. Old Faithful is a cone geyser , possibly the best-known geyser in the world. On the other hand, the tallest predictable geyser on Earth is a fountain geyser named Grand Geyser .\n\n(6). Cold-water geysers are driven by the collection of CO 2 in underground lakes called aquifers . The weight of the water above contains the pressure of the CO 2 bubbles until the exterior rock layer is weakened and an opening is created. The expansion of bubbles then causes a forceful thrust of water toward the surface. Cold-water geysers are rarer than other types of geysers, and they are only present in the US, Germany, Slovakia, and Brazil.\n\n(7). In addition to Earth, Geyser-like projections have also been observed in other places in the Solar System. Cryogeysers are characterized by the absence of liquid and the low boiling point of the ejected material, made of ice particles or dust. It is believed that a complex process called “ tidal heating ” provides the thermal energy in cryogersers. Eruptions consisting of water vapor, ice particles, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrocarbons have been observed in the south polar region of Saturn’s moon, Enceladus. Similarly, water vapor plumes have been detected by the Hubble Space Telescope over the south polar region of Europa , one of Jupiter’s moons. Moreover, eruptions on Triton, a moon of Neptune, have been detected by satellite images. Scientists identified the plumes based on the dark spots, which represent invisible streams of gaseous nitrogen with dust.\n\n(8). On Earth, geysers harbor life for thermophilic prokaryotes , which thrive in extremely hot environments. The 1960s marked the first time in history when geysers became an interest in the scientific community; at the time, it was believed that no living creature could survive above 73° C, because this was assumed to be the limit at which protein and DNA structure would begin to deteriorate. However, it was later discovered that thermophiles prefer temperatures from 50° to 70° C, while hyperthermophiles operate more efficiently in temperatures ranging from 80° to 110° C. The heat-stable enzymes of these prokaryotes have been extracted and modified to create tools related to antibiotics, plastics, and detergents , while some of the most important applications of the thermophilic enzymes today occur in the fields of medicine and biotechnology. The first of this kind is Thermus Aquaticus , which is critical to the process of PCR amplification; these prokaryotes are also responsible for the colorful displays sometimes witnessed during a geyser eruption. Photosynthetic activity of the cyanobacteria, which use carotenoids that are colored orange, yellow and red, rather than the typical green pigments of chlorophyll, is the underlying cause of this graphic (it should be noted that the abovementioned color phenomenon is much more common in hot springs).\n\n(9). The conditions that support geysers rarely occur together – thus, they are only present in a few places on Earth. The greatest aggregation of geysers is in Yellowstone National Park, where half of the world’s geysers reside, along with thousands of hot springs. The next highest concentration occurs in Russia’s “Valley of Geysers ,” which is home to approximately 200 geysers . Vigorous volcanic activity is largely responsible for the formation of the area and the eruptions in The Valley occur at a peculiar angle, a feature that is as strange as it is exclusive.\n\n(10). The largest geyser ever known, “ Waimangu ,” was in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of New Zealand. Studies show the crust below this geyser was 5-kilometer-thick, and further bolstered by a magma film beneath that stretched 50 km wide and 160 km long. Eruptions of this natural wonder would typically reach 160 metres, and some super bursts are known to have reached 500 m. However, four years after it began erupting, the water table was disrupted by a landslide and its function seized. Unfortunately, many more of the geysers in New Zealand have been destroyed by human activity within the past century.\n\n(11). Geysers are quite sensitive to changes in environmental conditions . For example, a minimal adjustment such as a loose rock structure could lead to the erosion of channels and destruction of nascent geysers. Geysers can also go extinct simply by debris being thrown into them by people, or via the draining of their water reservoir by geothermal water plants for energy production. Less frequently, they cycle through periods of dormancy and activity, as is the case with The Geysir in Iceland .\n\n(12). As incredible and uncommon as they are, geysers should be a point of protection for environmentalists . On the 15th of September 2018, one of the geysers in Yellowstone national park exploded, releasing hundreds of coins and other man-made garbage, some of which were identified to be almost 100 years old by park officials. Amongst historical coins, the eruption of Ear Spring geyser revealed plastic cups, cigarette butts, old aluminum cans, and a broken bottle . The park officials also reported increasing hydrothermal activity in Geyser Hill, which could ultimately lead to a small explosion. Beyond damaging their ecosystem , trashing geysers could have direct health risks for tourists because of exploding debris. For these reasons and more, it would be a great disservice to humanity and nature to damage these remarkable structures."

      "text": "(1). Volcanoes have cultivated the geological landscape of Earth for an extremely long time. They have been around for multiple extinction events, shaping the environment of Earth for the evolution of life, from dinosaurs to humans. One of the most breathtaking outcomes of volcanic activity is geysers; the magma of the volcanoes plays an integral part in building the pressure force that invigorates geyser eruptions. Geysers are gaps on Earth’s surface that release superheated columns of steam and water , in some instances reaching a greater height than even the CN tower. With stable conditions, they can last for a few thousand years, yet the circumstances that support geyser formation are limited on Earth, which makes them a rare phenomenon. For this reason, the implementation of preservation systems in volcanic areas containing geysers can prove beneficial. The largest concentration of geysers on Earth is in Yellowstone National Park , which is also home to thousands of hot springs and the oldest volcano chain in North America.\n\n(2). Geyser formation depends on several key requirements. Water is stored in a reservoir, the starting point of an intricate plumbing system, which includes a series of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and cavities. The inner walls of the plumbing system are tightly coated with geyserite , a mineral composed mostly of silicon dioxide that acts like cement to reinforce the geyser’s structural integrity. Magma is another vital component, supplying constant heat to the water in the reservoir. A difference in temperature between the water underneath and the water near the surface leads to an accumulation of pressure, causing the geyser to erupt.\n\n(3). Water seeping underground and encountering rocks heated by magma initiates the eruption process . The heated water expands, lowers in density, and rises to the surface through porous and fractured rocks. As the geyser fills, the water at the top of the column cools, but the remaining water in the reservoir maintains its high temperature, as heat does not transfer in the narrow channels. The cooler water presses down on the hot water beneath, like the lid of a pressure cooker, causing its temperature to increase above the standard-pressure boiling point in a process called “ superheating .” The combination of high temperature and pressure forces the steam bubbles to climb to the top of the column; the bubbles then burst through the geyser’s vent, spewing out water and lowering the weight, thus also lowering the pressure on the water below. Shortly after, the superheated water turns into steam and violently boils throughout the column. The steam and hot water then combine to form a froth that explodes out of the geyser vent.\n\n(4). Geyserite acts as insurance for geyser activity because it blocks pressure from escaping the channels and damaging the surrounding framework. Geyserite also minimizes the exposure of the loose gravel and soil underneath the geyser to immense pressure. Overall, it maintains a secure environment for the geyser to properly continue its function. Eruption ends when the remaining water in the geyser cools back down to below boiling point. The duration of eruption and time between consecutive eruptions fluctuates from one geyser to another; for instance, Strokkur in Iceland erupts every few seconds to every few minutes , while Grand Geyser in the US erupts for 10 minutes every 8-12 hours .\n\n(5). Geysers are generally categorized as either steam-driven or cold-water . Steam-driven geysers consist of the fountain and cone types, brief and intense outbursts characterize fountain geysers , while cone geysers are composed of mounds of minerals erupting in steady jets lasting from a few minutes to more than an hour . Yellowstone National Park contains examples of both steam-driven and cold-water geysers and is known for its abundant geothermal features. Old Faithful is a cone geyser , possibly the best-known geyser in the world. On the other hand, the tallest predictable geyser on Earth is a fountain geyser named Grand Geyser .\n\n(6). Cold-water geysers are driven by the collection of CO 2 in underground lakes called aquifers . The weight of the water above contains the pressure of the CO 2 bubbles until the exterior rock layer is weakened and an opening is created. The expansion of bubbles then causes a forceful thrust of water toward the surface. Cold-water geysers are rarer than other types of geysers, and they are only present in the US, Germany, Slovakia, and Brazil.\n\n(7). In addition to Earth, Geyser-like projections have also been observed in other places in the Solar System. Cryogeysers are characterized by the absence of liquid and the low boiling point of the ejected material, made of ice particles or dust. It is believed that a complex process called “ tidal heating ” provides the thermal energy in cryogersers. Eruptions consisting of water vapor, ice particles, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrocarbons have been observed in the south polar region of Saturn’s moon, Enceladus. Similarly, water vapor plumes have been detected by the Hubble Space Telescope over the south polar region of Europa , one of Jupiter’s moons. Moreover, eruptions on Triton, a moon of Neptune, have been detected by satellite images. Scientists identified the plumes based on the dark spots, which represent invisible streams of gaseous nitrogen with dust.\n\n(8). On Earth, geysers harbor life for thermophilic prokaryotes , which thrive in extremely hot environments. The 1960s marked the first time in history when geysers became an interest in the scientific community; at the time, it was believed that no living creature could survive above 73° C, because this was assumed to be the limit at which protein and DNA structure would begin to deteriorate. However, it was later discovered that thermophiles prefer temperatures from 50° to 70° C, while hyperthermophiles operate more efficiently in temperatures ranging from 80° to 110° C. The heat-stable enzymes of these prokaryotes have been extracted and modified to create tools related to antibiotics, plastics, and detergents , while some of the most important applications of the thermophilic enzymes today occur in the fields of medicine and biotechnology. The first of this kind is Thermus Aquaticus , which is critical to the process of PCR amplification; these prokaryotes are also responsible for the colorful displays sometimes witnessed during a geyser eruption. Photosynthetic activity of the cyanobacteria, which use carotenoids that are colored orange, yellow and red, rather than the typical green pigments of chlorophyll, is the underlying cause of this graphic (it should be noted that the abovementioned color phenomenon is much more common in hot springs).\n\n(9). The conditions that support geysers rarely occur together – thus, they are only present in a few places on Earth. The greatest aggregation of geysers is in Yellowstone National Park, where half of the world’s geysers reside, along with thousands of hot springs. The next highest concentration occurs in Russia’s “Valley of Geysers ,” which is home to approximately 200 geysers . Vigorous volcanic activity is largely responsible for the formation of the area and the eruptions in The Valley occur at a peculiar angle, a feature that is as strange as it is exclusive.\n\n(10). The largest geyser ever known, “ Waimangu ,” was in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of New Zealand. Studies show the crust below this geyser was 5-kilometer-thick, and further bolstered by a magma film beneath that stretched 50 km wide and 160 km long. Eruptions of this natural wonder would typically reach 160 metres, and some super bursts are known to have reached 500 m. However, four years after it began erupting, the water table was disrupted by a landslide and its function seized. Unfortunately, many more of the geysers in New Zealand have been destroyed by human activity within the past century.\n\n(11). Geysers are quite sensitive to changes in environmental conditions . For example, a minimal adjustment such as a loose rock structure could lead to the erosion of channels and destruction of nascent geysers. Geysers can also go extinct simply by debris being thrown into them by people, or via the draining of their water reservoir by geothermal water plants for energy production. Less frequently, they cycle through periods of dormancy and activity, as is the case with The Geysir in Iceland .\n\n(12).

Steam-driven geysers consist of the fountain and cone types, brief and intense outbursts characterize fountain geysers , while cone geysers are composed of mounds of minerals erupting in steady jets lasting from a few minutes to more than an hour . Yellowstone National Park contains examples of both steam-driven and cold-water geysers and is known for its abundant geothermal features. Old Faithful is a cone geyser , possibly the best-known geyser in the world. On the other hand, the tallest predictable geyser on Earth is a fountain geyser named Grand Geyser .\n\n(6). Cold-water geysers are driven by the collection of CO 2 in underground lakes called aquifers . The weight of the water above contains the pressure of the CO 2 bubbles until the exterior rock layer is weakened and an opening is created. The expansion of bubbles then causes a forceful thrust of water toward the surface. Cold-water geysers are rarer than other types of geysers, and they are only present in the US, Germany, Slovakia, and Brazil.\n\n(7). In addition to Earth, Geyser-like projections have also been observed in other places in the Solar System. Cryogeysers are characterized by the absence of liquid and the low boiling point of the ejected material, made of ice particles or dust. It is believed that a complex process called “ tidal heating ” provides the thermal energy in cryogersers. Eruptions consisting of water vapor, ice particles, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrocarbons have been observed in the south polar region of Saturn’s moon, Enceladus. Similarly, water vapor plumes have been detected by the Hubble Space Telescope over the south polar region of Europa , one of Jupiter’s moons. Moreover, eruptions on Triton, a moon of Neptune, have been detected by satellite images. Scientists identified the plumes based on the dark spots, which represent invisible streams of gaseous nitrogen with dust.\n\n(8). On Earth, geysers harbor life for thermophilic prokaryotes , which thrive in extremely hot environments. The 1960s marked the first time in history when geysers became an interest in the scientific community; at the time, it was believed that no living creature could survive above 73° C, because this was assumed to be the limit at which protein and DNA structure would begin to deteriorate. However, it was later discovered that thermophiles prefer temperatures from 50° to 70° C, while hyperthermophiles operate more efficiently in temperatures ranging from 80° to 110° C. The heat-stable enzymes of these prokaryotes have been extracted and modified to create tools related to antibiotics, plastics, and detergents , while some of the most important applications of the thermophilic enzymes today occur in the fields of medicine and biotechnology. The first of this kind is Thermus Aquaticus , which is critical to the process of PCR amplification; these prokaryotes are also responsible for the colorful displays sometimes witnessed during a geyser eruption. Photosynthetic activity of the cyanobacteria, which use carotenoids that are colored orange, yellow and red, rather than the typical green pigments of chlorophyll, is the underlying cause of this graphic (it should be noted that the abovementioned color phenomenon is much more common in hot springs).\n\n(9). The conditions that support geysers rarely occur together – thus, they are only present in a few places on Earth. The greatest aggregation of geysers is in Yellowstone National Park, where half of the world’s geysers reside, along with thousands of hot springs. The next highest concentration occurs in Russia’s “Valley of Geysers ,” which is home to approximately 200 geysers . Vigorous volcanic activity is largely responsible for the formation of the area and the eruptions in The Valley occur at a peculiar angle, a feature that is as strange as it is exclusive.\n\n(10). The largest geyser ever known, “ Waimangu ,” was in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of New Zealand. Studies show the crust below this geyser was 5-kilometer-thick, and further bolstered by a magma film beneath that stretched 50 km wide and 160 km long. Eruptions of this natural wonder would typically reach 160 metres, and some super bursts are known to have reached 500 m. However, four years after it began erupting, the water table was disrupted by a landslide and its function seized. Unfortunately, many more of the geysers in New Zealand have been destroyed by human activity within the past century.\n\n(11). Geysers are quite sensitive to changes in environmental conditions . For example, a minimal adjustment such as a loose rock structure could lead to the erosion of channels and destruction of nascent geysers. Geysers can also go extinct simply by debris being thrown into them by people, or via the draining of their water reservoir by geothermal water plants for energy production. Less frequently, they cycle through periods of dormancy and activity, as is the case with The Geysir in Iceland .\n\n(12). As incredible and uncommon as they are, geysers should be a point of protection for environmentalists . On the 15th of September 2018, one of the geysers in Yellowstone national park exploded, releasing hundreds of coins and other man-made garbage, some of which were identified to be almost 100 years old by park officials. Amongst historical coins, the eruption of Ear Spring geyser revealed plastic cups, cigarette butts, old aluminum cans, and a broken bottle . The park officials also reported increasing hydrothermal activity in Geyser Hill, which could ultimately lead to a small explosion. Beyond damaging their ecosystem , trashing geysers could have direct health risks for tourists because of exploding debris. For these reasons and more, it would be a great disservice to humanity and nature to damage these remarkable structures."

      "text": "(1). Volcanoes have cultivated the geological landscape of Earth for an extremely long time. They have been around for multiple extinction events, shaping the environment of Earth for the evolution of life, from dinosaurs to humans. One of the most breathtaking outcomes of volcanic activity is geysers; the magma of the volcanoes plays an integral part in building the pressure force that invigorates geyser eruptions. Geysers are gaps on Earth’s surface that release superheated columns of steam and water , in some instances reaching a greater height than even the CN tower. With stable conditions, they can last for a few thousand years, yet the circumstances that support geyser formation are limited on Earth, which makes them a rare phenomenon. For this reason, the implementation of preservation systems in volcanic areas containing geysers can prove beneficial. The largest concentration of geysers on Earth is in Yellowstone National Park , which is also home to thousands of hot springs and the oldest volcano chain in North America.\n\n(2). Geyser formation depends on several key requirements. Water is stored in a reservoir, the starting point of an intricate plumbing system, which includes a series of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and cavities. The inner walls of the plumbing system are tightly coated with geyserite , a mineral composed mostly of silicon dioxide that acts like cement to reinforce the geyser’s structural integrity. Magma is another vital component, supplying constant heat to the water in the reservoir. A difference in temperature between the water underneath and the water near the surface leads to an accumulation of pressure, causing the geyser to erupt.\n\n(3). Water seeping underground and encountering rocks heated by magma initiates the eruption process . The heated water expands, lowers in density, and rises to the surface through porous and fractured rocks. As the geyser fills, the water at the top of the column cools, but the remaining water in the reservoir maintains its high temperature, as heat does not transfer in the narrow channels. The cooler water presses down on the hot water beneath, like the lid of a pressure cooker, causing its temperature to increase above the standard-pressure boiling point in a process called “ superheating .” The combination of high temperature and pressure forces the steam bubbles to climb to the top of the column; the bubbles then burst through the geyser’s vent, spewing out water and lowering the weight, thus also lowering the pressure on the water below. Shortly after, the superheated water turns into steam and violently boils throughout the column. The steam and hot water then combine to form a froth that explodes out of the geyser vent.\n\n(4). Geyserite acts as insurance for geyser activity because it blocks pressure from escaping the channels and damaging the surrounding framework. Geyserite also minimizes the exposure of the loose gravel and soil underneath the geyser to immense pressure. Overall, it maintains a secure environment for the geyser to properly continue its function. Eruption ends when the remaining water in the geyser cools back down to below boiling point. The duration of eruption and time between consecutive eruptions fluctuates from one geyser to another; for instance, Strokkur in Iceland erupts every few seconds to every few minutes , while Grand Geyser in the US erupts for 10 minutes every 8-12 hours .\n\n(5).

This tells us that the author wants environmentalists to act, so they are eager to relay the message of the preservation of geysers. “As incredible and uncommon as they are, geysers should be a point of protection for environmentalists.” The author cares for these structures and wants them to be protected. Moreover, in the last sentence of paragraph 12, the statement demonstrates the author’s care, appreciation, and respect for geysers. As the author only urges that people act in the first sentences of paragraph 12, they are more reverent than adamant about geyser preservation. If their attitude were adamant, there would be multiple phrases where the author stresses geyser protection. “Beyond damaging their ecosystem, trashing geysers could have direct health risks for tourists because of exploding debris. For these reasons and more, it would be a great disservice to humanity and nature to damage these remarkable structures.” Thus, we can say that the author’s attitude regarding geyser preservation is reverent . Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Curious – is incorrect because this means the author was inquisitive and wanted to learn more. Instead, the author clearly seems knowledgeable about the subject matter, as they argue for environmentalists to act and wants geysers to be protected. Option C. Skeptical – is incorrect because this means not easily convinced or having doubts or reservations. This is not the best word, since the author is not discussing someone else’s idea, but presenting their own regarding how they want environmentalists to act to protect geysers. Option D. Biased – is incorrect because this means unfairly prejudiced. This is not the best word, since the author is stating their opinion but doesn’t give any indication that they are prejudiced against or in favour of one party.",

      "text": "(1). Volcanoes have cultivated the geological landscape of Earth for an extremely long time. They have been around for multiple extinction events, shaping the environment of Earth for the evolution of life, from dinosaurs to humans. One of the most breathtaking outcomes of volcanic activity is geysers; the magma of the volcanoes plays an integral part in building the pressure force that invigorates geyser eruptions. Geysers are gaps on Earth’s surface that release superheated columns of steam and water , in some instances reaching a greater height than even the CN tower. With stable conditions, they can last for a few thousand years, yet the circumstances that support geyser formation are limited on Earth, which makes them a rare phenomenon. For this reason, the implementation of preservation systems in volcanic areas containing geysers can prove beneficial. The largest concentration of geysers on Earth is in Yellowstone National Park , which is also home to thousands of hot springs and the oldest volcano chain in North America.\n\n(2). Geyser formation depends on several key requirements. Water is stored in a reservoir, the starting point of an intricate plumbing system, which includes a series of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and cavities. The inner walls of the plumbing system are tightly coated with geyserite , a mineral composed mostly of silicon dioxide that acts like cement to reinforce the geyser’s structural integrity. Magma is another vital component, supplying constant heat to the water in the reservoir. A difference in temperature between the water underneath and the water near the surface leads to an accumulation of pressure, causing the geyser to erupt.\n\n(3). Water seeping underground and encountering rocks heated by magma initiates the eruption process . The heated water expands, lowers in density, and rises to the surface through porous and fractured rocks. As the geyser fills, the water at the top of the column cools, but the remaining water in the reservoir maintains its high temperature, as heat does not transfer in the narrow channels. The cooler water presses down on the hot water beneath, like the lid of a pressure cooker, causing its temperature to increase above the standard-pressure boiling point in a process called “ superheating .” The combination of high temperature and pressure forces the steam bubbles to climb to the top of the column; the bubbles then burst through the geyser’s vent, spewing out water and lowering the weight, thus also lowering the pressure on the water below. Shortly after, the superheated water turns into steam and violently boils throughout the column. The steam and hot water then combine to form a froth that explodes out of the geyser vent.\n\n(4). Geyserite acts as insurance for geyser activity because it blocks pressure from escaping the channels and damaging the surrounding framework. Geyserite also minimizes the exposure of the loose gravel and soil underneath the geyser to immense pressure. Overall, it maintains a secure environment for the geyser to properly continue its function. Eruption ends when the remaining water in the geyser cools back down to below boiling point. The duration of eruption and time between consecutive eruptions fluctuates from one geyser to another; for instance, Strokkur in Iceland erupts every few seconds to every few minutes , while Grand Geyser in the US erupts for 10 minutes every 8-12 hours .\n\n(5). Geysers are generally categorized as either steam-driven or cold-water . Steam-driven geysers consist of the fountain and cone types, brief and intense outbursts characterize fountain geysers , while cone geysers are composed of mounds of minerals erupting in steady jets lasting from a few minutes to more than an hour . Yellowstone National Park contains examples of both steam-driven and cold-water geysers and is known for its abundant geothermal features. Old Faithful is a cone geyser , possibly the best-known geyser in the world. On the other hand, the tallest predictable geyser on Earth is a fountain geyser named Grand Geyser .\n\n(6). Cold-water geysers are driven by the collection of CO 2 in underground lakes called aquifers . The weight of the water above contains the pressure of the CO 2 bubbles until the exterior rock layer is weakened and an opening is created. The expansion of bubbles then causes a forceful thrust of water toward the surface. Cold-water geysers are rarer than other types of geysers, and they are only present in the US, Germany, Slovakia, and Brazil.\n\n(7). In addition to Earth, Geyser-like projections have also been observed in other places in the Solar System. Cryogeysers are characterized by the absence of liquid and the low boiling point of the ejected material, made of ice particles or dust. It is believed that a complex process called “ tidal heating ” provides the thermal energy in cryogersers. Eruptions consisting of water vapor, ice particles, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrocarbons have been observed in the south polar region of Saturn’s moon, Enceladus. Similarly, water vapor plumes have been detected by the Hubble Space Telescope over the south polar region of Europa , one of Jupiter’s moons. Moreover, eruptions on Triton, a moon of Neptune, have been detected by satellite images. Scientists identified the plumes based on the dark spots, which represent invisible streams of gaseous nitrogen with dust.\n\n(8). On Earth, geysers harbor life for thermophilic prokaryotes , which thrive in extremely hot environments. The 1960s marked the first time in history when geysers became an interest in the scientific community; at the time, it was believed that no living creature could survive above 73° C, because this was assumed to be the limit at which protein and DNA structure would begin to deteriorate. However, it was later discovered that thermophiles prefer temperatures from 50° to 70° C, while hyperthermophiles operate more efficiently in temperatures ranging from 80° to 110° C. The heat-stable enzymes of these prokaryotes have been extracted and modified to create tools related to antibiotics, plastics, and detergents , while some of the most important applications of the thermophilic enzymes today occur in the fields of medicine and biotechnology. The first of this kind is Thermus Aquaticus , which is critical to the process of PCR amplification; these prokaryotes are also responsible for the colorful displays sometimes witnessed during a geyser eruption. Photosynthetic activity of the cyanobacteria, which use carotenoids that are colored orange, yellow and red, rather than the typical green pigments of chlorophyll, is the underlying cause of this graphic (it should be noted that the abovementioned color phenomenon is much more common in hot springs).\n\n(9). The conditions that support geysers rarely occur together – thus, they are only present in a few places on Earth. The greatest aggregation of geysers is in Yellowstone National Park, where half of the world’s geysers reside, along with thousands of hot springs. The next highest concentration occurs in Russia’s “Valley of Geysers ,” which is home to approximately 200 geysers . Vigorous volcanic activity is largely responsible for the formation of the area and the eruptions in The Valley occur at a peculiar angle, a feature that is as strange as it is exclusive.\n\n(10). The largest geyser ever known, “ Waimangu ,” was in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of New Zealand. Studies show the crust below this geyser was 5-kilometer-thick, and further bolstered by a magma film beneath that stretched 50 km wide and 160 km long. Eruptions of this natural wonder would typically reach 160 metres, and some super bursts are known to have reached 500 m. However, four years after it began erupting, the water table was disrupted by a landslide and its function seized. Unfortunately, many more of the geysers in New Zealand have been destroyed by human activity within the past century.\n\n(11). Geysers are quite sensitive to changes in environmental conditions . For example, a minimal adjustment such as a loose rock structure could lead to the erosion of channels and destruction of nascent geysers. Geysers can also go extinct simply by debris being thrown into them by people, or via the draining of their water reservoir by geothermal water plants for energy production. Less frequently, they cycle through periods of dormancy and activity, as is the case with The Geysir in Iceland .\n\n(12). As incredible and uncommon as they are, geysers should be a point of protection for environmentalists . On the 15th of September 2018, one of the geysers in Yellowstone national park exploded, releasing hundreds of coins and other man-made garbage, some of which were identified to be almost 100 years old by park officials. Amongst historical coins, the eruption of Ear Spring geyser revealed plastic cups, cigarette butts, old aluminum cans, and a broken bottle . The park officials also reported increasing hydrothermal activity in Geyser Hill, which could ultimately lead to a small explosion. Beyond damaging their ecosystem , trashing geysers could have direct health risks for tourists because of exploding debris. For these reasons and more, it would be a great disservice to humanity and nature to damage these remarkable structures."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should first note that the stem refers to the public’s interaction with geysers. Therefore, to ascertain the author’s opinion on this topic, we should search the passage for the paragraph or paragraphs covering the problems associated with human presence and geysers. In paragraph 11, the author mentions the statement below. This suggests that geysers can be immensely influenced by the external interference of negligent individuals. It reads: “Geysers can also go extinct simply by debris being thrown into them by people, or via the draining of their water reservoir by geothermal water plants for energy production.” Next, in paragraph twelve, the author mentions the statement below. This example proves that geysers are potentially deadly and dangerous, made more so because of the trash people have deposited in them. It reads: “On the 15th of September 2018, one of the geysers in Yellowstone national park exploded, releasing hundreds of coins and other man-made garbage, some of which was identified to be almost 100 years old by park officials. Amongst historical coins, the eruption of Ear Spring geyser revealed plastic cups, cigarette butts, old aluminum cans, and a broken bottle. The park officials also reported increasing hydrothermal activity in the Geyser Hill, which could ultimately lead to a small explosion.” Paragraphs 11 and 12 support the findings of the study referenced in the stem, which states that geysers in Yellowstone should be avoided. The author’s personal feelings about geyser protection also come into play when choosing the right answer; in the final lines of paragraph 12, they make it clear that geysers should be protected, for the sake of nature and people: “Beyond damaging their ecosystem, trashing geysers could have direct health risks for tourists because of exploding debris. For these reasons and more, would be a great disservice to humanity and nature to damage these remarkable structures.” This tells us the author believes that ongoing change would result from altering the regulations regarding geyser protection. Therefore, Option E is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. They would dismiss the article due to its lack of basis in solid evidence – is incorrect because there is nothing in the passage that suggests this. The question stem doesn’t hint at the article not being scientifically valid – thus, this is not the best choice. Option B. They would urge investigators to explore further resources and publish another study – is incorrect because there is nothing in the passage that suggests this. The author mentions that geysers are dangerous several times, thus this would be a known scientific idea. Based on this, they wouldn’t suggest further research, but rather implement more regulations at Yellowstone to put the research into action. Option C. They would not have a reaction – is incorrect because the author clearly has an opinion on this matter. In paragraph 12, the author provides an example of how geysers can be dangerous when filled with debris; based on this, they would suggest the implementation of regulations to avoid such disasters and protect geysers. Option D. They would agree with study, and suggest the park temporarily close – is incorrect because, while they would agree, there is nothing in the passage that hints at the author wanting parks to close. Instead, they urge that geysers should be protected, not abandoned, because of their key role.",

      "text": "(1). Humans are indisputably the most intellectual species in existence, that we know of. Yet, despite the staggering rate of progression in technology and science, some mysteries continue to perplex us. The mechanism of the placebo effect as it relates to the power of the mind is a fascinating investigation.\n\n(2). The term “placebo” effect was coined in the 1700s when troubled patients were given sugar pills, water injections, or sham surgeries because the original drug was unavailable. Doctors administered makeshift treatments to placate their patients; and that is exactly what they got and much more. The word placebo has the Latin meaning of “I shall please ”. Doctors noted the potency of this strange effect as it would transmute seemingly incurable diseases into an afterthought. Ever since its conception, scientists have been trying to piece together the placebo puzzle. The potential magnitude of the placebo effect is often overlooked, but medical literature is filled with stories that bolster its power. There are two stories that are popularly cited.\n\n(3). The first is of a Mr. Wright in 1957 who was diagnosed with advanced lymphosarcoma. It is reported that he had a tumor the size of an orange in his throat, not to mention progressive failure of some vital organs such as the kidney. At the time, there was a wonder drug undergoing safety testing that promised to alleviate cancer symptoms. Mr. Wright had heard about this drug and doggedly nagged his doctor to get him this otherworldly cure. Since the actual drug was only available for research purposes, Mr. Wright’s doctor administered a needle filled with distilled water to Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright’s condition was so abysmal that his doctor did not expect him to survive the weekend. However, a couple of days later Mr. Wright was walking around the hospital with tumors half their original size . But shortly after, a reputable journal put out a study discrediting the efficacy of the wonder drug and Mr. Wright became depressed . This was followed by the return of a malicious cancer. In another attempt to save his patient, the doctor pretended to have procured an extremely pure version of the wonder drug and injected Mr. Wright with distilled water once again. For another two months, Mr. Wright was feeling great backed by physiological tests. But again, a nation-wide study was published that irrevocably disproved the abilities of the wonder drug. Two days after this news, Mr. Wright passed away.\n\n(4). The other story involves the placebo’s opposite effect, the nocebo effect, with fairy-tale-like incredulity. Sometime in the mid 1900s, three Floridan triplets were hexed by the midwife to die before their 16 th , 21 st and 23 rd birthdays. As the story goes, the first of the triplets died a day before her 16 th . The second died a day before her 21 st . The third, haunted by the clairvoyance of the hex, went to the hospital the day before her 23 rd birthday in a state of hyperventilation . She asked the medical staff to keep her safe from her looming doom. The hospital’s efforts proved futile as she died that night.\n\n(5). Clearly the placebo effect has intense physiological impacts, and the copious accounts of its consequences are found in the world’s most reputable medical journals. As the research from the past few decades indicates, the placebo is the result of a psychosomatic response to self and the environment . Essentially, the phenomenon is rooted in the central nervous system and human psychology. The brain communicates with the body through neurotransmitters and hormones . Any change in the state of consciousness is reflected in the body, whether positive or negative.\n\n(6). There are two prominent ways by which the placebo effect impacts the body . The first is through the self-induced stress and relaxation responses . When we are stressed the sympathetic nervous system is activated. Our most primitive brain structure, the brainstem, which includes the amygdala and hypothalamus, releases chemicals such as adrenaline for a fight-or-flight response. Heart rate shoots up, blood pressure increases, and inflammatory signals are activated. Interestingly, the more the brainstem gets activated by stress, the more responsive it becomes to perceived “threats”.\n\n(7). Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system modulates the relaxation response. The most familiar example is when we eat a large meal , and the body shifts its focus to metabolising the content and deriving its nutrients. As a result, digestive enzymes are activated, heart rate slows, and the body shifts into a relaxed state of metabolization. Relaxation can be thought of as the recovery essential for sustained optimal performance. The relaxation response can also be activated through other means such as nature walks and yoga.\n\n(8). The placebo effect is the mind hijacking the body’s evolutionary response to stress . A person’s negative thoughts can trigger the stress response while positive thoughts can induce relaxation. Thus, when a patient believes in the curative capacity of a fake drug, their positive emotional state leads to a relaxation response and salubrious physiological outcomes. But if a patient is told that their cancer is terminal or incurable, the label evolves into a disempowering emotional loop which triggers a stress response whenever the thought occurs. Indeed, this nocebo effect is what plagued the third triplet as she was demanding more oxygen from her body than could be supplied.\n\n(9). The nature of the doctor-patient relationship has also been shown to have a noticeable effect. It appears that the empathetic care of a doctor towards their patient can elicit the release of oxytocin , commonly known as the “love” chemical. The physiological benefits of oxytocin are endless: this is an evolutionary development to ensure humans stick together for survival, copulation, and advancement. Oppositely, loneliness , the paucity of oxytocin in one’s physiology, has been shown to have more profound consequences on critical health aspects like heart disease than smoking or exercise. Ultimately, it seems that a patient’s positive attitude and their rapport with their tender doctor is what triggers the sanguine effects of placebo.\n\n(10). This all seems too mystical to be true, you may think. But as enthralling as the mind is, scientists have been documenting its healing powers for decades. The Institute of Noetic Scientists has been tracking the occurrence of parapsychological phenomena since 1973 . Their mission is to study psychic phenomena and consciousness. They hold the most extensive database of patients who have recovered from extremely unfavorable odds in The Spontaneous Remission Bibliography Project . This project has tracked the miraculous recovery of people from incurable diseases such as stage IV cancer, HIV, heart diseases, and thyroid disease. Further, the presence of positive emotional states has a robust connection to a higher life span, improved cognitive ability, and an increased degree of life satisfaction as indicated by a plethora of medical studies.\n\n(11). Aside from its physical advantages, the placebo effect has also proven useful in clinical trials . Especially when a new version of a drug needs to be tested against the old, placebo drugs are provided to the control group to see if the new drug is indeed an improvement over its predecessor . Although it is possible for the placebo drug to cloud these results as well, so it becomes vital to repeat such experiments and compare outcomes multiple times.\n\n(12). Although the placebo effect has been proven to be transitory by countless research projects, people’s wrongful idea of it may lead to issues. They might abandon real drugs that have proven results and opt to stick with the hope that the fake drug will keep working. Regardless, as it has been elucidated by the medical literature, doctors are a key clog in the placebo chain of effects. Their job is to not only provide a caring service, but to ensure that their patients are fully aware of the evanescence of the placebo effect. Optimism in the face of delivering tough news also emerges as an integral aspect of healthcare. Healthcare professionals must be vigilant with their words because what their patients believe, they manifest."

Option B.

Mr. Wright had heard about this drug and doggedly nagged his doctor to get him this otherworldly cure.

Loneliness – is incorrect because although the author mentions that “…loneliness […] has been shown to have more profound consequences on critical health aspects like heart disease than smoking or exercise.” (Paragraph 7), the author also discusses the debilitating effects of stress in paragraph 6 by stating that “…brainstem, which includes the amygdala and hypothalamus, releases chemicals such as adrenaline for a fight-or-flight response. Heart rate shoots up, blood pressure increases, and inflammatory signals are activated.” Given this information, we cannot conclude if loneliness is more harmful to health than chronic stress. As such, we cannot conclude which single factor is MOST harmful to health. Option C. The nocebo effect – is incorrect because paragraph 8 describes the nocebo effect as when “…a patient is told that their cancer is terminal or incurable, the label evolves into a disempowering emotional loop which triggers a stress response whenever the thought occurs.” Although the nocebo effect is stated to have effects on a person’s health, the author never characterizes this effect as the most harmful. Rather, the author also states other factors such as loneliness (in paragraph 7) and stress (in paragraph 6) as significant factors that affect health. As such, we cannot conclude which single factor is MOST harmful to health. Option D. Excessive smoking and lack of exercise – is incorrect because in paragraph 7, the author states that loneliness: “…the paucity of oxytocin in one’s physiology, has been shown to have more profound consequences on critical health aspects like heart disease than smoking or exercise.” Since loneliness has MORE debilitating effects on health than smoking and lack of exercise, this option cannot be correct.",

Yet, despite the staggering rate of progression in technology and science, some mysteries continue to perplex us. The mechanism of the placebo effect as it relates to the power of the mind is a fascinating investigation.\n\n(2). The term “placebo” effect was coined in the 1700s when troubled patients were given sugar pills, water injections, or sham surgeries because the original drug was unavailable. Doctors administered makeshift treatments to placate their patients; and that is exactly what they got and much more. The word placebo has the Latin meaning of “I shall please ”. Doctors noted the potency of this strange effect as it would transmute seemingly incurable diseases into an afterthought. Ever since its conception, scientists have been trying to piece together the placebo puzzle. The potential magnitude of the placebo effect is often overlooked, but medical literature is filled with stories that bolster its power. There are two stories that are popularly cited.\n\n(3). The first is of a Mr. Wright in 1957 who was diagnosed with advanced lymphosarcoma. It is reported that he had a tumor the size of an orange in his throat, not to mention progressive failure of some vital organs such as the kidney. At the time, there was a wonder drug undergoing safety testing that promised to alleviate cancer symptoms. Mr. Wright had heard about this drug and doggedly nagged his doctor to get him this otherworldly cure. Since the actual drug was only available for research purposes, Mr. Wright’s doctor administered a needle filled with distilled water to Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright’s condition was so abysmal that his doctor did not expect him to survive the weekend. However, a couple of days later Mr. Wright was walking around the hospital with tumors half their original size . But shortly after, a reputable journal put out a study discrediting the efficacy of the wonder drug and Mr. Wright became depressed . This was followed by the return of a malicious cancer. In another attempt to save his patient, the doctor pretended to have procured an extremely pure version of the wonder drug and injected Mr. Wright with distilled water once again. For another two months, Mr. Wright was feeling great backed by physiological tests. But again, a nation-wide study was published that irrevocably disproved the abilities of the wonder drug. Two days after this news, Mr. Wright passed away.\n\n(4). The other story involves the placebo’s opposite effect, the nocebo effect, with fairy-tale-like incredulity. Sometime in the mid 1900s, three Floridan triplets were hexed by the midwife to die before their 16 th , 21 st and 23 rd birthdays. As the story goes, the first of the triplets died a day before her 16 th . The second died a day before her 21 st . The third, haunted by the clairvoyance of the hex, went to the hospital the day before her 23 rd birthday in a state of hyperventilation . She asked the medical staff to keep her safe from her looming doom. The hospital’s efforts proved futile as she died that night.\n\n(5). Clearly the placebo effect has intense physiological impacts, and the copious accounts of its consequences are found in the world’s most reputable medical journals. As the research from the past few decades indicates, the placebo is the result of a psychosomatic response to self and the environment . Essentially, the phenomenon is rooted in the central nervous system and human psychology. The brain communicates with the body through neurotransmitters and hormones . Any change in the state of consciousness is reflected in the body, whether positive or negative.\n\n(6). There are two prominent ways by which the placebo effect impacts the body . The first is through the self-induced stress and relaxation responses . When we are stressed the sympathetic nervous system is activated. Our most primitive brain structure, the brainstem, which includes the amygdala and hypothalamus, releases chemicals such as adrenaline for a fight-or-flight response. Heart rate shoots up, blood pressure increases, and inflammatory signals are activated. Interestingly, the more the brainstem gets activated by stress, the more responsive it becomes to perceived “threats”.\n\n(7). Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system modulates the relaxation response. The most familiar example is when we eat a large meal , and the body shifts its focus to metabolising the content and deriving its nutrients. As a result, digestive enzymes are activated, heart rate slows, and the body shifts into a relaxed state of metabolization. Relaxation can be thought of as the recovery essential for sustained optimal performance. The relaxation response can also be activated through other means such as nature walks and yoga.\n\n(8). The placebo effect is the mind hijacking the body’s evolutionary response to stress . A person’s negative thoughts can trigger the stress response while positive thoughts can induce relaxation. Thus, when a patient believes in the curative capacity of a fake drug, their positive emotional state leads to a relaxation response and salubrious physiological outcomes. But if a patient is told that their cancer is terminal or incurable, the label evolves into a disempowering emotional loop which triggers a stress response whenever the thought occurs. Indeed, this nocebo effect is what plagued the third triplet as she was demanding more oxygen from her body than could be supplied.\n\n(9). The nature of the doctor-patient relationship has also been shown to have a noticeable effect. It appears that the empathetic care of a doctor towards their patient can elicit the release of oxytocin , commonly known as the “love” chemical. The physiological benefits of oxytocin are endless: this is an evolutionary development to ensure humans stick together for survival, copulation, and advancement. Oppositely, loneliness , the paucity of oxytocin in one’s physiology, has been shown to have more profound consequences on critical health aspects like heart disease than smoking or exercise. Ultimately, it seems that a patient’s positive attitude and their rapport with their tender doctor is what triggers the sanguine effects of placebo.\n\n(10). This all seems too mystical to be true, you may think. But as enthralling as the mind is, scientists have been documenting its healing powers for decades. The Institute of Noetic Scientists has been tracking the occurrence of parapsychological phenomena since 1973 . Their mission is to study psychic phenomena and consciousness. They hold the most extensive database of patients who have recovered from extremely unfavorable odds in The Spontaneous Remission Bibliography Project . This project has tracked the miraculous recovery of people from incurable diseases such as stage IV cancer, HIV, heart diseases, and thyroid disease. Further, the presence of positive emotional states has a robust connection to a higher life span, improved cognitive ability, and an increased degree of life satisfaction as indicated by a plethora of medical studies.\n\n(11). Aside from its physical advantages, the placebo effect has also proven useful in clinical trials . Especially when a new version of a drug needs to be tested against the old, placebo drugs are provided to the control group to see if the new drug is indeed an improvement over its predecessor . Although it is possible for the placebo drug to cloud these results as well, so it becomes vital to repeat such experiments and compare outcomes multiple times.\n\n(12). Although the placebo effect has been proven to be transitory by countless research projects, people’s wrongful idea of it may lead to issues. They might abandon real drugs that have proven results and opt to stick with the hope that the fake drug will keep working. Regardless, as it has been elucidated by the medical literature, doctors are a key clog in the placebo chain of effects. Their job is to not only provide a caring service, but to ensure that their patients are fully aware of the evanescence of the placebo effect. Optimism in the face of delivering tough news also emerges as an integral aspect of healthcare. Healthcare professionals must be vigilant with their words because what their patients believe, they manifest."

      "concept_text": "In paragraphs 1 to 4, the author introduces the placebo effect. They then go on to discuss the effects of the placebo phenomenon on the mind and body in paragraphs 5 to 8. Paragraph 9 highlights the importance of the doctor-patient relationship in mediating the placebo effect, while paragraphs 10-12 mention the practical implications of this phenomenon. As such, the author more than just describes the placebo effect, rather, they delve deeper into the mechanisms by which it works and its applications. A significant application is the effects of the placebo phenomenon in the healthcare domain. This is best evidenced by the last sentence in the passage: “Healthcare professional must be vigilant with their words because what their patients believe, they manifest.” Hence, by weaving all these details into a story and using a narrative tone, the author describes the placebo phenomenon and effectively delivers the message of providing more holistic care. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Argumentative – is incorrect because although the author does make the argument about providing holistic health by contending that “Healthcare professionals must be vigilant with their words because what their patients believe, they manifest” (Paragraph 12), this argument is not the basis of the entire passage. Rather, the passage is about describing the placebo effect, the mechanisms by which it works, and its applications in health and research. The author does not actively argue for anything specific but rather discusses these aspects of the placebo effect in a narrative-like manner. Thus, the author’s tone is narrative rather than argumentative. Option B. Decisive – is incorrect because the author is not taking a solid stance against or for something throughout the passage. Rather, the passage is about describing the placebo effect, the mechanisms by which it works, and its applications in health and research. The author does not actively stand for anything specific but rather discusses these aspects of the placebo effect in a narrative-like manner. Thus, the author’s tone is narrative rather than decisive. Option D. Derisive – is incorrect because derisive means sarcastic; however, the author does not sarcastically discuss the placebo effect. Rather, the passage is about describing the placebo effect, the mechanisms by which it works, and its applications in health and research in a narrative-like manner. Option E. Exalting – is incorrect because exalting means praising; however, the author does not praise anything or anyone. Rather, the passage is about describing the placebo effect, the mechanisms by which it works, and its applications in health and research in a narrative-like manner.",

The question, however, presents a scenario where the boy is barely relaxing. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",

However, when discussing optimal performance in paragraph 7, the author states that “Relaxation can be thought of as the recovery essential for sustained optimal performance.” Hence, given passage evidence, the child needed relaxation, NOT emotional support, in order to perform optimally. Option C. Lack of proper nutrition – is incorrect because the scenario presented in the question states that the child spent time eating. There is nothing to suggest that what the child was eating was not nutritious. Hence, we cannot conclude that the child lacked nutrition. Option D. Lack of spaced repetition – is incorrect because the author does not discuss the effects of spaced repetition in the passage. However, when discussing optimal performance in paragraph 7, the author states that “Relaxation can be thought of as the recovery essential for sustained optimal performance.” Hence, given passage evidence, the child needed relaxation, NOT spaced repetition, in order to perform optimally. Option E. Lack of mental toughness – is incorrect because although the passage highlights the effects of the mind on a person’s health, there is no discussion on “mental toughness” in regards to one’s performance. However, when discussing optimal performance in paragraph 7, the author states that “Relaxation can be thought of as the recovery essential for sustained optimal performance.” Hence, given passage evidence, the child needed relaxation, NOT mental toughness, in order to perform optimally.",

      "text": "(1). Humans are indisputably the most intellectual species in existence, that we know of. Yet, despite the staggering rate of progression in technology and science, some mysteries continue to perplex us. The mechanism of the placebo effect as it relates to the power of the mind is a fascinating investigation.\n\n(2). The term “placebo” effect was coined in the 1700s when troubled patients were given sugar pills, water injections, or sham surgeries because the original drug was unavailable. Doctors administered makeshift treatments to placate their patients; and that is exactly what they got and much more. The word placebo has the Latin meaning of “I shall please ”. Doctors noted the potency of this strange effect as it would transmute seemingly incurable diseases into an afterthought. Ever since its conception, scientists have been trying to piece together the placebo puzzle. The potential magnitude of the placebo effect is often overlooked, but medical literature is filled with stories that bolster its power. There are two stories that are popularly cited.\n\n(3). The first is of a Mr. Wright in 1957 who was diagnosed with advanced lymphosarcoma. It is reported that he had a tumor the size of an orange in his throat, not to mention progressive failure of some vital organs such as the kidney. At the time, there was a wonder drug undergoing safety testing that promised to alleviate cancer symptoms. Mr. Wright had heard about this drug and doggedly nagged his doctor to get him this otherworldly cure. Since the actual drug was only available for research purposes, Mr. Wright’s doctor administered a needle filled with distilled water to Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright’s condition was so abysmal that his doctor did not expect him to survive the weekend. However, a couple of days later Mr. Wright was walking around the hospital with tumors half their original size . But shortly after, a reputable journal put out a study discrediting the efficacy of the wonder drug and Mr. Wright became depressed . This was followed by the return of a malicious cancer. In another attempt to save his patient, the doctor pretended to have procured an extremely pure version of the wonder drug and injected Mr. Wright with distilled water once again. For another two months, Mr. Wright was feeling great backed by physiological tests. But again, a nation-wide study was published that irrevocably disproved the abilities of the wonder drug. Two days after this news, Mr. Wright passed away.\n\n(4). The other story involves the placebo’s opposite effect, the nocebo effect, with fairy-tale-like incredulity. Sometime in the mid 1900s, three Floridan triplets were hexed by the midwife to die before their 16 th , 21 st and 23 rd birthdays. As the story goes, the first of the triplets died a day before her 16 th . The second died a day before her 21 st . The third, haunted by the clairvoyance of the hex, went to the hospital the day before her 23 rd birthday in a state of hyperventilation . She asked the medical staff to keep her safe from her looming doom. The hospital’s efforts proved futile as she died that night.\n\n(5). Clearly the placebo effect has intense physiological impacts, and the copious accounts of its consequences are found in the world’s most reputable medical journals. As the research from the past few decades indicates, the placebo is the result of a psychosomatic response to self and the environment . Essentially, the phenomenon is rooted in the central nervous system and human psychology. The brain communicates with the body through neurotransmitters and hormones . Any change in the state of consciousness is reflected in the body, whether positive or negative.\n\n(6). There are two prominent ways by which the placebo effect impacts the body . The first is through the self-induced stress and relaxation responses . When we are stressed the sympathetic nervous system is activated. Our most primitive brain structure, the brainstem, which includes the amygdala and hypothalamus, releases chemicals such as adrenaline for a fight-or-flight response. Heart rate shoots up, blood pressure increases, and inflammatory signals are activated. Interestingly, the more the brainstem gets activated by stress, the more responsive it becomes to perceived “threats”.\n\n(7). Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system modulates the relaxation response. The most familiar example is when we eat a large meal , and the body shifts its focus to metabolising the content and deriving its nutrients. As a result, digestive enzymes are activated, heart rate slows, and the body shifts into a relaxed state of metabolization. Relaxation can be thought of as the recovery essential for sustained optimal performance. The relaxation response can also be activated through other means such as nature walks and yoga.\n\n(8). The placebo effect is the mind hijacking the body’s evolutionary response to stress . A person’s negative thoughts can trigger the stress response while positive thoughts can induce relaxation. Thus, when a patient believes in the curative capacity of a fake drug, their positive emotional state leads to a relaxation response and salubrious physiological outcomes. But if a patient is told that their cancer is terminal or incurable, the label evolves into a disempowering emotional loop which triggers a stress response whenever the thought occurs. Indeed, this nocebo effect is what plagued the third triplet as she was demanding more oxygen from her body than could be supplied.\n\n(9). The nature of the doctor-patient relationship has also been shown to have a noticeable effect. It appears that the empathetic care of a doctor towards their patient can elicit the release of oxytocin , commonly known as the “love” chemical. The physiological benefits of oxytocin are endless: this is an evolutionary development to ensure humans stick together for survival, copulation, and advancement. Oppositely, loneliness , the paucity of oxytocin in one’s physiology, has been shown to have more profound consequences on critical health aspects like heart disease than smoking or exercise. Ultimately, it seems that a patient’s positive attitude and their rapport with their tender doctor is what triggers the sanguine effects of placebo.\n\n(10). This all seems too mystical to be true, you may think. But as enthralling as the mind is, scientists have been documenting its healing powers for decades. The Institute of Noetic Scientists has been tracking the occurrence of parapsychological phenomena since 1973 . Their mission is to study psychic phenomena and consciousness. They hold the most extensive database of patients who have recovered from extremely unfavorable odds in The Spontaneous Remission Bibliography Project . This project has tracked the miraculous recovery of people from incurable diseases such as stage IV cancer, HIV, heart diseases, and thyroid disease. Further, the presence of positive emotional states has a robust connection to a higher life span, improved cognitive ability, and an increased degree of life satisfaction as indicated by a plethora of medical studies.\n\n(11). Aside from its physical advantages, the placebo effect has also proven useful in clinical trials . Especially when a new version of a drug needs to be tested against the old, placebo drugs are provided to the control group to see if the new drug is indeed an improvement over its predecessor . Although it is possible for the placebo drug to cloud these results as well, so it becomes vital to repeat such experiments and compare outcomes multiple times.\n\n(12).

Essentially, the phenomenon is rooted in the central nervous system and human psychology. The brain communicates with the body through neurotransmitters and hormones. Any change in the state of consciousness is reflected in the body, whether positive or negative.” Hence, it is the interaction between the psychology (mind) and the nervous system (body) that creates the placebo effect. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. The bridge between spirituality and science – is incorrect because the author discusses the interactions between the human psychology and body in paragraph 5 when they state: “…the phenomenon is rooted in the central nervous system and human psychology.” However, there is no indication that “psychology” equates to “spirituality”. Since the author never attributes the placebo effect to spirituality, this option cannot be correct. Option C. The harmonious coupling of self-relaxation and doctor’s care – is incorrect because the author describes the placebo effect as a “…phenomenon [that] is rooted in the central nervous system and human psychology.” (Paragraph 5). There is no indication in the passage that the placebo effect arises whenever an individual partakes in self-relaxation and receives doctor’s care. Notably, in paragraph 8 the author states that “The placebo effect is the mind hijacking the body’s evolutionary response to stress. A person’s negative thoughts can trigger the stress response while positive thoughts can induce relaxation.” As such, feeling relaxed due to positive thoughts is an example of the placebo effect at play. Relaxation, however, does not characterize this phenomenon because negative thoughts can result in feeling stressed – which would also be an example of the placebo effect. Option D. The absence of limiting labels – is incorrect because the author discusses limiting labels in paragraph 8 when they state that “…if a patient is told that their cancer is terminal or incurable, the label evolves into a disempowering emotional loop which triggers a stress response whenever the thought occurs.” As such, labels can be catalysts for the placebo effect, particularly the nocebo effect. However, there is no indication in the passage that the absence of limiting labels describes the placebo effect. Option E. Optimism leading to manifestation – is incorrect because in paragraph 8 the author states that “The placebo effect is the mind hijacking the body’s evolutionary response to stress. A person’s negative thoughts can trigger the stress response while positive thoughts can induce relaxation.” Evidently, thoughts can manifest feelings of relaxation or stress. However, this is an example of the placebo effect, NOT what the phenomenon is. The author describes the placebo effect as a “…phenomenon [that] is rooted in the central nervous system [i.e. the body] and human psychology [i.e. the mind].” (Paragraph 5).",

Sometime in the mid 1900s, three Floridan triplets were hexed by the midwife to die before their 16 th , 21 st and 23 rd birthdays. As the story goes, the first of the triplets died a day before her 16 th . The second died a day before her 21 st . The third, haunted by the clairvoyance of the hex, went to the hospital the day before her 23 rd birthday in a state of hyperventilation . She asked the medical staff to keep her safe from her looming doom. The hospital’s efforts proved futile as she died that night.\n\n(5).

Relaxation can be thought of as the recovery essential for sustained optimal performance. The relaxation response can also be activated through other means such as nature walks and yoga.\n\n(8). The placebo effect is the mind hijacking the body’s evolutionary response to stress . A person’s negative thoughts can trigger the stress response while positive thoughts can induce relaxation. Thus, when a patient believes in the curative capacity of a fake drug, their positive emotional state leads to a relaxation response and salubrious physiological outcomes. But if a patient is told that their cancer is terminal or incurable, the label evolves into a disempowering emotional loop which triggers a stress response whenever the thought occurs. Indeed, this nocebo effect is what plagued the third triplet as she was demanding more oxygen from her body than could be supplied.\n\n(9). The nature of the doctor-patient relationship has also been shown to have a noticeable effect. It appears that the empathetic care of a doctor towards their patient can elicit the release of oxytocin , commonly known as the “love” chemical.

      "text": "(1). Humans are indisputably the most intellectual species in existence, that we know of. Yet, despite the staggering rate of progression in technology and science, some mysteries continue to perplex us. The mechanism of the placebo effect as it relates to the power of the mind is a fascinating investigation.\n\n(2). The term “placebo” effect was coined in the 1700s when troubled patients were given sugar pills, water injections, or sham surgeries because the original drug was unavailable. Doctors administered makeshift treatments to placate their patients; and that is exactly what they got and much more. The word placebo has the Latin meaning of “I shall please ”. Doctors noted the potency of this strange effect as it would transmute seemingly incurable diseases into an afterthought. Ever since its conception, scientists have been trying to piece together the placebo puzzle. The potential magnitude of the placebo effect is often overlooked, but medical literature is filled with stories that bolster its power. There are two stories that are popularly cited.\n\n(3). The first is of a Mr. Wright in 1957 who was diagnosed with advanced lymphosarcoma. It is reported that he had a tumor the size of an orange in his throat, not to mention progressive failure of some vital organs such as the kidney. At the time, there was a wonder drug undergoing safety testing that promised to alleviate cancer symptoms. Mr. Wright had heard about this drug and doggedly nagged his doctor to get him this otherworldly cure. Since the actual drug was only available for research purposes, Mr. Wright’s doctor administered a needle filled with distilled water to Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright’s condition was so abysmal that his doctor did not expect him to survive the weekend. However, a couple of days later Mr. Wright was walking around the hospital with tumors half their original size . But shortly after, a reputable journal put out a study discrediting the efficacy of the wonder drug and Mr. Wright became depressed . This was followed by the return of a malicious cancer. In another attempt to save his patient, the doctor pretended to have procured an extremely pure version of the wonder drug and injected Mr. Wright with distilled water once again. For another two months, Mr. Wright was feeling great backed by physiological tests. But again, a nation-wide study was published that irrevocably disproved the abilities of the wonder drug. Two days after this news, Mr. Wright passed away.\n\n(4). The other story involves the placebo’s opposite effect, the nocebo effect, with fairy-tale-like incredulity. Sometime in the mid 1900s, three Floridan triplets were hexed by the midwife to die before their 16 th , 21 st and 23 rd birthdays. As the story goes, the first of the triplets died a day before her 16 th . The second died a day before her 21 st . The third, haunted by the clairvoyance of the hex, went to the hospital the day before her 23 rd birthday in a state of hyperventilation . She asked the medical staff to keep her safe from her looming doom. The hospital’s efforts proved futile as she died that night.\n\n(5). Clearly the placebo effect has intense physiological impacts, and the copious accounts of its consequences are found in the world’s most reputable medical journals. As the research from the past few decades indicates, the placebo is the result of a psychosomatic response to self and the environment . Essentially, the phenomenon is rooted in the central nervous system and human psychology. The brain communicates with the body through neurotransmitters and hormones . Any change in the state of consciousness is reflected in the body, whether positive or negative.\n\n(6). There are two prominent ways by which the placebo effect impacts the body . The first is through the self-induced stress and relaxation responses . When we are stressed the sympathetic nervous system is activated. Our most primitive brain structure, the brainstem, which includes the amygdala and hypothalamus, releases chemicals such as adrenaline for a fight-or-flight response. Heart rate shoots up, blood pressure increases, and inflammatory signals are activated. Interestingly, the more the brainstem gets activated by stress, the more responsive it becomes to perceived “threats”.\n\n(7). Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system modulates the relaxation response. The most familiar example is when we eat a large meal , and the body shifts its focus to metabolising the content and deriving its nutrients. As a result, digestive enzymes are activated, heart rate slows, and the body shifts into a relaxed state of metabolization. Relaxation can be thought of as the recovery essential for sustained optimal performance. The relaxation response can also be activated through other means such as nature walks and yoga.\n\n(8). The placebo effect is the mind hijacking the body’s evolutionary response to stress . A person’s negative thoughts can trigger the stress response while positive thoughts can induce relaxation. Thus, when a patient believes in the curative capacity of a fake drug, their positive emotional state leads to a relaxation response and salubrious physiological outcomes. But if a patient is told that their cancer is terminal or incurable, the label evolves into a disempowering emotional loop which triggers a stress response whenever the thought occurs. Indeed, this nocebo effect is what plagued the third triplet as she was demanding more oxygen from her body than could be supplied.\n\n(9). The nature of the doctor-patient relationship has also been shown to have a noticeable effect. It appears that the empathetic care of a doctor towards their patient can elicit the release of oxytocin , commonly known as the “love” chemical. The physiological benefits of oxytocin are endless: this is an evolutionary development to ensure humans stick together for survival, copulation, and advancement. Oppositely, loneliness , the paucity of oxytocin in one’s physiology, has been shown to have more profound consequences on critical health aspects like heart disease than smoking or exercise. Ultimately, it seems that a patient’s positive attitude and their rapport with their tender doctor is what triggers the sanguine effects of placebo.\n\n(10). This all seems too mystical to be true, you may think. But as enthralling as the mind is, scientists have been documenting its healing powers for decades. The Institute of Noetic Scientists has been tracking the occurrence of parapsychological phenomena since 1973 . Their mission is to study psychic phenomena and consciousness. They hold the most extensive database of patients who have recovered from extremely unfavorable odds in The Spontaneous Remission Bibliography Project . This project has tracked the miraculous recovery of people from incurable diseases such as stage IV cancer, HIV, heart diseases, and thyroid disease. Further, the presence of positive emotional states has a robust connection to a higher life span, improved cognitive ability, and an increased degree of life satisfaction as indicated by a plethora of medical studies.\n\n(11). Aside from its physical advantages, the placebo effect has also proven useful in clinical trials . Especially when a new version of a drug needs to be tested against the old, placebo drugs are provided to the control group to see if the new drug is indeed an improvement over its predecessor . Although it is possible for the placebo drug to cloud these results as well, so it becomes vital to repeat such experiments and compare outcomes multiple times.\n\n(12). Although the placebo effect has been proven to be transitory by countless research projects, people’s wrongful idea of it may lead to issues. They might abandon real drugs that have proven results and opt to stick with the hope that the fake drug will keep working. Regardless, as it has been elucidated by the medical literature, doctors are a key clog in the placebo chain of effects. Their job is to not only provide a caring service, but to ensure that their patients are fully aware of the evanescence of the placebo effect. Optimism in the face of delivering tough news also emerges as an integral aspect of healthcare. Healthcare professionals must be vigilant with their words because what their patients believe, they manifest."

Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",

In paragraph 4, the author states that “…three Floridan triplets were hexed by the midwife to die before their 16 th , 21 st and 23 rd birthdays […] The third, haunted by the clairvoyance of the hex, went to the hospital the day before her 23 rd birthday in a state of hyperventilation.

As such, there is no passage evidence to suggest that hexes result in physiological changes. Option B. The modulation of the insulin and oxytocin hormones – is incorrect because although the effect of oxytocin on the body is discussed in paragraph 9, insulin is never mentioned in the passage, making this option incorrect. Option D. The belief system of a patient and the nature of the placebo treatment – is incorrect because although a person’s beliefs are important in triggering the placebo effect, the nature of the placebo treatment is never discussed as a factor that regulates physiological responses. In fact, the author lists a few placebos in paragraph 2 when they state that “…patients were given sugar pills, water injections, or sham surgeries because the original drug was unavailable,” however, the author never discusses how the nature of these treatments regulated a person’s physiology. Option E. The support system around the patient and their belief in improvement – is incorrect because the author contends that the belief of the patient is important as “…what their patients believe, they manifest.” (Paragraph 12).

      "concept_text": "Paragraph 7 states: “Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system modulates the relaxation response. The most familiar example is when we eat a large meal , and the body shifts its focus to metabolising the content and deriving its nutrients. As a result, digestive enzymes are activated, heart rate slows, and the body shifts into a relaxed state of metabolization. Relaxation can be thought of as the recovery essential for sustained optimal performance. The relaxation response can also be activated through other means such as nature walks and yoga .” Additionally, paragraph 8 states: “A person’s negative thoughts can trigger the stress response while positive thoughts can induce relaxation.” Thus, a large meal, nature walks, yoga, and positive thoughts can all trigger the relaxation response. On the other hand, paragraph 9 states: “The nature of the doctor-patient relationship has also been shown to have a noticeable effect. It appears that the empathetic care of a doctor towards their patient can elicit the release of oxytocin, commonly known as the “love” chemical.” Hence, a caring doctor does not induce relaxation through activating the parasympathetic nervous system, rather, they induce the “love” response by releasing oxytocin. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",

      "text": "(1). Humans are indisputably the most intellectual species in existence, that we know of. Yet, despite the staggering rate of progression in technology and science, some mysteries continue to perplex us. The mechanism of the placebo effect as it relates to the power of the mind is a fascinating investigation.\n\n(2). The term “placebo” effect was coined in the 1700s when troubled patients were given sugar pills, water injections, or sham surgeries because the original drug was unavailable. Doctors administered makeshift treatments to placate their patients; and that is exactly what they got and much more. The word placebo has the Latin meaning of “I shall please ”. Doctors noted the potency of this strange effect as it would transmute seemingly incurable diseases into an afterthought. Ever since its conception, scientists have been trying to piece together the placebo puzzle. The potential magnitude of the placebo effect is often overlooked, but medical literature is filled with stories that bolster its power. There are two stories that are popularly cited.\n\n(3). The first is of a Mr. Wright in 1957 who was diagnosed with advanced lymphosarcoma. It is reported that he had a tumor the size of an orange in his throat, not to mention progressive failure of some vital organs such as the kidney. At the time, there was a wonder drug undergoing safety testing that promised to alleviate cancer symptoms. Mr. Wright had heard about this drug and doggedly nagged his doctor to get him this otherworldly cure. Since the actual drug was only available for research purposes, Mr. Wright’s doctor administered a needle filled with distilled water to Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright’s condition was so abysmal that his doctor did not expect him to survive the weekend. However, a couple of days later Mr. Wright was walking around the hospital with tumors half their original size . But shortly after, a reputable journal put out a study discrediting the efficacy of the wonder drug and Mr. Wright became depressed . This was followed by the return of a malicious cancer. In another attempt to save his patient, the doctor pretended to have procured an extremely pure version of the wonder drug and injected Mr. Wright with distilled water once again. For another two months, Mr. Wright was feeling great backed by physiological tests. But again, a nation-wide study was published that irrevocably disproved the abilities of the wonder drug. Two days after this news, Mr. Wright passed away.\n\n(4). The other story involves the placebo’s opposite effect, the nocebo effect, with fairy-tale-like incredulity. Sometime in the mid 1900s, three Floridan triplets were hexed by the midwife to die before their 16 th , 21 st and 23 rd birthdays. As the story goes, the first of the triplets died a day before her 16 th . The second died a day before her 21 st . The third, haunted by the clairvoyance of the hex, went to the hospital the day before her 23 rd birthday in a state of hyperventilation . She asked the medical staff to keep her safe from her looming doom. The hospital’s efforts proved futile as she died that night.\n\n(5). Clearly the placebo effect has intense physiological impacts, and the copious accounts of its consequences are found in the world’s most reputable medical journals. As the research from the past few decades indicates, the placebo is the result of a psychosomatic response to self and the environment . Essentially, the phenomenon is rooted in the central nervous system and human psychology. The brain communicates with the body through neurotransmitters and hormones . Any change in the state of consciousness is reflected in the body, whether positive or negative.\n\n(6). There are two prominent ways by which the placebo effect impacts the body . The first is through the self-induced stress and relaxation responses . When we are stressed the sympathetic nervous system is activated. Our most primitive brain structure, the brainstem, which includes the amygdala and hypothalamus, releases chemicals such as adrenaline for a fight-or-flight response. Heart rate shoots up, blood pressure increases, and inflammatory signals are activated. Interestingly, the more the brainstem gets activated by stress, the more responsive it becomes to perceived “threats”.\n\n(7). Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system modulates the relaxation response. The most familiar example is when we eat a large meal , and the body shifts its focus to metabolising the content and deriving its nutrients. As a result, digestive enzymes are activated, heart rate slows, and the body shifts into a relaxed state of metabolization. Relaxation can be thought of as the recovery essential for sustained optimal performance. The relaxation response can also be activated through other means such as nature walks and yoga.\n\n(8). The placebo effect is the mind hijacking the body’s evolutionary response to stress . A person’s negative thoughts can trigger the stress response while positive thoughts can induce relaxation. Thus, when a patient believes in the curative capacity of a fake drug, their positive emotional state leads to a relaxation response and salubrious physiological outcomes. But if a patient is told that their cancer is terminal or incurable, the label evolves into a disempowering emotional loop which triggers a stress response whenever the thought occurs. Indeed, this nocebo effect is what plagued the third triplet as she was demanding more oxygen from her body than could be supplied.\n\n(9). The nature of the doctor-patient relationship has also been shown to have a noticeable effect. It appears that the empathetic care of a doctor towards their patient can elicit the release of oxytocin , commonly known as the “love” chemical. The physiological benefits of oxytocin are endless: this is an evolutionary development to ensure humans stick together for survival, copulation, and advancement. Oppositely, loneliness , the paucity of oxytocin in one’s physiology, has been shown to have more profound consequences on critical health aspects like heart disease than smoking or exercise. Ultimately, it seems that a patient’s positive attitude and their rapport with their tender doctor is what triggers the sanguine effects of placebo.\n\n(10). This all seems too mystical to be true, you may think. But as enthralling as the mind is, scientists have been documenting its healing powers for decades. The Institute of Noetic Scientists has been tracking the occurrence of parapsychological phenomena since 1973 . Their mission is to study psychic phenomena and consciousness. They hold the most extensive database of patients who have recovered from extremely unfavorable odds in The Spontaneous Remission Bibliography Project . This project has tracked the miraculous recovery of people from incurable diseases such as stage IV cancer, HIV, heart diseases, and thyroid disease. Further, the presence of positive emotional states has a robust connection to a higher life span, improved cognitive ability, and an increased degree of life satisfaction as indicated by a plethora of medical studies.\n\n(11). Aside from its physical advantages, the placebo effect has also proven useful in clinical trials . Especially when a new version of a drug needs to be tested against the old, placebo drugs are provided to the control group to see if the new drug is indeed an improvement over its predecessor . Although it is possible for the placebo drug to cloud these results as well, so it becomes vital to repeat such experiments and compare outcomes multiple times.\n\n(12). Although the placebo effect has been proven to be transitory by countless research projects, people’s wrongful idea of it may lead to issues. They might abandon real drugs that have proven results and opt to stick with the hope that the fake drug will keep working. Regardless, as it has been elucidated by the medical literature, doctors are a key clog in the placebo chain of effects. Their job is to not only provide a caring service, but to ensure that their patients are fully aware of the evanescence of the placebo effect. Optimism in the face of delivering tough news also emerges as an integral aspect of healthcare. Healthcare professionals must be vigilant with their words because what their patients believe, they manifest."

      "text": "(1). Humans are indisputably the most intellectual species in existence, that we know of. Yet, despite the staggering rate of progression in technology and science, some mysteries continue to perplex us. The mechanism of the placebo effect as it relates to the power of the mind is a fascinating investigation.\n\n(2). The term “placebo” effect was coined in the 1700s when troubled patients were given sugar pills, water injections, or sham surgeries because the original drug was unavailable. Doctors administered makeshift treatments to placate their patients; and that is exactly what they got and much more. The word placebo has the Latin meaning of “I shall please ”. Doctors noted the potency of this strange effect as it would transmute seemingly incurable diseases into an afterthought. Ever since its conception, scientists have been trying to piece together the placebo puzzle. The potential magnitude of the placebo effect is often overlooked, but medical literature is filled with stories that bolster its power. There are two stories that are popularly cited.\n\n(3). The first is of a Mr. Wright in 1957 who was diagnosed with advanced lymphosarcoma. It is reported that he had a tumor the size of an orange in his throat, not to mention progressive failure of some vital organs such as the kidney. At the time, there was a wonder drug undergoing safety testing that promised to alleviate cancer symptoms. Mr. Wright had heard about this drug and doggedly nagged his doctor to get him this otherworldly cure. Since the actual drug was only available for research purposes, Mr. Wright’s doctor administered a needle filled with distilled water to Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright’s condition was so abysmal that his doctor did not expect him to survive the weekend. However, a couple of days later Mr. Wright was walking around the hospital with tumors half their original size . But shortly after, a reputable journal put out a study discrediting the efficacy of the wonder drug and Mr. Wright became depressed . This was followed by the return of a malicious cancer. In another attempt to save his patient, the doctor pretended to have procured an extremely pure version of the wonder drug and injected Mr. Wright with distilled water once again. For another two months, Mr. Wright was feeling great backed by physiological tests. But again, a nation-wide study was published that irrevocably disproved the abilities of the wonder drug. Two days after this news, Mr. Wright passed away.\n\n(4). The other story involves the placebo’s opposite effect, the nocebo effect, with fairy-tale-like incredulity. Sometime in the mid 1900s, three Floridan triplets were hexed by the midwife to die before their 16 th , 21 st and 23 rd birthdays. As the story goes, the first of the triplets died a day before her 16 th . The second died a day before her 21 st . The third, haunted by the clairvoyance of the hex, went to the hospital the day before her 23 rd birthday in a state of hyperventilation . She asked the medical staff to keep her safe from her looming doom. The hospital’s efforts proved futile as she died that night.\n\n(5). Clearly the placebo effect has intense physiological impacts, and the copious accounts of its consequences are found in the world’s most reputable medical journals. As the research from the past few decades indicates, the placebo is the result of a psychosomatic response to self and the environment . Essentially, the phenomenon is rooted in the central nervous system and human psychology. The brain communicates with the body through neurotransmitters and hormones . Any change in the state of consciousness is reflected in the body, whether positive or negative.\n\n(6). There are two prominent ways by which the placebo effect impacts the body . The first is through the self-induced stress and relaxation responses . When we are stressed the sympathetic nervous system is activated. Our most primitive brain structure, the brainstem, which includes the amygdala and hypothalamus, releases chemicals such as adrenaline for a fight-or-flight response. Heart rate shoots up, blood pressure increases, and inflammatory signals are activated. Interestingly, the more the brainstem gets activated by stress, the more responsive it becomes to perceived “threats”.\n\n(7). Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system modulates the relaxation response. The most familiar example is when we eat a large meal , and the body shifts its focus to metabolising the content and deriving its nutrients. As a result, digestive enzymes are activated, heart rate slows, and the body shifts into a relaxed state of metabolization. Relaxation can be thought of as the recovery essential for sustained optimal performance. The relaxation response can also be activated through other means such as nature walks and yoga.\n\n(8). The placebo effect is the mind hijacking the body’s evolutionary response to stress . A person’s negative thoughts can trigger the stress response while positive thoughts can induce relaxation. Thus, when a patient believes in the curative capacity of a fake drug, their positive emotional state leads to a relaxation response and salubrious physiological outcomes. But if a patient is told that their cancer is terminal or incurable, the label evolves into a disempowering emotional loop which triggers a stress response whenever the thought occurs. Indeed, this nocebo effect is what plagued the third triplet as she was demanding more oxygen from her body than could be supplied.\n\n(9). The nature of the doctor-patient relationship has also been shown to have a noticeable effect. It appears that the empathetic care of a doctor towards their patient can elicit the release of oxytocin , commonly known as the “love” chemical. The physiological benefits of oxytocin are endless: this is an evolutionary development to ensure humans stick together for survival, copulation, and advancement. Oppositely, loneliness , the paucity of oxytocin in one’s physiology, has been shown to have more profound consequences on critical health aspects like heart disease than smoking or exercise. Ultimately, it seems that a patient’s positive attitude and their rapport with their tender doctor is what triggers the sanguine effects of placebo.\n\n(10). This all seems too mystical to be true, you may think. But as enthralling as the mind is, scientists have been documenting its healing powers for decades. The Institute of Noetic Scientists has been tracking the occurrence of parapsychological phenomena since 1973 . Their mission is to study psychic phenomena and consciousness. They hold the most extensive database of patients who have recovered from extremely unfavorable odds in The Spontaneous Remission Bibliography Project . This project has tracked the miraculous recovery of people from incurable diseases such as stage IV cancer, HIV, heart diseases, and thyroid disease. Further, the presence of positive emotional states has a robust connection to a higher life span, improved cognitive ability, and an increased degree of life satisfaction as indicated by a plethora of medical studies.\n\n(11). Aside from its physical advantages, the placebo effect has also proven useful in clinical trials . Especially when a new version of a drug needs to be tested against the old, placebo drugs are provided to the control group to see if the new drug is indeed an improvement over its predecessor . Although it is possible for the placebo drug to cloud these results as well, so it becomes vital to repeat such experiments and compare outcomes multiple times.\n\n(12). Although the placebo effect has been proven to be transitory by countless research projects, people’s wrongful idea of it may lead to issues. They might abandon real drugs that have proven results and opt to stick with the hope that the fake drug will keep working. Regardless, as it has been elucidated by the medical literature, doctors are a key clog in the placebo chain of effects. Their job is to not only provide a caring service, but to ensure that their patients are fully aware of the evanescence of the placebo effect. Optimism in the face of delivering tough news also emerges as an integral aspect of healthcare. Healthcare professionals must be vigilant with their words because what their patients believe, they manifest."

      "concept_text": "Lower levels of pain (y-axis) indicate the efficacy of the short-duration pain medication. For medication A, there is a difference noted between the orally administered and the machine-administered medications. Participants who received the orally transmitted medication A reported significantly lower levels of pain, while those that received the machine-administered medication A reported the same amount of pain. This suggests that the machine-administered medication A was ineffective. The only difference between both these groups that received medication A is the fact that the participants who orally received medication A were aware of the administration. Hence, we can conclude that this awareness contributed to the pain-relieving effects of medication A. In paragraph 5 the author describes the placebo effect by stating that: “…the placebo effect has intense physiological impacts, […] Essentially, the phenomenon is rooted in the central nervous system and human psychology. The brain communicates with the body through neurotransmitters and hormones. Any change in the state of consciousness is reflected in the body, whether positive or negative.” Since the patients who orally received medication A were consciously aware of the administration, they were subjected to the placebo effect. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Medication B was subject to the placebo effect – is incorrect beucase only the patients who orally received medication B were aware of the administration. However, both the patients who received medication B orally and through the machine reported lower levels of pain. As such, the patient’s level of awareness regarding the administration of the medication did not play a role in reducing their pain. This indicates that medication B was NOT subjected to the placebo effect. Option C. Both medications were subject to the placebo effect – is incorrect because although patients who received medication A demonstrated the placebo effect, patients who received medication B did not demonstrate this phenomenon. Only the patients who orally received medication B were aware of the administration, yet both the patients who received medication B orally and through the machine reported lower levels of pain. This suggests that patient’s level of awareness regarding the administration of medication B did not play a role in reducing their pain. Hence, only medication A was subjected to the placebo effect, NOT medication B. Option D. Neither medication was subject to the placebo effect – is incorrect because although patients who received medication B did not demonstrate the placebo effect, patients who received medication A demonstrated this phenomenon. For medication A, there is a difference noted between the orally administered and the machine-administered medications. Participants who received the orally transmitted medication A reported significantly lower levels of pain, while those that received the machine-administered medication A reported the same amount of pain. The only difference between both these groups is the fact that the participants who orally received medication A were aware of the administration. Since this awareness contributed to the pain-relieving effects of medication A, this medication was subjected to the placebo phenomenon. Option E. There is insufficient data to identify which medication was subjected to the placebo effect – is incorrect because there IS enough information to determine which medication was subjected to the placebo effect. The graph for medication B shows that both the orally administered and machine-administered medication reduced pain in patients. However, for medication A, there is a difference noted between the orally administered and the machine-administered medications. Participants who received the orally transmitted medication A reported significantly lower levels of pain, while those that received the machine-administered medication A reported the same amount of pain. The only difference between both these groups is the fact that the participants who orally received medication A were aware of the administration.

      "text": "(1). Humans are indisputably the most intellectual species in existence, that we know of. Yet, despite the staggering rate of progression in technology and science, some mysteries continue to perplex us. The mechanism of the placebo effect as it relates to the power of the mind is a fascinating investigation.\n\n(2). The term “placebo” effect was coined in the 1700s when troubled patients were given sugar pills, water injections, or sham surgeries because the original drug was unavailable. Doctors administered makeshift treatments to placate their patients; and that is exactly what they got and much more. The word placebo has the Latin meaning of “I shall please ”. Doctors noted the potency of this strange effect as it would transmute seemingly incurable diseases into an afterthought. Ever since its conception, scientists have been trying to piece together the placebo puzzle. The potential magnitude of the placebo effect is often overlooked, but medical literature is filled with stories that bolster its power. There are two stories that are popularly cited.\n\n(3). The first is of a Mr. Wright in 1957 who was diagnosed with advanced lymphosarcoma. It is reported that he had a tumor the size of an orange in his throat, not to mention progressive failure of some vital organs such as the kidney. At the time, there was a wonder drug undergoing safety testing that promised to alleviate cancer symptoms. Mr. Wright had heard about this drug and doggedly nagged his doctor to get him this otherworldly cure. Since the actual drug was only available for research purposes, Mr. Wright’s doctor administered a needle filled with distilled water to Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright’s condition was so abysmal that his doctor did not expect him to survive the weekend. However, a couple of days later Mr. Wright was walking around the hospital with tumors half their original size . But shortly after, a reputable journal put out a study discrediting the efficacy of the wonder drug and Mr. Wright became depressed . This was followed by the return of a malicious cancer. In another attempt to save his patient, the doctor pretended to have procured an extremely pure version of the wonder drug and injected Mr. Wright with distilled water once again. For another two months, Mr. Wright was feeling great backed by physiological tests. But again, a nation-wide study was published that irrevocably disproved the abilities of the wonder drug. Two days after this news, Mr. Wright passed away.\n\n(4). The other story involves the placebo’s opposite effect, the nocebo effect, with fairy-tale-like incredulity. Sometime in the mid 1900s, three Floridan triplets were hexed by the midwife to die before their 16 th , 21 st and 23 rd birthdays. As the story goes, the first of the triplets died a day before her 16 th . The second died a day before her 21 st . The third, haunted by the clairvoyance of the hex, went to the hospital the day before her 23 rd birthday in a state of hyperventilation . She asked the medical staff to keep her safe from her looming doom. The hospital’s efforts proved futile as she died that night.\n\n(5). Clearly the placebo effect has intense physiological impacts, and the copious accounts of its consequences are found in the world’s most reputable medical journals. As the research from the past few decades indicates, the placebo is the result of a psychosomatic response to self and the environment . Essentially, the phenomenon is rooted in the central nervous system and human psychology. The brain communicates with the body through neurotransmitters and hormones . Any change in the state of consciousness is reflected in the body, whether positive or negative.\n\n(6). There are two prominent ways by which the placebo effect impacts the body . The first is through the self-induced stress and relaxation responses . When we are stressed the sympathetic nervous system is activated. Our most primitive brain structure, the brainstem, which includes the amygdala and hypothalamus, releases chemicals such as adrenaline for a fight-or-flight response. Heart rate shoots up, blood pressure increases, and inflammatory signals are activated. Interestingly, the more the brainstem gets activated by stress, the more responsive it becomes to perceived “threats”.\n\n(7). Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system modulates the relaxation response. The most familiar example is when we eat a large meal , and the body shifts its focus to metabolising the content and deriving its nutrients. As a result, digestive enzymes are activated, heart rate slows, and the body shifts into a relaxed state of metabolization. Relaxation can be thought of as the recovery essential for sustained optimal performance. The relaxation response can also be activated through other means such as nature walks and yoga.\n\n(8). The placebo effect is the mind hijacking the body’s evolutionary response to stress . A person’s negative thoughts can trigger the stress response while positive thoughts can induce relaxation. Thus, when a patient believes in the curative capacity of a fake drug, their positive emotional state leads to a relaxation response and salubrious physiological outcomes. But if a patient is told that their cancer is terminal or incurable, the label evolves into a disempowering emotional loop which triggers a stress response whenever the thought occurs. Indeed, this nocebo effect is what plagued the third triplet as she was demanding more oxygen from her body than could be supplied.\n\n(9). The nature of the doctor-patient relationship has also been shown to have a noticeable effect. It appears that the empathetic care of a doctor towards their patient can elicit the release of oxytocin , commonly known as the “love” chemical. The physiological benefits of oxytocin are endless: this is an evolutionary development to ensure humans stick together for survival, copulation, and advancement. Oppositely, loneliness , the paucity of oxytocin in one’s physiology, has been shown to have more profound consequences on critical health aspects like heart disease than smoking or exercise. Ultimately, it seems that a patient’s positive attitude and their rapport with their tender doctor is what triggers the sanguine effects of placebo.\n\n(10). This all seems too mystical to be true, you may think. But as enthralling as the mind is, scientists have been documenting its healing powers for decades. The Institute of Noetic Scientists has been tracking the occurrence of parapsychological phenomena since 1973 . Their mission is to study psychic phenomena and consciousness. They hold the most extensive database of patients who have recovered from extremely unfavorable odds in The Spontaneous Remission Bibliography Project . This project has tracked the miraculous recovery of people from incurable diseases such as stage IV cancer, HIV, heart diseases, and thyroid disease. Further, the presence of positive emotional states has a robust connection to a higher life span, improved cognitive ability, and an increased degree of life satisfaction as indicated by a plethora of medical studies.\n\n(11). Aside from its physical advantages, the placebo effect has also proven useful in clinical trials . Especially when a new version of a drug needs to be tested against the old, placebo drugs are provided to the control group to see if the new drug is indeed an improvement over its predecessor . Although it is possible for the placebo drug to cloud these results as well, so it becomes vital to repeat such experiments and compare outcomes multiple times.\n\n(12). Although the placebo effect has been proven to be transitory by countless research projects, people’s wrongful idea of it may lead to issues. They might abandon real drugs that have proven results and opt to stick with the hope that the fake drug will keep working. Regardless, as it has been elucidated by the medical literature, doctors are a key clog in the placebo chain of effects. Their job is to not only provide a caring service, but to ensure that their patients are fully aware of the evanescence of the placebo effect. Optimism in the face of delivering tough news also emerges as an integral aspect of healthcare. Healthcare professionals must be vigilant with their words because what their patients believe, they manifest."

      "concept_text": "Paragraph 12 states: “Optimism in the face of delivering tough news also emerges as an integral aspect of healthcare. Healthcare professional must be vigilant with their words because what their patients believe, they manifest.” Since patients manifest what they believe, the author believes that doctors should be optimistic yet vigilant with their words. This illustrates the placebo phenomenon which the author describes throughout the passage. Hence, the author’s speech will likely center around doctors encouraging patients to have optimistic and realistic beliefs in order to mediate their recovery. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. As technology progresses, the control of digital misinformation gains importance – is incorrect because the author is not concerned about the spread of digital misinformation as this topic does not arise within the text. Rather, the passage focuses on the placebo phenomenon and its effects on healthcare. Option C. The mind is more powerful than medicine, so it should be trained for the greater good – is incorrect because although the author does consider the mind to be powerful because it mediates the placebo effect, the author never explicitly compares the power of the mind to medicine. As such, we cannot conclude that the mind is more powerful than medicine. Option D. Doctors must reflect on their beliefs before imposing limiting labels on patients – is incorrect because the doctor’s belief system is not a topic of discussion within the text. Although the author does believe that “Healthcare professional must be vigilant with their words because what their patients believe, they manifest,” (Paragraph 12), the author never claims that doctors’ own belief systems is what causes them to “plague” their patients with limiting labels. Option E. The “care” element of healthcare needs to be revived – is incorrect because although the end of the passage discusses how doctors can provide better care, the focus of the passage is not about care within the healthcare field. Rather, the focus is about the placebo effect and its implications in healthcare – ranging from being used in clinical trials to advocating for a more holistic approach to healthcare.",
