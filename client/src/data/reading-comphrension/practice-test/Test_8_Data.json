      "text": "(1). Since the time of the earliest civilizations, human beings have used our sense of taste to classify food as nutritious or poisonous. For instance, while bitterness signaled a pernicious substance that was to be avoided, saltiness indicated a source of essential ions . As human intelligence and appetite evolved, so did our taste perception, which formed into a complicated system integrating the smell, texture, and temperature of what we eat into our central nervous system. The final product of this is a pristine experience of satiation that is too often taken for granted. The void of ancient threats in modern times has shaped our gustation into a medium for enjoyment rather than protection. Perhaps a closer investigation into the human sense of taste can help us appreciate it on a deeper level.\n\n(2). Our perception of taste begins with the many taste buds that are located throughout the tongue. There is a common misconception that the visible bumps on the tongue are taste buds, but these protrusions, known as lingual papillae , are actually where the taste buds are stored. Indeed, each papilla stores hundreds of taste buds. There are 4 types of papillae on the tongue, but the 3 equipped with the specific machinery to interpret taste are known as fungiform papillae, foliate papillae, and circumvallate papillae . Fungiform papillae are located towards the front region of the tongue, while foliate papillae line the lateral portion of the tongue, and circumvallate papillae are found towards the posterior region of the tongue. In addition to the misunderstanding regarding location of the taste buds mentioned above, there is another misconception that certain areas of the tongue detect different tastes. This concept is usually found in high school biology textbooks and is based on one of the earliest (but flawed) experiments in gustation. In truth, each taste bud has the capacity to detect all the major taste categories, which are saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, and umami . A second class of supporting stem cells is housed in the posterior region of each taste bud. As taste cells are subject to damage through heat or other stimuli, the aforementioned stem cells regularly replace old gustatory cells so that our sense of taste is kept sharp.\n\n(3). Similar to our sense of smell, our sense of taste is modulated by chemoreceptors . In between the papillae are openings called “ pores ,” which allow for the entry of food chemicals. Once a food molecule passes through one of these pores, it encounters gustation hairs (these are microvilli structures that trap molecules and, much like a broom, sweep them towards the chemoreceptors on the exterior surface of taste buds). Without exception, each taste bud contains an assortment of between 50 and 100 distinct taste -detecting cells. The gustation cells are distinguished by their receptors and axonal destination; however, they all depend on the depolarization of their intracellular matrix to elicit an action potential.\n\n(4). Depolarization is the process by which nerve cells receive and relay information. A typical nervous cell holds a resting potential of -70 mV and a threshold potential of -55 mV. Once the interior of the cell is depolarized by an influx of positive ions beyond the threshold, a signal is fired toward the next nervous nexus . In taste cells, following the binding of a substrate to the chemoreceptors, ionic channels on the membrane, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and endoplasmic reticular calcium, are opened. The action potential is relayed from the axonal connections of the gustation cells to synapse with the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem.\n\n(5). The depolarization process has two variations . In the first, the sweet, umami, and bitter cells have G-protein-coupled receptors that first become bound by a given food chemical (glucose is one example of such a chemical), then, through a secondary messenger pathway membrane, ion channels open to induce depolarization. In the second variation, the salt and sour gustatory cells have ion channels on their membrane that open in direct response to substrate binding, causing an immediate depolarization and firing of an action potential. While the depolarization mechanism of the gustatory cells may vary, the action potential is predictable in the fact that it leads to the release of neurotransmitters that are then carried to the base of the brain via afferent nerves.\n\n(6). Once an action potential threshold is reached in gustatory cells, these cells release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft of afferent neurons located in the base of the brain. Cranial nerves 7, 9, and 10 are responsible for transporting the information from the mouth to the central nervous system, where it is then processed from an electrical potential to a palpable experience. Nerve 7 innervates the front region of the tongue, while nerve 9 innervates the midportion and the 10th nerve detects taste in the epiglottis.\n\n(7). There are several other components of taste worth mentioning. One such component is cranial nerve 5, which is responsible for relaying a number of sensations to the brain. Some of the aforementioned sensations include spiciness , which excites somatosensory fibers on the tongue when encountered with molecules of chili pepper, ginger, or horseradish, and numbness , which may also show up as the consequence of a sharp spice. Another is coolness , which is perceived as a temperature drop without any actual such drop occurring, and it is often accompanied by a minty taste. Two further examples are astringency, or a “ harsh taste” , which is often triggered by unripe foods, such as a banana or persimmon, and a metallic sense, which is perceived primarily because of medicine, blood, or a dental amalgam. Lastly, the sensation of fat is another component that can affect the flavor of food.\n\n(8). Individual sensory nerves originating from the tongue merge in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem. From here, the signal is passed to the thalamus before it is sent to the gustatory cortex in the brain. Akin to an engineer in a busy train station with many rails, the thalamus determines what lever must be pulled to ascertain the course of transmission. After the gustatory cortex receives the signal, its outward axons innervate into the amygdala . Finally, the amygdala makes the ultimate decision as to how the experience will be remembered when it turns the signal into memory.\n\n(9). The memory of food is a compilation of all the moving parts involved in flavor perception . Aside from taste, flavor also includes the integral smell of food. The olfactory system is somewhat more complicated than taste, simply because volatile compounds are much more diverse, hence requiring additional specialized receptors for detection. While we can detect a relatively limited number of ‘ taste perceptions ’, the olfactory system has roughly 400 variations of scent detectors, culminating in the production of about a trillion different odours. Notably, dogs have 300 million olfactory receptors, compared to the human count of 6 million. Ultimately, it is the total combination of aroma, taste, texture, and temperature that produces a flavor that implants itself in our memory.\n\n(10). The act of smelling begins with chemoreceptors embedded in the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. After gaseous molecules are filtered through the nose hairs, they begin to dissolve in the mucus. The odour is then deconstructed into substrates that bind to receptors on the olfactory sensory neurons and initiate the depolarization cascade. Located directly above the olfactory epithelium is the nasal bone, and above the nasal bone is the olfactory bulb, which is a structure that organizes and streamlines electrical communication from the nose to the brain. The action potential from several axons meets in the glomerulus, a congregation of primary sensory olfactory cells within the olfactory bulb. The glomerulus relays its integrated message onto another type of nerve called the “ mitral cell ,” which delivers the signal to higher regions of the brain.\n\n(11). The neurobiological perspective of food tendencies and preferences has profound impacts. As children, we form strong associations with our sensory experiences, especially taste. If a certain food, for instance, brussels sprouts, makes us feel disgusted, the amygdala will always aim to avoid the food at all costs, even if the brussels sprouts are roasted beautifully with just the right blend of spices. In the same vein, when children are exposed to rich, fatty foods at an early age and live in a household that endorses unhealthy eating habits, they will be conditioned to enjoy foods that taste good but are detrimental to their long-term health and wellbeing.\n\n(12). One of the greatest healthcare challenges we face today is discerning between good and bad sugars. It is known that white sugar and its refined forms are the root cause of the most prevalent diseases we face today, such as diabetes type II, cancer, and Alzheimer’s . Furthermore, excessive sugar intake disrupts our healthy metabolic cycle by increasing blood sugar, blood pressure, and fat storage . Consequently, the heart loses its capacity to deliver nutrients to vital organs. Malnourished cells give rise to stress, disease, and eventually uncontrollable health conditions. The simplest step we can take is to notice how white sugar and its refined analogues make us feel when we indulge in them in excess. Ultimately, an increased investment in our internal health elevates our well-being, appreciation, and joy in life."

As this is the case, we can presume that the answer we are seeking will be located in close proximity to the initial mention of papillae in the passage.

Paragraph 2 states: “There are 4 types of papillae on the tongue, but the 3 equipped with the specific machinery to interpret taste are known as fungiform papillae, foliate papillae, and circumvallate papillae.” This tells us that the papillae that store taste buds are fungiform, foliate, and circumvallate, but fusiform papillae are not listed as storing taste buds.

      "text": "(1). Since the time of the earliest civilizations, human beings have used our sense of taste to classify food as nutritious or poisonous. For instance, while bitterness signaled a pernicious substance that was to be avoided, saltiness indicated a source of essential ions . As human intelligence and appetite evolved, so did our taste perception, which formed into a complicated system integrating the smell, texture, and temperature of what we eat into our central nervous system. The final product of this is a pristine experience of satiation that is too often taken for granted. The void of ancient threats in modern times has shaped our gustation into a medium for enjoyment rather than protection. Perhaps a closer investigation into the human sense of taste can help us appreciate it on a deeper level.\n\n(2). Our perception of taste begins with the many taste buds that are located throughout the tongue. There is a common misconception that the visible bumps on the tongue are taste buds, but these protrusions, known as lingual papillae , are actually where the taste buds are stored. Indeed, each papilla stores hundreds of taste buds. There are 4 types of papillae on the tongue, but the 3 equipped with the specific machinery to interpret taste are known as fungiform papillae, foliate papillae, and circumvallate papillae . Fungiform papillae are located towards the front region of the tongue, while foliate papillae line the lateral portion of the tongue, and circumvallate papillae are found towards the posterior region of the tongue. In addition to the misunderstanding regarding location of the taste buds mentioned above, there is another misconception that certain areas of the tongue detect different tastes. This concept is usually found in high school biology textbooks and is based on one of the earliest (but flawed) experiments in gustation. In truth, each taste bud has the capacity to detect all the major taste categories, which are saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, and umami . A second class of supporting stem cells is housed in the posterior region of each taste bud. As taste cells are subject to damage through heat or other stimuli, the aforementioned stem cells regularly replace old gustatory cells so that our sense of taste is kept sharp.\n\n(3). Similar to our sense of smell, our sense of taste is modulated by chemoreceptors . In between the papillae are openings called “ pores ,” which allow for the entry of food chemicals. Once a food molecule passes through one of these pores, it encounters gustation hairs (these are microvilli structures that trap molecules and, much like a broom, sweep them towards the chemoreceptors on the exterior surface of taste buds). Without exception, each taste bud contains an assortment of between 50 and 100 distinct taste -detecting cells. The gustation cells are distinguished by their receptors and axonal destination; however, they all depend on the depolarization of their intracellular matrix to elicit an action potential.\n\n(4). Depolarization is the process by which nerve cells receive and relay information. A typical nervous cell holds a resting potential of -70 mV and a threshold potential of -55 mV. Once the interior of the cell is depolarized by an influx of positive ions beyond the threshold, a signal is fired toward the next nervous nexus . In taste cells, following the binding of a substrate to the chemoreceptors, ionic channels on the membrane, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and endoplasmic reticular calcium, are opened. The action potential is relayed from the axonal connections of the gustation cells to synapse with the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem.\n\n(5). The depolarization process has two variations . In the first, the sweet, umami, and bitter cells have G-protein-coupled receptors that first become bound by a given food chemical (glucose is one example of such a chemical), then, through a secondary messenger pathway membrane, ion channels open to induce depolarization. In the second variation, the salt and sour gustatory cells have ion channels on their membrane that open in direct response to substrate binding, causing an immediate depolarization and firing of an action potential. While the depolarization mechanism of the gustatory cells may vary, the action potential is predictable in the fact that it leads to the release of neurotransmitters that are then carried to the base of the brain via afferent nerves.\n\n(6). Once an action potential threshold is reached in gustatory cells, these cells release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft of afferent neurons located in the base of the brain. Cranial nerves 7, 9, and 10 are responsible for transporting the information from the mouth to the central nervous system, where it is then processed from an electrical potential to a palpable experience. Nerve 7 innervates the front region of the tongue, while nerve 9 innervates the midportion and the 10th nerve detects taste in the epiglottis.\n\n(7). There are several other components of taste worth mentioning. One such component is cranial nerve 5, which is responsible for relaying a number of sensations to the brain. Some of the aforementioned sensations include spiciness , which excites somatosensory fibers on the tongue when encountered with molecules of chili pepper, ginger, or horseradish, and numbness , which may also show up as the consequence of a sharp spice. Another is coolness , which is perceived as a temperature drop without any actual such drop occurring, and it is often accompanied by a minty taste. Two further examples are astringency, or a “ harsh taste” , which is often triggered by unripe foods, such as a banana or persimmon, and a metallic sense, which is perceived primarily because of medicine, blood, or a dental amalgam. Lastly, the sensation of fat is another component that can affect the flavor of food.\n\n(8). Individual sensory nerves originating from the tongue merge in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem. From here, the signal is passed to the thalamus before it is sent to the gustatory cortex in the brain. Akin to an engineer in a busy train station with many rails, the thalamus determines what lever must be pulled to ascertain the course of transmission. After the gustatory cortex receives the signal, its outward axons innervate into the amygdala . Finally, the amygdala makes the ultimate decision as to how the experience will be remembered when it turns the signal into memory.\n\n(9). The memory of food is a compilation of all the moving parts involved in flavor perception . Aside from taste, flavor also includes the integral smell of food. The olfactory system is somewhat more complicated than taste, simply because volatile compounds are much more diverse, hence requiring additional specialized receptors for detection. While we can detect a relatively limited number of ‘ taste perceptions ’, the olfactory system has roughly 400 variations of scent detectors, culminating in the production of about a trillion different odours. Notably, dogs have 300 million olfactory receptors, compared to the human count of 6 million. Ultimately, it is the total combination of aroma, taste, texture, and temperature that produces a flavor that implants itself in our memory.\n\n(10). The act of smelling begins with chemoreceptors embedded in the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. After gaseous molecules are filtered through the nose hairs, they begin to dissolve in the mucus. The odour is then deconstructed into substrates that bind to receptors on the olfactory sensory neurons and initiate the depolarization cascade. Located directly above the olfactory epithelium is the nasal bone, and above the nasal bone is the olfactory bulb, which is a structure that organizes and streamlines electrical communication from the nose to the brain. The action potential from several axons meets in the glomerulus, a congregation of primary sensory olfactory cells within the olfactory bulb. The glomerulus relays its integrated message onto another type of nerve called the “ mitral cell ,” which delivers the signal to higher regions of the brain.\n\n(11). The neurobiological perspective of food tendencies and preferences has profound impacts. As children, we form strong associations with our sensory experiences, especially taste. If a certain food, for instance, brussels sprouts, makes us feel disgusted, the amygdala will always aim to avoid the food at all costs, even if the brussels sprouts are roasted beautifully with just the right blend of spices. In the same vein, when children are exposed to rich, fatty foods at an early age and live in a household that endorses unhealthy eating habits, they will be conditioned to enjoy foods that taste good but are detrimental to their long-term health and wellbeing.\n\n(12). One of the greatest healthcare challenges we face today is discerning between good and bad sugars. It is known that white sugar and its refined forms are the root cause of the most prevalent diseases we face today, such as diabetes type II, cancer, and Alzheimer’s . Furthermore, excessive sugar intake disrupts our healthy metabolic cycle by increasing blood sugar, blood pressure, and fat storage . Consequently, the heart loses its capacity to deliver nutrients to vital organs. Malnourished cells give rise to stress, disease, and eventually uncontrollable health conditions. The simplest step we can take is to notice how white sugar and its refined analogues make us feel when we indulge in them in excess. Ultimately, an increased investment in our internal health elevates our well-being, appreciation, and joy in life."

As taste cells are subject to damage through heat or other stimuli, the aforementioned stem cells regularly replace old gustatory cells so that our sense of taste is kept sharp.\n\n(3). Similar to our sense of smell, our sense of taste is modulated by chemoreceptors . In between the papillae are openings called “ pores ,” which allow for the entry of food chemicals. Once a food molecule passes through one of these pores, it encounters gustation hairs (these are microvilli structures that trap molecules and, much like a broom, sweep them towards the chemoreceptors on the exterior surface of taste buds). Without exception, each taste bud contains an assortment of between 50 and 100 distinct taste -detecting cells. The gustation cells are distinguished by their receptors and axonal destination; however, they all depend on the depolarization of their intracellular matrix to elicit an action potential.\n\n(4). Depolarization is the process by which nerve cells receive and relay information. A typical nervous cell holds a resting potential of -70 mV and a threshold potential of -55 mV. Once the interior of the cell is depolarized by an influx of positive ions beyond the threshold, a signal is fired toward the next nervous nexus . In taste cells, following the binding of a substrate to the chemoreceptors, ionic channels on the membrane, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and endoplasmic reticular calcium, are opened. The action potential is relayed from the axonal connections of the gustation cells to synapse with the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem.\n\n(5). The depolarization process has two variations . In the first, the sweet, umami, and bitter cells have G-protein-coupled receptors that first become bound by a given food chemical (glucose is one example of such a chemical), then, through a secondary messenger pathway membrane, ion channels open to induce depolarization. In the second variation, the salt and sour gustatory cells have ion channels on their membrane that open in direct response to substrate binding, causing an immediate depolarization and firing of an action potential. While the depolarization mechanism of the gustatory cells may vary, the action potential is predictable in the fact that it leads to the release of neurotransmitters that are then carried to the base of the brain via afferent nerves.\n\n(6). Once an action potential threshold is reached in gustatory cells, these cells release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft of afferent neurons located in the base of the brain. Cranial nerves 7, 9, and 10 are responsible for transporting the information from the mouth to the central nervous system, where it is then processed from an electrical potential to a palpable experience. Nerve 7 innervates the front region of the tongue, while nerve 9 innervates the midportion and the 10th nerve detects taste in the epiglottis.\n\n(7). There are several other components of taste worth mentioning. One such component is cranial nerve 5, which is responsible for relaying a number of sensations to the brain. Some of the aforementioned sensations include spiciness , which excites somatosensory fibers on the tongue when encountered with molecules of chili pepper, ginger, or horseradish, and numbness , which may also show up as the consequence of a sharp spice. Another is coolness , which is perceived as a temperature drop without any actual such drop occurring, and it is often accompanied by a minty taste. Two further examples are astringency, or a “ harsh taste” , which is often triggered by unripe foods, such as a banana or persimmon, and a metallic sense, which is perceived primarily because of medicine, blood, or a dental amalgam. Lastly, the sensation of fat is another component that can affect the flavor of food.\n\n(8). Individual sensory nerves originating from the tongue merge in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem. From here, the signal is passed to the thalamus before it is sent to the gustatory cortex in the brain. Akin to an engineer in a busy train station with many rails, the thalamus determines what lever must be pulled to ascertain the course of transmission. After the gustatory cortex receives the signal, its outward axons innervate into the amygdala . Finally, the amygdala makes the ultimate decision as to how the experience will be remembered when it turns the signal into memory.\n\n(9). The memory of food is a compilation of all the moving parts involved in flavor perception . Aside from taste, flavor also includes the integral smell of food. The olfactory system is somewhat more complicated than taste, simply because volatile compounds are much more diverse, hence requiring additional specialized receptors for detection. While we can detect a relatively limited number of ‘ taste perceptions ’, the olfactory system has roughly 400 variations of scent detectors, culminating in the production of about a trillion different odours. Notably, dogs have 300 million olfactory receptors, compared to the human count of 6 million. Ultimately, it is the total combination of aroma, taste, texture, and temperature that produces a flavor that implants itself in our memory.\n\n(10). The act of smelling begins with chemoreceptors embedded in the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. After gaseous molecules are filtered through the nose hairs, they begin to dissolve in the mucus. The odour is then deconstructed into substrates that bind to receptors on the olfactory sensory neurons and initiate the depolarization cascade. Located directly above the olfactory epithelium is the nasal bone, and above the nasal bone is the olfactory bulb, which is a structure that organizes and streamlines electrical communication from the nose to the brain. The action potential from several axons meets in the glomerulus, a congregation of primary sensory olfactory cells within the olfactory bulb. The glomerulus relays its integrated message onto another type of nerve called the “ mitral cell ,” which delivers the signal to higher regions of the brain.\n\n(11). The neurobiological perspective of food tendencies and preferences has profound impacts. As children, we form strong associations with our sensory experiences, especially taste. If a certain food, for instance, brussels sprouts, makes us feel disgusted, the amygdala will always aim to avoid the food at all costs, even if the brussels sprouts are roasted beautifully with just the right blend of spices. In the same vein, when children are exposed to rich, fatty foods at an early age and live in a household that endorses unhealthy eating habits, they will be conditioned to enjoy foods that taste good but are detrimental to their long-term health and wellbeing.\n\n(12). One of the greatest healthcare challenges we face today is discerning between good and bad sugars. It is known that white sugar and its refined forms are the root cause of the most prevalent diseases we face today, such as diabetes type II, cancer, and Alzheimer’s . Furthermore, excessive sugar intake disrupts our healthy metabolic cycle by increasing blood sugar, blood pressure, and fat storage . Consequently, the heart loses its capacity to deliver nutrients to vital organs. Malnourished cells give rise to stress, disease, and eventually uncontrollable health conditions. The simplest step we can take is to notice how white sugar and its refined analogues make us feel when we indulge in them in excess. Ultimately, an increased investment in our internal health elevates our well-being, appreciation, and joy in life."

      "text": "(1). Since the time of the earliest civilizations, human beings have used our sense of taste to classify food as nutritious or poisonous. For instance, while bitterness signaled a pernicious substance that was to be avoided, saltiness indicated a source of essential ions . As human intelligence and appetite evolved, so did our taste perception, which formed into a complicated system integrating the smell, texture, and temperature of what we eat into our central nervous system. The final product of this is a pristine experience of satiation that is too often taken for granted. The void of ancient threats in modern times has shaped our gustation into a medium for enjoyment rather than protection. Perhaps a closer investigation into the human sense of taste can help us appreciate it on a deeper level.\n\n(2). Our perception of taste begins with the many taste buds that are located throughout the tongue. There is a common misconception that the visible bumps on the tongue are taste buds, but these protrusions, known as lingual papillae , are actually where the taste buds are stored. Indeed, each papilla stores hundreds of taste buds. There are 4 types of papillae on the tongue, but the 3 equipped with the specific machinery to interpret taste are known as fungiform papillae, foliate papillae, and circumvallate papillae . Fungiform papillae are located towards the front region of the tongue, while foliate papillae line the lateral portion of the tongue, and circumvallate papillae are found towards the posterior region of the tongue. In addition to the misunderstanding regarding location of the taste buds mentioned above, there is another misconception that certain areas of the tongue detect different tastes. This concept is usually found in high school biology textbooks and is based on one of the earliest (but flawed) experiments in gustation. In truth, each taste bud has the capacity to detect all the major taste categories, which are saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, and umami .

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, recall that paragraph 11 discussed how children can become addicted to unhealthy foods if the environment they grew up in encourages such a diet. Thus, we can deduce that a discussion of the effects of junk foods will follow in the succeeding paragraph. Indeed, the 12th paragraph provides information regarding the overconsumption of sugar. Paragraph 12 states: “Furthermore, excessive sugar intake disrupts our healthy metabolic cycle by increasing blood sugar, blood pressure, and fat storage .” This tells us that elevated fats are a side effect of overconsuming sugar. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A . A disabled metabolism – is incorrect because paragraph 12 states that excessive sugar intake disrupts metabolism, but does not specify that it disables it. Option B . Low blood sugar – is incorrect because paragraph 12 states that excessive sugar intake INCREASES blood sugar. Option C. Strokes – is incorrect because the text does not specify strokes as an outcome of excessive sugar consumption.",

      "text": "(1). Since the time of the earliest civilizations, human beings have used our sense of taste to classify food as nutritious or poisonous. For instance, while bitterness signaled a pernicious substance that was to be avoided, saltiness indicated a source of essential ions . As human intelligence and appetite evolved, so did our taste perception, which formed into a complicated system integrating the smell, texture, and temperature of what we eat into our central nervous system. The final product of this is a pristine experience of satiation that is too often taken for granted. The void of ancient threats in modern times has shaped our gustation into a medium for enjoyment rather than protection. Perhaps a closer investigation into the human sense of taste can help us appreciate it on a deeper level.\n\n(2). Our perception of taste begins with the many taste buds that are located throughout the tongue. There is a common misconception that the visible bumps on the tongue are taste buds, but these protrusions, known as lingual papillae , are actually where the taste buds are stored. Indeed, each papilla stores hundreds of taste buds. There are 4 types of papillae on the tongue, but the 3 equipped with the specific machinery to interpret taste are known as fungiform papillae, foliate papillae, and circumvallate papillae . Fungiform papillae are located towards the front region of the tongue, while foliate papillae line the lateral portion of the tongue, and circumvallate papillae are found towards the posterior region of the tongue. In addition to the misunderstanding regarding location of the taste buds mentioned above, there is another misconception that certain areas of the tongue detect different tastes. This concept is usually found in high school biology textbooks and is based on one of the earliest (but flawed) experiments in gustation. In truth, each taste bud has the capacity to detect all the major taste categories, which are saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, and umami . A second class of supporting stem cells is housed in the posterior region of each taste bud. As taste cells are subject to damage through heat or other stimuli, the aforementioned stem cells regularly replace old gustatory cells so that our sense of taste is kept sharp.\n\n(3). Similar to our sense of smell, our sense of taste is modulated by chemoreceptors . In between the papillae are openings called “ pores ,” which allow for the entry of food chemicals. Once a food molecule passes through one of these pores, it encounters gustation hairs (these are microvilli structures that trap molecules and, much like a broom, sweep them towards the chemoreceptors on the exterior surface of taste buds). Without exception, each taste bud contains an assortment of between 50 and 100 distinct taste -detecting cells. The gustation cells are distinguished by their receptors and axonal destination; however, they all depend on the depolarization of their intracellular matrix to elicit an action potential.\n\n(4). Depolarization is the process by which nerve cells receive and relay information. A typical nervous cell holds a resting potential of -70 mV and a threshold potential of -55 mV. Once the interior of the cell is depolarized by an influx of positive ions beyond the threshold, a signal is fired toward the next nervous nexus . In taste cells, following the binding of a substrate to the chemoreceptors, ionic channels on the membrane, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and endoplasmic reticular calcium, are opened. The action potential is relayed from the axonal connections of the gustation cells to synapse with the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem.\n\n(5). The depolarization process has two variations . In the first, the sweet, umami, and bitter cells have G-protein-coupled receptors that first become bound by a given food chemical (glucose is one example of such a chemical), then, through a secondary messenger pathway membrane, ion channels open to induce depolarization. In the second variation, the salt and sour gustatory cells have ion channels on their membrane that open in direct response to substrate binding, causing an immediate depolarization and firing of an action potential. While the depolarization mechanism of the gustatory cells may vary, the action potential is predictable in the fact that it leads to the release of neurotransmitters that are then carried to the base of the brain via afferent nerves.\n\n(6). Once an action potential threshold is reached in gustatory cells, these cells release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft of afferent neurons located in the base of the brain. Cranial nerves 7, 9, and 10 are responsible for transporting the information from the mouth to the central nervous system, where it is then processed from an electrical potential to a palpable experience. Nerve 7 innervates the front region of the tongue, while nerve 9 innervates the midportion and the 10th nerve detects taste in the epiglottis.\n\n(7). There are several other components of taste worth mentioning. One such component is cranial nerve 5, which is responsible for relaying a number of sensations to the brain. Some of the aforementioned sensations include spiciness , which excites somatosensory fibers on the tongue when encountered with molecules of chili pepper, ginger, or horseradish, and numbness , which may also show up as the consequence of a sharp spice. Another is coolness , which is perceived as a temperature drop without any actual such drop occurring, and it is often accompanied by a minty taste. Two further examples are astringency, or a “ harsh taste” , which is often triggered by unripe foods, such as a banana or persimmon, and a metallic sense, which is perceived primarily because of medicine, blood, or a dental amalgam. Lastly, the sensation of fat is another component that can affect the flavor of food.\n\n(8). Individual sensory nerves originating from the tongue merge in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem. From here, the signal is passed to the thalamus before it is sent to the gustatory cortex in the brain. Akin to an engineer in a busy train station with many rails, the thalamus determines what lever must be pulled to ascertain the course of transmission. After the gustatory cortex receives the signal, its outward axons innervate into the amygdala . Finally, the amygdala makes the ultimate decision as to how the experience will be remembered when it turns the signal into memory.\n\n(9). The memory of food is a compilation of all the moving parts involved in flavor perception . Aside from taste, flavor also includes the integral smell of food. The olfactory system is somewhat more complicated than taste, simply because volatile compounds are much more diverse, hence requiring additional specialized receptors for detection. While we can detect a relatively limited number of ‘ taste perceptions ’, the olfactory system has roughly 400 variations of scent detectors, culminating in the production of about a trillion different odours. Notably, dogs have 300 million olfactory receptors, compared to the human count of 6 million. Ultimately, it is the total combination of aroma, taste, texture, and temperature that produces a flavor that implants itself in our memory.\n\n(10). The act of smelling begins with chemoreceptors embedded in the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. After gaseous molecules are filtered through the nose hairs, they begin to dissolve in the mucus. The odour is then deconstructed into substrates that bind to receptors on the olfactory sensory neurons and initiate the depolarization cascade. Located directly above the olfactory epithelium is the nasal bone, and above the nasal bone is the olfactory bulb, which is a structure that organizes and streamlines electrical communication from the nose to the brain. The action potential from several axons meets in the glomerulus, a congregation of primary sensory olfactory cells within the olfactory bulb. The glomerulus relays its integrated message onto another type of nerve called the “ mitral cell ,” which delivers the signal to higher regions of the brain.\n\n(11). The neurobiological perspective of food tendencies and preferences has profound impacts. As children, we form strong associations with our sensory experiences, especially taste. If a certain food, for instance, brussels sprouts, makes us feel disgusted, the amygdala will always aim to avoid the food at all costs, even if the brussels sprouts are roasted beautifully with just the right blend of spices. In the same vein, when children are exposed to rich, fatty foods at an early age and live in a household that endorses unhealthy eating habits, they will be conditioned to enjoy foods that taste good but are detrimental to their long-term health and wellbeing.\n\n(12). One of the greatest healthcare challenges we face today is discerning between good and bad sugars. It is known that white sugar and its refined forms are the root cause of the most prevalent diseases we face today, such as diabetes type II, cancer, and Alzheimer’s . Furthermore, excessive sugar intake disrupts our healthy metabolic cycle by increasing blood sugar, blood pressure, and fat storage . Consequently, the heart loses its capacity to deliver nutrients to vital organs. Malnourished cells give rise to stress, disease, and eventually uncontrollable health conditions. The simplest step we can take is to notice how white sugar and its refined analogues make us feel when we indulge in them in excess. Ultimately, an increased investment in our internal health elevates our well-being, appreciation, and joy in life."

Nerve 7 innervates the front region of the tongue, while nerve 9 innervates the midportion and the 10th nerve detects taste in the epiglottis.\n\n(7). There are several other components of taste worth mentioning. One such component is cranial nerve 5, which is responsible for relaying a number of sensations to the brain. Some of the aforementioned sensations include spiciness , which excites somatosensory fibers on the tongue when encountered with molecules of chili pepper, ginger, or horseradish, and numbness , which may also show up as the consequence of a sharp spice. Another is coolness , which is perceived as a temperature drop without any actual such drop occurring, and it is often accompanied by a minty taste. Two further examples are astringency, or a “ harsh taste” , which is often triggered by unripe foods, such as a banana or persimmon, and a metallic sense, which is perceived primarily because of medicine, blood, or a dental amalgam. Lastly, the sensation of fat is another component that can affect the flavor of food.\n\n(8). Individual sensory nerves originating from the tongue merge in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem. From here, the signal is passed to the thalamus before it is sent to the gustatory cortex in the brain. Akin to an engineer in a busy train station with many rails, the thalamus determines what lever must be pulled to ascertain the course of transmission. After the gustatory cortex receives the signal, its outward axons innervate into the amygdala . Finally, the amygdala makes the ultimate decision as to how the experience will be remembered when it turns the signal into memory.\n\n(9). The memory of food is a compilation of all the moving parts involved in flavor perception . Aside from taste, flavor also includes the integral smell of food. The olfactory system is somewhat more complicated than taste, simply because volatile compounds are much more diverse, hence requiring additional specialized receptors for detection. While we can detect a relatively limited number of ‘ taste perceptions ’, the olfactory system has roughly 400 variations of scent detectors, culminating in the production of about a trillion different odours. Notably, dogs have 300 million olfactory receptors, compared to the human count of 6 million. Ultimately, it is the total combination of aroma, taste, texture, and temperature that produces a flavor that implants itself in our memory.\n\n(10). The act of smelling begins with chemoreceptors embedded in the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. After gaseous molecules are filtered through the nose hairs, they begin to dissolve in the mucus. The odour is then deconstructed into substrates that bind to receptors on the olfactory sensory neurons and initiate the depolarization cascade. Located directly above the olfactory epithelium is the nasal bone, and above the nasal bone is the olfactory bulb, which is a structure that organizes and streamlines electrical communication from the nose to the brain. The action potential from several axons meets in the glomerulus, a congregation of primary sensory olfactory cells within the olfactory bulb. The glomerulus relays its integrated message onto another type of nerve called the “ mitral cell ,” which delivers the signal to higher regions of the brain.\n\n(11). The neurobiological perspective of food tendencies and preferences has profound impacts. As children, we form strong associations with our sensory experiences, especially taste. If a certain food, for instance, brussels sprouts, makes us feel disgusted, the amygdala will always aim to avoid the food at all costs, even if the brussels sprouts are roasted beautifully with just the right blend of spices. In the same vein, when children are exposed to rich, fatty foods at an early age and live in a household that endorses unhealthy eating habits, they will be conditioned to enjoy foods that taste good but are detrimental to their long-term health and wellbeing.\n\n(12). One of the greatest healthcare challenges we face today is discerning between good and bad sugars. It is known that white sugar and its refined forms are the root cause of the most prevalent diseases we face today, such as diabetes type II, cancer, and Alzheimer’s . Furthermore, excessive sugar intake disrupts our healthy metabolic cycle by increasing blood sugar, blood pressure, and fat storage . Consequently, the heart loses its capacity to deliver nutrients to vital organs. Malnourished cells give rise to stress, disease, and eventually uncontrollable health conditions. The simplest step we can take is to notice how white sugar and its refined analogues make us feel when we indulge in them in excess. Ultimately, an increased investment in our internal health elevates our well-being, appreciation, and joy in life."

If we recall that this topic is discussed in the 11 th paragraph, we can scan this portion of the text for the relevant information we are seeking. Paragraph 11 states: “The neurobiological perspective of food tendencies and preferences has profound impacts. As children, we form strong associations with our sensory experiences, especially taste. If a certain food, for instance, Brussels sprouts, makes us feel disgusted, the amygdala will always aim to avoid the food at all costs, even if the Brussels sprouts are roasted beautifully with just the right blend of spices.” This tells us that when an individual’s amygdala is conditioned to dislike certain foods in childhood, it will continually aim to avoid these foods in the future, even if said foods are prepared to a high quality. Therefore, Option E is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A . The individual will be prone to developing Alzheimer's disease and Type II Diabetes – is incorrect because, while the passage states in paragraph 12 that an excess of refined sugars can lead to these diseases, it does not state that a lack of green vegetables necessarily leads to these conditions. Option B . The individual will be conditioned to enjoy unhealthy foods that taste enjoyable - is incorrect because, while paragraph 11 states that children raised in households where unhealthy food is consumed may be conditioned to enjoy these foods, it does not state that children conditioned to dislike green vegetables will necessarily enjoy unhealthy foods as a result. Option C. There will be no discernible impact upon the individual in adulthood – is incorrect because paragraph 11 states that those who are conditioned to dislike certain foods in childhood will continue to avoid those foods in the future, which means that there is an impact. Option D. The individual will likely encounter nutritional deficiencies throughout their life – is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about nutritional deficiencies stemming from a conditioned dislike of green vegetables.",

      "text": "(1). Since the time of the earliest civilizations, human beings have used our sense of taste to classify food as nutritious or poisonous. For instance, while bitterness signaled a pernicious substance that was to be avoided, saltiness indicated a source of essential ions . As human intelligence and appetite evolved, so did our taste perception, which formed into a complicated system integrating the smell, texture, and temperature of what we eat into our central nervous system. The final product of this is a pristine experience of satiation that is too often taken for granted. The void of ancient threats in modern times has shaped our gustation into a medium for enjoyment rather than protection. Perhaps a closer investigation into the human sense of taste can help us appreciate it on a deeper level.\n\n(2). Our perception of taste begins with the many taste buds that are located throughout the tongue. There is a common misconception that the visible bumps on the tongue are taste buds, but these protrusions, known as lingual papillae , are actually where the taste buds are stored. Indeed, each papilla stores hundreds of taste buds. There are 4 types of papillae on the tongue, but the 3 equipped with the specific machinery to interpret taste are known as fungiform papillae, foliate papillae, and circumvallate papillae . Fungiform papillae are located towards the front region of the tongue, while foliate papillae line the lateral portion of the tongue, and circumvallate papillae are found towards the posterior region of the tongue. In addition to the misunderstanding regarding location of the taste buds mentioned above, there is another misconception that certain areas of the tongue detect different tastes. This concept is usually found in high school biology textbooks and is based on one of the earliest (but flawed) experiments in gustation. In truth, each taste bud has the capacity to detect all the major taste categories, which are saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, and umami . A second class of supporting stem cells is housed in the posterior region of each taste bud. As taste cells are subject to damage through heat or other stimuli, the aforementioned stem cells regularly replace old gustatory cells so that our sense of taste is kept sharp.\n\n(3). Similar to our sense of smell, our sense of taste is modulated by chemoreceptors . In between the papillae are openings called “ pores ,” which allow for the entry of food chemicals. Once a food molecule passes through one of these pores, it encounters gustation hairs (these are microvilli structures that trap molecules and, much like a broom, sweep them towards the chemoreceptors on the exterior surface of taste buds). Without exception, each taste bud contains an assortment of between 50 and 100 distinct taste -detecting cells. The gustation cells are distinguished by their receptors and axonal destination; however, they all depend on the depolarization of their intracellular matrix to elicit an action potential.\n\n(4). Depolarization is the process by which nerve cells receive and relay information. A typical nervous cell holds a resting potential of -70 mV and a threshold potential of -55 mV. Once the interior of the cell is depolarized by an influx of positive ions beyond the threshold, a signal is fired toward the next nervous nexus . In taste cells, following the binding of a substrate to the chemoreceptors, ionic channels on the membrane, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and endoplasmic reticular calcium, are opened. The action potential is relayed from the axonal connections of the gustation cells to synapse with the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem.\n\n(5). The depolarization process has two variations . In the first, the sweet, umami, and bitter cells have G-protein-coupled receptors that first become bound by a given food chemical (glucose is one example of such a chemical), then, through a secondary messenger pathway membrane, ion channels open to induce depolarization. In the second variation, the salt and sour gustatory cells have ion channels on their membrane that open in direct response to substrate binding, causing an immediate depolarization and firing of an action potential. While the depolarization mechanism of the gustatory cells may vary, the action potential is predictable in the fact that it leads to the release of neurotransmitters that are then carried to the base of the brain via afferent nerves.\n\n(6). Once an action potential threshold is reached in gustatory cells, these cells release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft of afferent neurons located in the base of the brain. Cranial nerves 7, 9, and 10 are responsible for transporting the information from the mouth to the central nervous system, where it is then processed from an electrical potential to a palpable experience.

Another is coolness , which is perceived as a temperature drop without any actual such drop occurring, and it is often accompanied by a minty taste. Two further examples are astringency, or a “ harsh taste” , which is often triggered by unripe foods, such as a banana or persimmon, and a metallic sense, which is perceived primarily because of medicine, blood, or a dental amalgam. Lastly, the sensation of fat is another component that can affect the flavor of food.\n\n(8). Individual sensory nerves originating from the tongue merge in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem. From here, the signal is passed to the thalamus before it is sent to the gustatory cortex in the brain.

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should first consider that three of the four option choices in the stem relate to the topic of unhealthy and healthy foods. As this is the case, we should determine wherein the author of the text delves into this topic. If we scan the text, we can see that the aforementioned topic is covered in the 11 th and 12 th paragraphs. Paragraph 12 states: “One of the greatest healthcare challenges we face today is discerning between good and bad sugars. It is known that white sugar and its refined forms are the root cause of the most prevalent diseases we face today, such as diabetes type II, cancer, and Alzheimer’s.” If we now apply critical thinking, we can see that the author believes bad sugars cause serious diseases. We can therefore infer that the author also believes that community–wide educational programs for sugar intake optimization should be implemented to help eliminate or reduce the prevalence of these diseases. The author does not mention making amendments to school lunches, teaching sensory awareness, or using rehabilitation programs for those with green vegetable phobias. If we briefly scan the passage a final time, we can see that EEGs are not mentioned, meaning we cannot know if the author would support the final option choice. Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Carbohydrates ought to be eliminated from elementary school lunches – is incorrect because the author does not single out school lunches as being problematic in the text, NOR do they suggest elementary schools as targets for sugar reduction. Option B. Sensory awareness should be taught to heighten food sensitivity in young children – is incorrect because the author offers no opinion regarding how food sensitivity should be handled in young children. Option C. Individuals with green vegetable phobias require rehabilitation to be desensitized – is incorrect because the author does not mention cures for food phobias in the passage at any point. Option E. Electroencephalograms track the journey of taste from vision to gestation – is incorrect because the author does not mention EEGs in the passage.",

      "title": "Passage 1",
      "text": "(1). Since the time of the earliest civilizations, human beings have used our sense of taste to classify food as nutritious or poisonous. For instance, while bitterness signaled a pernicious substance that was to be avoided, saltiness indicated a source of essential ions . As human intelligence and appetite evolved, so did our taste perception, which formed into a complicated system integrating the smell, texture, and temperature of what we eat into our central nervous system. The final product of this is a pristine experience of satiation that is too often taken for granted. The void of ancient threats in modern times has shaped our gustation into a medium for enjoyment rather than protection. Perhaps a closer investigation into the human sense of taste can help us appreciate it on a deeper level.\n\n(2). Our perception of taste begins with the many taste buds that are located throughout the tongue. There is a common misconception that the visible bumps on the tongue are taste buds, but these protrusions, known as lingual papillae , are actually where the taste buds are stored. Indeed, each papilla stores hundreds of taste buds. There are 4 types of papillae on the tongue, but the 3 equipped with the specific machinery to interpret taste are known as fungiform papillae, foliate papillae, and circumvallate papillae . Fungiform papillae are located towards the front region of the tongue, while foliate papillae line the lateral portion of the tongue, and circumvallate papillae are found towards the posterior region of the tongue. In addition to the misunderstanding regarding location of the taste buds mentioned above, there is another misconception that certain areas of the tongue detect different tastes. This concept is usually found in high school biology textbooks and is based on one of the earliest (but flawed) experiments in gustation. In truth, each taste bud has the capacity to detect all the major taste categories, which are saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, and umami . A second class of supporting stem cells is housed in the posterior region of each taste bud. As taste cells are subject to damage through heat or other stimuli, the aforementioned stem cells regularly replace old gustatory cells so that our sense of taste is kept sharp.\n\n(3). Similar to our sense of smell, our sense of taste is modulated by chemoreceptors . In between the papillae are openings called “ pores ,” which allow for the entry of food chemicals. Once a food molecule passes through one of these pores, it encounters gustation hairs (these are microvilli structures that trap molecules and, much like a broom, sweep them towards the chemoreceptors on the exterior surface of taste buds). Without exception, each taste bud contains an assortment of between 50 and 100 distinct taste -detecting cells. The gustation cells are distinguished by their receptors and axonal destination; however, they all depend on the depolarization of their intracellular matrix to elicit an action potential.\n\n(4). Depolarization is the process by which nerve cells receive and relay information. A typical nervous cell holds a resting potential of -70 mV and a threshold potential of -55 mV. Once the interior of the cell is depolarized by an influx of positive ions beyond the threshold, a signal is fired toward the next nervous nexus . In taste cells, following the binding of a substrate to the chemoreceptors, ionic channels on the membrane, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and endoplasmic reticular calcium, are opened. The action potential is relayed from the axonal connections of the gustation cells to synapse with the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem.\n\n(5). The depolarization process has two variations . In the first, the sweet, umami, and bitter cells have G-protein-coupled receptors that first become bound by a given food chemical (glucose is one example of such a chemical), then, through a secondary messenger pathway membrane, ion channels open to induce depolarization. In the second variation, the salt and sour gustatory cells have ion channels on their membrane that open in direct response to substrate binding, causing an immediate depolarization and firing of an action potential. While the depolarization mechanism of the gustatory cells may vary, the action potential is predictable in the fact that it leads to the release of neurotransmitters that are then carried to the base of the brain via afferent nerves.\n\n(6). Once an action potential threshold is reached in gustatory cells, these cells release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft of afferent neurons located in the base of the brain. Cranial nerves 7, 9, and 10 are responsible for transporting the information from the mouth to the central nervous system, where it is then processed from an electrical potential to a palpable experience. Nerve 7 innervates the front region of the tongue, while nerve 9 innervates the midportion and the 10th nerve detects taste in the epiglottis.\n\n(7). There are several other components of taste worth mentioning. One such component is cranial nerve 5, which is responsible for relaying a number of sensations to the brain. Some of the aforementioned sensations include spiciness , which excites somatosensory fibers on the tongue when encountered with molecules of chili pepper, ginger, or horseradish, and numbness , which may also show up as the consequence of a sharp spice. Another is coolness , which is perceived as a temperature drop without any actual such drop occurring, and it is often accompanied by a minty taste. Two further examples are astringency, or a “ harsh taste” , which is often triggered by unripe foods, such as a banana or persimmon, and a metallic sense, which is perceived primarily because of medicine, blood, or a dental amalgam. Lastly, the sensation of fat is another component that can affect the flavor of food.\n\n(8). Individual sensory nerves originating from the tongue merge in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem. From here, the signal is passed to the thalamus before it is sent to the gustatory cortex in the brain. Akin to an engineer in a busy train station with many rails, the thalamus determines what lever must be pulled to ascertain the course of transmission. After the gustatory cortex receives the signal, its outward axons innervate into the amygdala . Finally, the amygdala makes the ultimate decision as to how the experience will be remembered when it turns the signal into memory.\n\n(9). The memory of food is a compilation of all the moving parts involved in flavor perception . Aside from taste, flavor also includes the integral smell of food. The olfactory system is somewhat more complicated than taste, simply because volatile compounds are much more diverse, hence requiring additional specialized receptors for detection. While we can detect a relatively limited number of ‘ taste perceptions ’, the olfactory system has roughly 400 variations of scent detectors, culminating in the production of about a trillion different odours. Notably, dogs have 300 million olfactory receptors, compared to the human count of 6 million. Ultimately, it is the total combination of aroma, taste, texture, and temperature that produces a flavor that implants itself in our memory.\n\n(10). The act of smelling begins with chemoreceptors embedded in the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. After gaseous molecules are filtered through the nose hairs, they begin to dissolve in the mucus. The odour is then deconstructed into substrates that bind to receptors on the olfactory sensory neurons and initiate the depolarization cascade. Located directly above the olfactory epithelium is the nasal bone, and above the nasal bone is the olfactory bulb, which is a structure that organizes and streamlines electrical communication from the nose to the brain. The action potential from several axons meets in the glomerulus, a congregation of primary sensory olfactory cells within the olfactory bulb. The glomerulus relays its integrated message onto another type of nerve called the “ mitral cell ,” which delivers the signal to higher regions of the brain.\n\n(11). The neurobiological perspective of food tendencies and preferences has profound impacts. As children, we form strong associations with our sensory experiences, especially taste. If a certain food, for instance, brussels sprouts, makes us feel disgusted, the amygdala will always aim to avoid the food at all costs, even if the brussels sprouts are roasted beautifully with just the right blend of spices. In the same vein, when children are exposed to rich, fatty foods at an early age and live in a household that endorses unhealthy eating habits, they will be conditioned to enjoy foods that taste good but are detrimental to their long-term health and wellbeing.\n\n(12). One of the greatest healthcare challenges we face today is discerning between good and bad sugars. It is known that white sugar and its refined forms are the root cause of the most prevalent diseases we face today, such as diabetes type II, cancer, and Alzheimer’s . Furthermore, excessive sugar intake disrupts our healthy metabolic cycle by increasing blood sugar, blood pressure, and fat storage . Consequently, the heart loses its capacity to deliver nutrients to vital organs. Malnourished cells give rise to stress, disease, and eventually uncontrollable health conditions. The simplest step we can take is to notice how white sugar and its refined analogues make us feel when we indulge in them in excess. Ultimately, an increased investment in our internal health elevates our well-being, appreciation, and joy in life."

    "explanation": {
      "concept_text": "To answer this question, note that this critical thinking challenges our knowledge through the use of advanced vocabulary terms; therefore, it is useful to first acknowledge the definition of each option choice. Vitriolic means bitter or malicious, while evocative means revealing. Patronizing means condescending, and sympathetic means caring. Finally, provocative means offensive or, in some cases, inspiring. If we consider that the first paragraph of the text will, in all likelihood, set the tone for the rest of the passage, we should scan this portion of the text to determine which of the option choices matches the author’s tone. Paragraph 1 states: “As human intelligence and appetite evolved, so did our taste perception, which formed into a complicated system integrating the smell, texture, and temperature of what we eat into our central nervous system. The final product of this is a pristine experience of satiation that is too often taken for granted. The void of ancient threats in modern times has shaped our gustation into a medium for enjoyment rather than protection. Perhaps a closer investigation into the human sense of taste can help us appreciate it on a deeper level.” We can see above that the author informs us about the state of today’s unconscious dietary habits while simultaneously questioning these habits. This shows us that his tone is revealing rather than caring. Moreover, the author continues to describe various concepts throughout the passage, which supports the notion that his tone is evocative rather than sympathetic. By re–reviewing the definitions of the terms in the option choices, we can also eliminate “vitriolic,” “provocative,” and “patronizing,” as each implies an overtly negative tone on the part of the author, which is not evidenced in the passage. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A . Vitriolic – is incorrect because vitriolic means bitter and the author’s tone is evocative, not bitter. Option C . Patronizing – is incorrect because patronizing means condescending and the author’s tone is evocative, not condescending. Option D. Sympathetic – is incorrect because sympathetic means caring and the author’s tone is evocative, not caring. Option E. Provocative – is incorrect because provocative typically means offensive, and the author’s tone is evocative, not offensive.",

Cranial nerves 7, 9, and 10 are responsible for transporting the information from the mouth to the central nervous system, where it is then processed from an electrical potential to a palpable experience. Nerve 7 innervates the front region of the tongue, while nerve 9 innervates the midportion and the 10th nerve detects taste in the epiglottis.\n\n(7). There are several other components of taste worth mentioning. One such component is cranial nerve 5, which is responsible for relaying a number of sensations to the brain. Some of the aforementioned sensations include spiciness , which excites somatosensory fibers on the tongue when encountered with molecules of chili pepper, ginger, or horseradish, and numbness , which may also show up as the consequence of a sharp spice. Another is coolness , which is perceived as a temperature drop without any actual such drop occurring, and it is often accompanied by a minty taste. Two further examples are astringency, or a “ harsh taste” , which is often triggered by unripe foods, such as a banana or persimmon, and a metallic sense, which is perceived primarily because of medicine, blood, or a dental amalgam. Lastly, the sensation of fat is another component that can affect the flavor of food.\n\n(8). Individual sensory nerves originating from the tongue merge in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem. From here, the signal is passed to the thalamus before it is sent to the gustatory cortex in the brain. Akin to an engineer in a busy train station with many rails, the thalamus determines what lever must be pulled to ascertain the course of transmission. After the gustatory cortex receives the signal, its outward axons innervate into the amygdala . Finally, the amygdala makes the ultimate decision as to how the experience will be remembered when it turns the signal into memory.\n\n(9). The memory of food is a compilation of all the moving parts involved in flavor perception . Aside from taste, flavor also includes the integral smell of food. The olfactory system is somewhat more complicated than taste, simply because volatile compounds are much more diverse, hence requiring additional specialized receptors for detection. While we can detect a relatively limited number of ‘ taste perceptions ’, the olfactory system has roughly 400 variations of scent detectors, culminating in the production of about a trillion different odours. Notably, dogs have 300 million olfactory receptors, compared to the human count of 6 million. Ultimately, it is the total combination of aroma, taste, texture, and temperature that produces a flavor that implants itself in our memory.\n\n(10). The act of smelling begins with chemoreceptors embedded in the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. After gaseous molecules are filtered through the nose hairs, they begin to dissolve in the mucus. The odour is then deconstructed into substrates that bind to receptors on the olfactory sensory neurons and initiate the depolarization cascade. Located directly above the olfactory epithelium is the nasal bone, and above the nasal bone is the olfactory bulb, which is a structure that organizes and streamlines electrical communication from the nose to the brain. The action potential from several axons meets in the glomerulus, a congregation of primary sensory olfactory cells within the olfactory bulb. The glomerulus relays its integrated message onto another type of nerve called the “ mitral cell ,” which delivers the signal to higher regions of the brain.\n\n(11). The neurobiological perspective of food tendencies and preferences has profound impacts. As children, we form strong associations with our sensory experiences, especially taste. If a certain food, for instance, brussels sprouts, makes us feel disgusted, the amygdala will always aim to avoid the food at all costs, even if the brussels sprouts are roasted beautifully with just the right blend of spices. In the same vein, when children are exposed to rich, fatty foods at an early age and live in a household that endorses unhealthy eating habits, they will be conditioned to enjoy foods that taste good but are detrimental to their long-term health and wellbeing.\n\n(12). One of the greatest healthcare challenges we face today is discerning between good and bad sugars. It is known that white sugar and its refined forms are the root cause of the most prevalent diseases we face today, such as diabetes type II, cancer, and Alzheimer’s . Furthermore, excessive sugar intake disrupts our healthy metabolic cycle by increasing blood sugar, blood pressure, and fat storage . Consequently, the heart loses its capacity to deliver nutrients to vital organs. Malnourished cells give rise to stress, disease, and eventually uncontrollable health conditions. The simplest step we can take is to notice how white sugar and its refined analogues make us feel when we indulge in them in excess. Ultimately, an increased investment in our internal health elevates our well-being, appreciation, and joy in life."

      "text": "(1). Since the time of the earliest civilizations, human beings have used our sense of taste to classify food as nutritious or poisonous. For instance, while bitterness signaled a pernicious substance that was to be avoided, saltiness indicated a source of essential ions . As human intelligence and appetite evolved, so did our taste perception, which formed into a complicated system integrating the smell, texture, and temperature of what we eat into our central nervous system. The final product of this is a pristine experience of satiation that is too often taken for granted. The void of ancient threats in modern times has shaped our gustation into a medium for enjoyment rather than protection. Perhaps a closer investigation into the human sense of taste can help us appreciate it on a deeper level.\n\n(2). Our perception of taste begins with the many taste buds that are located throughout the tongue. There is a common misconception that the visible bumps on the tongue are taste buds, but these protrusions, known as lingual papillae , are actually where the taste buds are stored. Indeed, each papilla stores hundreds of taste buds. There are 4 types of papillae on the tongue, but the 3 equipped with the specific machinery to interpret taste are known as fungiform papillae, foliate papillae, and circumvallate papillae . Fungiform papillae are located towards the front region of the tongue, while foliate papillae line the lateral portion of the tongue, and circumvallate papillae are found towards the posterior region of the tongue. In addition to the misunderstanding regarding location of the taste buds mentioned above, there is another misconception that certain areas of the tongue detect different tastes. This concept is usually found in high school biology textbooks and is based on one of the earliest (but flawed) experiments in gustation. In truth, each taste bud has the capacity to detect all the major taste categories, which are saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, and umami . A second class of supporting stem cells is housed in the posterior region of each taste bud. As taste cells are subject to damage through heat or other stimuli, the aforementioned stem cells regularly replace old gustatory cells so that our sense of taste is kept sharp.\n\n(3). Similar to our sense of smell, our sense of taste is modulated by chemoreceptors . In between the papillae are openings called “ pores ,” which allow for the entry of food chemicals. Once a food molecule passes through one of these pores, it encounters gustation hairs (these are microvilli structures that trap molecules and, much like a broom, sweep them towards the chemoreceptors on the exterior surface of taste buds). Without exception, each taste bud contains an assortment of between 50 and 100 distinct taste -detecting cells. The gustation cells are distinguished by their receptors and axonal destination; however, they all depend on the depolarization of their intracellular matrix to elicit an action potential.\n\n(4). Depolarization is the process by which nerve cells receive and relay information. A typical nervous cell holds a resting potential of -70 mV and a threshold potential of -55 mV. Once the interior of the cell is depolarized by an influx of positive ions beyond the threshold, a signal is fired toward the next nervous nexus . In taste cells, following the binding of a substrate to the chemoreceptors, ionic channels on the membrane, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and endoplasmic reticular calcium, are opened. The action potential is relayed from the axonal connections of the gustation cells to synapse with the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem.\n\n(5). The depolarization process has two variations . In the first, the sweet, umami, and bitter cells have G-protein-coupled receptors that first become bound by a given food chemical (glucose is one example of such a chemical), then, through a secondary messenger pathway membrane, ion channels open to induce depolarization. In the second variation, the salt and sour gustatory cells have ion channels on their membrane that open in direct response to substrate binding, causing an immediate depolarization and firing of an action potential. While the depolarization mechanism of the gustatory cells may vary, the action potential is predictable in the fact that it leads to the release of neurotransmitters that are then carried to the base of the brain via afferent nerves.\n\n(6). Once an action potential threshold is reached in gustatory cells, these cells release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft of afferent neurons located in the base of the brain.

      "title": "Passage 2",
      "text": "(1). Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori) is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium. The gram-negative classification is in reference to the fact that the bacterium's cell envelope is made up of an inner membrane, cell wall, and outer membrane, compared to a gram-positive bacterium, which has a cell envelope made from only an inner membrane and cell wall. These bacteria are classified as microaerophiles , meaning oxygen is crucial for their ability to function. However, the amount of oxygen they require is less than that found normally in the earth's atmosphere (~21%). Attached to their simple rod-shaped body (3μm by 0.5μm) is anywhere from four to eight flagella, which have a primary function of motility. Another characteristic of these bacteria is that they can form biofilms , which are the result of many microorganisms adhering to a solid surface and releasing an extracellular complex that provides protection from the environment.\n\n(2). H. Pylori was discovered by Australian scientists Barry J. Marshall and Robin Warren in 1982 . However, their discovery of the bacteria and report on its relation to peptic ulcer formation went against the conventional wisdom of the time and was thus met with much scrutiny. The common belief at the time was that peptic ulcer disease was caused by lifestyle factors such as stress. As such, Marshall and Warren’s findings showing that a bacterium played a major role in ulcer formation took many years to be widely accepted. To prove to the scientific community that H. Pylori did in fact play a major role in gastric illness, Barry J. Marshall created a unique experiment that involved intentionally infecting himself with the bacteria, causing him to get gastritis, (inflammation of the stomach lining). By conducting this experiment and following the strict scientific method of Koch's postulate, Marshall was able to demonstrate H. Pylori’s role in gastritis. Eventually, the role of H. Pylori in both gastritis and peptic ulcer formation led Marshall and Warren to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 2005.\n\n(3). The scientific name Helicobacter Pylori is the proper binomial nomenclature name unique to this organism. Helicobacter is the Genus name, while Pylori is the species name. There are about 35 other bacteria that share the Helicobacter genus, all of which have a few commonalities. Helicobacter anseris is also a gram-negative microaerophile and is quite unique, as it was first discovered in Canadian Geese feces in 2006 by researchers out of MIT. Helicobacter bilis, like Helicobacter anseris , has a unique origin story as it was first isolated in a 47-year-old man who had been experiencing a one-month bout of diarrhea and abdominal pain. Most of the species of Helicobacter, including Pylori, anseris, and bilis, can prosper in very acidic environments, giving better insight into which environments these bacteria are commonly found.\n\n(4). Helicobacter Pylori is commonly found in over 50% of the world’s population, and given the bacteria's affinity for acidic environments, it is usually found in the stomach . The reason that these bacteria can survive such harsh acidic environments is because they have several adaptations . First, to avoid extreme acidic locations, they can bury themselves into the mucosal layer of the stomach, which, although still an acidic environment, is less acidic than outside the lining. They can also move from an environment that is too acidic to a less acidic environment through the process of chemotaxis . Chemotaxis refers to the ability of an organism to use special receptors to sense the amount of chemicals in its environment; if the amount is not optimal, it can move to a more suitable area. Helicobacter Pylori can sense the pH of the surrounding environment, and then use its flagella to move to the abovementioned mucosal layer. An additional adaption includes the production of an enzyme called urease , which can convert the acid in an environment into CO 2 and ammonia, therefore neutralizing the acidic environment. However, an interesting statistic to note is that, of the people that are affected by these bacteria, 80% show no signs of illness. Nonetheless, that leaves an unfortunate 20% suffering from severe symptoms that can cause extreme harm and pain.\n\n(5). H. Pylori can cause issues to humans through the stomach in several ways. One of those is ammonia , which is a by-product of the urease enzyme. Ammonia is very toxic to the cells of the stomach lining and can therefore cause inflammation. If enough of these bacteria colonize the stomach lining, a person can develop chronic inflammation, also known as chronic gastritis . Symptoms of chronic gastritis include upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. If the inflammation caused by H. Pylori is extreme enough, stomach acid and certain peptide digestive enzymes in the stomach may hinder the function of mechanisms that normally protect the stomach lining, causing ulcers to form. The symptoms of ulcers can be as extreme as a burning sensation in the stomach, fatty food intolerance, heartburn, and nausea . There are two common types of ulcers caused by H. Pylori, both of which can occur in the upper GI tract. First is a gastric ulcer which occurs only inside the stomach, as previously mentioned. However, the bacteria can also invade the upper portion of the duodenum, which is part of the small intestine and directly ventral to the stomach; the ulcers formed in this region are called duodenal ulcers. People with ulcers can be in excruciating pain, though there are different forms of treatment available for those suffering.\n\n(6). Treatments for ulcers usually begin with one week of \" triple therapy ” which, as the name suggests, consists of three different medications. The first medication is a proton pump inhibitor , which stops the secretion of acid, therefore relieving some of the initial pain. The next two parts of the \"triple therapy\" are a combination of antibiotics , such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin. Clarithromycin works on H. Pylori by binding and inhibiting a part of its ribosome, thus inhibiting its ability to make proteins. Amoxicillin , on the other hand, works through another mechanism; much like penicillin, it can inhibit the synthesis of the cell wall for H. Pylori. If this treatment fails, then another treatment shown to be effective involves the patient consuming another type of bacteria, this being a lactic acid bacterium that can suppress H. Pylori. However, the growing concern with the traditional methods of treatment is that the continuous use of antibiotics to fight H. Pylori is leading to the development of antibiotic-resistant H. Pylori. The more a given antibiotic is being administered to patients (such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin) the more bacteria can develop/transfer plasmids , which counteract antibiotics, thus leaving them ineffective. Hence, one of the key reasons to stop the initial infection of H . Pylori is so that treatment isn't necessary.\n\n(7). Current research is being done to find preventative measures to stop H. Pylori, therefore eradicating the need for treatments such as antibiotics. One of the major areas of research is looking at vaccinations. Researchers at the University of York in England looked at another aspect of preventative medicine by examining the Netherlands, and how vaccines for H. Pylori would have economic benefits, as the cost of a vaccine would be less than that of the constant treatments needed throughout the life of a patient. This shows that something as simple as a bacterium can influence many different aspects of the world, not just the health and safety of citizens. To come up with viable solutions to prevent and treat issues caused by H. Pylori, it is crucial to look at aspects such as the economic effects, social ramifications, and ethical issues when testing certain drugs and vaccines. A bacterium like Helicobacter Pylori , and the issues it causes to humans, show that antibiotic resistance is a serious issue; as such, to ultimately reduce the cases of gastritis and ulcers, researchers must look towards preventative treatments. Researchers from all fields must work together to come up with viable solutions that are medically effective, while also cost-effective and ethical in nature."

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we should first note that the discovery of H. Pylori’s role in gastritis constitutes basic information regarding the topic of H. Pylori. Therefore, we can presume that the section discussing it will be found early in the passage. Indeed, paragraph 2 contains the relevant information: “To prove to the scientific community that H. Pylori did in fact play a major role in gastric illness, Barry J. Marshall created a unique experiment that involved intentionally infecting himself with the bacteria, causing him to get gastritis, (inflammation of the stomach lining). By conducting this experiment and following the strict scientific method of Koch's postulate, Marshall was able to demonstrate H. Pylori’s role in gastritis.” Next, we should consider the context in which the experiment leading to the discovery of H. Pylori’s role in gastritis is discussed. If we note that the author uses the word “unique” to describe this experiment, we can then determine that the author believes that it was unorthodox . Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Dangerous – is incorrect because dangerous means likely to cause harm. This word better describes the nature of H.Pylori, not the process by which its role in gastritis was proven. Option C. Pre-emptive – is incorrect because this means to take a measure against something that is feared. The process by which H. Pylori’s role in gastritis was proven was not to prevent something - thus, this is incorrect. Option D. Invaluable – is incorrect because this means valuable beyond estimation. This word better describes the effect of the experiment rather than the process by which H. Pylori’s role in gastritis was proven. Option E. Reactive – is incorrect because this means acting in response to a stimulus. This word doesn’t fit the context – thus, this is incorrect.",

      "text": "(1). Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori) is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium. The gram-negative classification is in reference to the fact that the bacterium's cell envelope is made up of an inner membrane, cell wall, and outer membrane, compared to a gram-positive bacterium, which has a cell envelope made from only an inner membrane and cell wall. These bacteria are classified as microaerophiles , meaning oxygen is crucial for their ability to function. However, the amount of oxygen they require is less than that found normally in the earth's atmosphere (~21%). Attached to their simple rod-shaped body (3μm by 0.5μm) is anywhere from four to eight flagella, which have a primary function of motility. Another characteristic of these bacteria is that they can form biofilms , which are the result of many microorganisms adhering to a solid surface and releasing an extracellular complex that provides protection from the environment.\n\n(2). H. Pylori was discovered by Australian scientists Barry J. Marshall and Robin Warren in 1982 . However, their discovery of the bacteria and report on its relation to peptic ulcer formation went against the conventional wisdom of the time and was thus met with much scrutiny. The common belief at the time was that peptic ulcer disease was caused by lifestyle factors such as stress. As such, Marshall and Warren’s findings showing that a bacterium played a major role in ulcer formation took many years to be widely accepted. To prove to the scientific community that H. Pylori did in fact play a major role in gastric illness, Barry J. Marshall created a unique experiment that involved intentionally infecting himself with the bacteria, causing him to get gastritis, (inflammation of the stomach lining). By conducting this experiment and following the strict scientific method of Koch's postulate, Marshall was able to demonstrate H. Pylori’s role in gastritis. Eventually, the role of H. Pylori in both gastritis and peptic ulcer formation led Marshall and Warren to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 2005.\n\n(3). The scientific name Helicobacter Pylori is the proper binomial nomenclature name unique to this organism. Helicobacter is the Genus name, while Pylori is the species name. There are about 35 other bacteria that share the Helicobacter genus, all of which have a few commonalities. Helicobacter anseris is also a gram-negative microaerophile and is quite unique, as it was first discovered in Canadian Geese feces in 2006 by researchers out of MIT. Helicobacter bilis, like Helicobacter anseris , has a unique origin story as it was first isolated in a 47-year-old man who had been experiencing a one-month bout of diarrhea and abdominal pain. Most of the species of Helicobacter, including Pylori, anseris, and bilis, can prosper in very acidic environments, giving better insight into which environments these bacteria are commonly found.\n\n(4). Helicobacter Pylori is commonly found in over 50% of the world’s population, and given the bacteria's affinity for acidic environments, it is usually found in the stomach . The reason that these bacteria can survive such harsh acidic environments is because they have several adaptations . First, to avoid extreme acidic locations, they can bury themselves into the mucosal layer of the stomach, which, although still an acidic environment, is less acidic than outside the lining. They can also move from an environment that is too acidic to a less acidic environment through the process of chemotaxis . Chemotaxis refers to the ability of an organism to use special receptors to sense the amount of chemicals in its environment; if the amount is not optimal, it can move to a more suitable area. Helicobacter Pylori can sense the pH of the surrounding environment, and then use its flagella to move to the abovementioned mucosal layer. An additional adaption includes the production of an enzyme called urease , which can convert the acid in an environment into CO 2 and ammonia, therefore neutralizing the acidic environment. However, an interesting statistic to note is that, of the people that are affected by these bacteria, 80% show no signs of illness. Nonetheless, that leaves an unfortunate 20% suffering from severe symptoms that can cause extreme harm and pain.\n\n(5). H. Pylori can cause issues to humans through the stomach in several ways. One of those is ammonia , which is a by-product of the urease enzyme. Ammonia is very toxic to the cells of the stomach lining and can therefore cause inflammation. If enough of these bacteria colonize the stomach lining, a person can develop chronic inflammation, also known as chronic gastritis . Symptoms of chronic gastritis include upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. If the inflammation caused by H. Pylori is extreme enough, stomach acid and certain peptide digestive enzymes in the stomach may hinder the function of mechanisms that normally protect the stomach lining, causing ulcers to form. The symptoms of ulcers can be as extreme as a burning sensation in the stomach, fatty food intolerance, heartburn, and nausea . There are two common types of ulcers caused by H. Pylori, both of which can occur in the upper GI tract. First is a gastric ulcer which occurs only inside the stomach, as previously mentioned. However, the bacteria can also invade the upper portion of the duodenum, which is part of the small intestine and directly ventral to the stomach; the ulcers formed in this region are called duodenal ulcers. People with ulcers can be in excruciating pain, though there are different forms of treatment available for those suffering.\n\n(6). Treatments for ulcers usually begin with one week of \" triple therapy ” which, as the name suggests, consists of three different medications. The first medication is a proton pump inhibitor , which stops the secretion of acid, therefore relieving some of the initial pain. The next two parts of the \"triple therapy\" are a combination of antibiotics , such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin. Clarithromycin works on H. Pylori by binding and inhibiting a part of its ribosome, thus inhibiting its ability to make proteins. Amoxicillin , on the other hand, works through another mechanism; much like penicillin, it can inhibit the synthesis of the cell wall for H. Pylori. If this treatment fails, then another treatment shown to be effective involves the patient consuming another type of bacteria, this being a lactic acid bacterium that can suppress H. Pylori. However, the growing concern with the traditional methods of treatment is that the continuous use of antibiotics to fight H. Pylori is leading to the development of antibiotic-resistant H. Pylori. The more a given antibiotic is being administered to patients (such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin) the more bacteria can develop/transfer plasmids , which counteract antibiotics, thus leaving them ineffective. Hence, one of the key reasons to stop the initial infection of H . Pylori is so that treatment isn't necessary.\n\n(7). Current research is being done to find preventative measures to stop H. Pylori, therefore eradicating the need for treatments such as antibiotics. One of the major areas of research is looking at vaccinations. Researchers at the University of York in England looked at another aspect of preventative medicine by examining the Netherlands, and how vaccines for H. Pylori would have economic benefits, as the cost of a vaccine would be less than that of the constant treatments needed throughout the life of a patient. This shows that something as simple as a bacterium can influence many different aspects of the world, not just the health and safety of citizens. To come up with viable solutions to prevent and treat issues caused by H. Pylori, it is crucial to look at aspects such as the economic effects, social ramifications, and ethical issues when testing certain drugs and vaccines. A bacterium like Helicobacter Pylori , and the issues it causes to humans, show that antibiotic resistance is a serious issue; as such, to ultimately reduce the cases of gastritis and ulcers, researchers must look towards preventative treatments. Researchers from all fields must work together to come up with viable solutions that are medically effective, while also cost-effective and ethical in nature."

      "text": "(1). Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori) is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium. The gram-negative classification is in reference to the fact that the bacterium's cell envelope is made up of an inner membrane, cell wall, and outer membrane, compared to a gram-positive bacterium, which has a cell envelope made from only an inner membrane and cell wall. These bacteria are classified as microaerophiles , meaning oxygen is crucial for their ability to function. However, the amount of oxygen they require is less than that found normally in the earth's atmosphere (~21%). Attached to their simple rod-shaped body (3μm by 0.5μm) is anywhere from four to eight flagella, which have a primary function of motility. Another characteristic of these bacteria is that they can form biofilms , which are the result of many microorganisms adhering to a solid surface and releasing an extracellular complex that provides protection from the environment.\n\n(2). H. Pylori was discovered by Australian scientists Barry J. Marshall and Robin Warren in 1982 . However, their discovery of the bacteria and report on its relation to peptic ulcer formation went against the conventional wisdom of the time and was thus met with much scrutiny. The common belief at the time was that peptic ulcer disease was caused by lifestyle factors such as stress. As such, Marshall and Warren’s findings showing that a bacterium played a major role in ulcer formation took many years to be widely accepted. To prove to the scientific community that H. Pylori did in fact play a major role in gastric illness, Barry J. Marshall created a unique experiment that involved intentionally infecting himself with the bacteria, causing him to get gastritis, (inflammation of the stomach lining). By conducting this experiment and following the strict scientific method of Koch's postulate, Marshall was able to demonstrate H. Pylori’s role in gastritis. Eventually, the role of H. Pylori in both gastritis and peptic ulcer formation led Marshall and Warren to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 2005.\n\n(3). The scientific name Helicobacter Pylori is the proper binomial nomenclature name unique to this organism. Helicobacter is the Genus name, while Pylori is the species name. There are about 35 other bacteria that share the Helicobacter genus, all of which have a few commonalities. Helicobacter anseris is also a gram-negative microaerophile and is quite unique, as it was first discovered in Canadian Geese feces in 2006 by researchers out of MIT. Helicobacter bilis, like Helicobacter anseris , has a unique origin story as it was first isolated in a 47-year-old man who had been experiencing a one-month bout of diarrhea and abdominal pain. Most of the species of Helicobacter, including Pylori, anseris, and bilis, can prosper in very acidic environments, giving better insight into which environments these bacteria are commonly found.\n\n(4). Helicobacter Pylori is commonly found in over 50% of the world’s population, and given the bacteria's affinity for acidic environments, it is usually found in the stomach . The reason that these bacteria can survive such harsh acidic environments is because they have several adaptations . First, to avoid extreme acidic locations, they can bury themselves into the mucosal layer of the stomach, which, although still an acidic environment, is less acidic than outside the lining. They can also move from an environment that is too acidic to a less acidic environment through the process of chemotaxis . Chemotaxis refers to the ability of an organism to use special receptors to sense the amount of chemicals in its environment; if the amount is not optimal, it can move to a more suitable area. Helicobacter Pylori can sense the pH of the surrounding environment, and then use its flagella to move to the abovementioned mucosal layer. An additional adaption includes the production of an enzyme called urease , which can convert the acid in an environment into CO 2 and ammonia, therefore neutralizing the acidic environment. However, an interesting statistic to note is that, of the people that are affected by these bacteria, 80% show no signs of illness. Nonetheless, that leaves an unfortunate 20% suffering from severe symptoms that can cause extreme harm and pain.\n\n(5). H. Pylori can cause issues to humans through the stomach in several ways. One of those is ammonia , which is a by-product of the urease enzyme. Ammonia is very toxic to the cells of the stomach lining and can therefore cause inflammation. If enough of these bacteria colonize the stomach lining, a person can develop chronic inflammation, also known as chronic gastritis . Symptoms of chronic gastritis include upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. If the inflammation caused by H. Pylori is extreme enough, stomach acid and certain peptide digestive enzymes in the stomach may hinder the function of mechanisms that normally protect the stomach lining, causing ulcers to form. The symptoms of ulcers can be as extreme as a burning sensation in the stomach, fatty food intolerance, heartburn, and nausea . There are two common types of ulcers caused by H. Pylori, both of which can occur in the upper GI tract. First is a gastric ulcer which occurs only inside the stomach, as previously mentioned. However, the bacteria can also invade the upper portion of the duodenum, which is part of the small intestine and directly ventral to the stomach; the ulcers formed in this region are called duodenal ulcers. People with ulcers can be in excruciating pain, though there are different forms of treatment available for those suffering.\n\n(6). Treatments for ulcers usually begin with one week of \" triple therapy ” which, as the name suggests, consists of three different medications. The first medication is a proton pump inhibitor , which stops the secretion of acid, therefore relieving some of the initial pain. The next two parts of the \"triple therapy\" are a combination of antibiotics , such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin. Clarithromycin works on H. Pylori by binding and inhibiting a part of its ribosome, thus inhibiting its ability to make proteins. Amoxicillin , on the other hand, works through another mechanism; much like penicillin, it can inhibit the synthesis of the cell wall for H. Pylori. If this treatment fails, then another treatment shown to be effective involves the patient consuming another type of bacteria, this being a lactic acid bacterium that can suppress H. Pylori. However, the growing concern with the traditional methods of treatment is that the continuous use of antibiotics to fight H. Pylori is leading to the development of antibiotic-resistant H. Pylori. The more a given antibiotic is being administered to patients (such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin) the more bacteria can develop/transfer plasmids , which counteract antibiotics, thus leaving them ineffective. Hence, one of the key reasons to stop the initial infection of H . Pylori is so that treatment isn't necessary.\n\n(7). Current research is being done to find preventative measures to stop H. Pylori, therefore eradicating the need for treatments such as antibiotics. One of the major areas of research is looking at vaccinations. Researchers at the University of York in England looked at another aspect of preventative medicine by examining the Netherlands, and how vaccines for H. Pylori would have economic benefits, as the cost of a vaccine would be less than that of the constant treatments needed throughout the life of a patient. This shows that something as simple as a bacterium can influence many different aspects of the world, not just the health and safety of citizens. To come up with viable solutions to prevent and treat issues caused by H. Pylori, it is crucial to look at aspects such as the economic effects, social ramifications, and ethical issues when testing certain drugs and vaccines. A bacterium like Helicobacter Pylori , and the issues it causes to humans, show that antibiotic resistance is a serious issue; as such, to ultimately reduce the cases of gastritis and ulcers, researchers must look towards preventative treatments. Researchers from all fields must work together to come up with viable solutions that are medically effective, while also cost-effective and ethical in nature."

People with ulcers can be in excruciating pain, though there are different forms of treatment available for those suffering.\n\n(6). Treatments for ulcers usually begin with one week of \" triple therapy ” which, as the name suggests, consists of three different medications. The first medication is a proton pump inhibitor , which stops the secretion of acid, therefore relieving some of the initial pain. The next two parts of the \"triple therapy\" are a combination of antibiotics , such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin. Clarithromycin works on H. Pylori by binding and inhibiting a part of its ribosome, thus inhibiting its ability to make proteins. Amoxicillin , on the other hand, works through another mechanism; much like penicillin, it can inhibit the synthesis of the cell wall for H. Pylori. If this treatment fails, then another treatment shown to be effective involves the patient consuming another type of bacteria, this being a lactic acid bacterium that can suppress H. Pylori. However, the growing concern with the traditional methods of treatment is that the continuous use of antibiotics to fight H. Pylori is leading to the development of antibiotic-resistant H. Pylori. The more a given antibiotic is being administered to patients (such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin) the more bacteria can develop/transfer plasmids , which counteract antibiotics, thus leaving them ineffective. Hence, one of the key reasons to stop the initial infection of H . Pylori is so that treatment isn't necessary.\n\n(7). Current research is being done to find preventative measures to stop H. Pylori, therefore eradicating the need for treatments such as antibiotics. One of the major areas of research is looking at vaccinations. Researchers at the University of York in England looked at another aspect of preventative medicine by examining the Netherlands, and how vaccines for H. Pylori would have economic benefits, as the cost of a vaccine would be less than that of the constant treatments needed throughout the life of a patient. This shows that something as simple as a bacterium can influence many different aspects of the world, not just the health and safety of citizens. To come up with viable solutions to prevent and treat issues caused by H. Pylori, it is crucial to look at aspects such as the economic effects, social ramifications, and ethical issues when testing certain drugs and vaccines. A bacterium like Helicobacter Pylori , and the issues it causes to humans, show that antibiotic resistance is a serious issue; as such, to ultimately reduce the cases of gastritis and ulcers, researchers must look towards preventative treatments. Researchers from all fields must work together to come up with viable solutions that are medically effective, while also cost-effective and ethical in nature."

      "text": "(1). Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori) is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium. The gram-negative classification is in reference to the fact that the bacterium's cell envelope is made up of an inner membrane, cell wall, and outer membrane, compared to a gram-positive bacterium, which has a cell envelope made from only an inner membrane and cell wall. These bacteria are classified as microaerophiles , meaning oxygen is crucial for their ability to function. However, the amount of oxygen they require is less than that found normally in the earth's atmosphere (~21%). Attached to their simple rod-shaped body (3μm by 0.5μm) is anywhere from four to eight flagella, which have a primary function of motility. Another characteristic of these bacteria is that they can form biofilms , which are the result of many microorganisms adhering to a solid surface and releasing an extracellular complex that provides protection from the environment.\n\n(2). H. Pylori was discovered by Australian scientists Barry J. Marshall and Robin Warren in 1982 . However, their discovery of the bacteria and report on its relation to peptic ulcer formation went against the conventional wisdom of the time and was thus met with much scrutiny. The common belief at the time was that peptic ulcer disease was caused by lifestyle factors such as stress. As such, Marshall and Warren’s findings showing that a bacterium played a major role in ulcer formation took many years to be widely accepted. To prove to the scientific community that H. Pylori did in fact play a major role in gastric illness, Barry J. Marshall created a unique experiment that involved intentionally infecting himself with the bacteria, causing him to get gastritis, (inflammation of the stomach lining). By conducting this experiment and following the strict scientific method of Koch's postulate, Marshall was able to demonstrate H. Pylori’s role in gastritis. Eventually, the role of H. Pylori in both gastritis and peptic ulcer formation led Marshall and Warren to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 2005.\n\n(3). The scientific name Helicobacter Pylori is the proper binomial nomenclature name unique to this organism. Helicobacter is the Genus name, while Pylori is the species name. There are about 35 other bacteria that share the Helicobacter genus, all of which have a few commonalities. Helicobacter anseris is also a gram-negative microaerophile and is quite unique, as it was first discovered in Canadian Geese feces in 2006 by researchers out of MIT. Helicobacter bilis, like Helicobacter anseris , has a unique origin story as it was first isolated in a 47-year-old man who had been experiencing a one-month bout of diarrhea and abdominal pain. Most of the species of Helicobacter, including Pylori, anseris, and bilis, can prosper in very acidic environments, giving better insight into which environments these bacteria are commonly found.\n\n(4). Helicobacter Pylori is commonly found in over 50% of the world’s population, and given the bacteria's affinity for acidic environments, it is usually found in the stomach . The reason that these bacteria can survive such harsh acidic environments is because they have several adaptations . First, to avoid extreme acidic locations, they can bury themselves into the mucosal layer of the stomach, which, although still an acidic environment, is less acidic than outside the lining. They can also move from an environment that is too acidic to a less acidic environment through the process of chemotaxis . Chemotaxis refers to the ability of an organism to use special receptors to sense the amount of chemicals in its environment; if the amount is not optimal, it can move to a more suitable area. Helicobacter Pylori can sense the pH of the surrounding environment, and then use its flagella to move to the abovementioned mucosal layer. An additional adaption includes the production of an enzyme called urease , which can convert the acid in an environment into CO 2 and ammonia, therefore neutralizing the acidic environment. However, an interesting statistic to note is that, of the people that are affected by these bacteria, 80% show no signs of illness. Nonetheless, that leaves an unfortunate 20% suffering from severe symptoms that can cause extreme harm and pain.\n\n(5). H. Pylori can cause issues to humans through the stomach in several ways. One of those is ammonia , which is a by-product of the urease enzyme. Ammonia is very toxic to the cells of the stomach lining and can therefore cause inflammation. If enough of these bacteria colonize the stomach lining, a person can develop chronic inflammation, also known as chronic gastritis . Symptoms of chronic gastritis include upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. If the inflammation caused by H. Pylori is extreme enough, stomach acid and certain peptide digestive enzymes in the stomach may hinder the function of mechanisms that normally protect the stomach lining, causing ulcers to form. The symptoms of ulcers can be as extreme as a burning sensation in the stomach, fatty food intolerance, heartburn, and nausea . There are two common types of ulcers caused by H. Pylori, both of which can occur in the upper GI tract. First is a gastric ulcer which occurs only inside the stomach, as previously mentioned. However, the bacteria can also invade the upper portion of the duodenum, which is part of the small intestine and directly ventral to the stomach; the ulcers formed in this region are called duodenal ulcers.

An additional adaption includes the production of an enzyme called urease , which can convert the acid in an environment into CO 2 and ammonia, therefore neutralizing the acidic environment. However, an interesting statistic to note is that, of the people that are affected by these bacteria, 80% show no signs of illness. Nonetheless, that leaves an unfortunate 20% suffering from severe symptoms that can cause extreme harm and pain.\n\n(5). H. Pylori can cause issues to humans through the stomach in several ways. One of those is ammonia , which is a by-product of the urease enzyme. Ammonia is very toxic to the cells of the stomach lining and can therefore cause inflammation. If enough of these bacteria colonize the stomach lining, a person can develop chronic inflammation, also known as chronic gastritis . Symptoms of chronic gastritis include upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. If the inflammation caused by H. Pylori is extreme enough, stomach acid and certain peptide digestive enzymes in the stomach may hinder the function of mechanisms that normally protect the stomach lining, causing ulcers to form. The symptoms of ulcers can be as extreme as a burning sensation in the stomach, fatty food intolerance, heartburn, and nausea . There are two common types of ulcers caused by H. Pylori, both of which can occur in the upper GI tract. First is a gastric ulcer which occurs only inside the stomach, as previously mentioned. However, the bacteria can also invade the upper portion of the duodenum, which is part of the small intestine and directly ventral to the stomach; the ulcers formed in this region are called duodenal ulcers. People with ulcers can be in excruciating pain, though there are different forms of treatment available for those suffering.\n\n(6). Treatments for ulcers usually begin with one week of \" triple therapy ” which, as the name suggests, consists of three different medications. The first medication is a proton pump inhibitor , which stops the secretion of acid, therefore relieving some of the initial pain. The next two parts of the \"triple therapy\" are a combination of antibiotics , such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin. Clarithromycin works on H. Pylori by binding and inhibiting a part of its ribosome, thus inhibiting its ability to make proteins. Amoxicillin , on the other hand, works through another mechanism; much like penicillin, it can inhibit the synthesis of the cell wall for H. Pylori. If this treatment fails, then another treatment shown to be effective involves the patient consuming another type of bacteria, this being a lactic acid bacterium that can suppress H. Pylori. However, the growing concern with the traditional methods of treatment is that the continuous use of antibiotics to fight H. Pylori is leading to the development of antibiotic-resistant H. Pylori. The more a given antibiotic is being administered to patients (such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin) the more bacteria can develop/transfer plasmids , which counteract antibiotics, thus leaving them ineffective. Hence, one of the key reasons to stop the initial infection of H . Pylori is so that treatment isn't necessary.\n\n(7). Current research is being done to find preventative measures to stop H. Pylori, therefore eradicating the need for treatments such as antibiotics. One of the major areas of research is looking at vaccinations. Researchers at the University of York in England looked at another aspect of preventative medicine by examining the Netherlands, and how vaccines for H. Pylori would have economic benefits, as the cost of a vaccine would be less than that of the constant treatments needed throughout the life of a patient. This shows that something as simple as a bacterium can influence many different aspects of the world, not just the health and safety of citizens. To come up with viable solutions to prevent and treat issues caused by H. Pylori, it is crucial to look at aspects such as the economic effects, social ramifications, and ethical issues when testing certain drugs and vaccines. A bacterium like Helicobacter Pylori , and the issues it causes to humans, show that antibiotic resistance is a serious issue; as such, to ultimately reduce the cases of gastritis and ulcers, researchers must look towards preventative treatments. Researchers from all fields must work together to come up with viable solutions that are medically effective, while also cost-effective and ethical in nature."

      "text": "(1). Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori) is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium. The gram-negative classification is in reference to the fact that the bacterium's cell envelope is made up of an inner membrane, cell wall, and outer membrane, compared to a gram-positive bacterium, which has a cell envelope made from only an inner membrane and cell wall. These bacteria are classified as microaerophiles , meaning oxygen is crucial for their ability to function. However, the amount of oxygen they require is less than that found normally in the earth's atmosphere (~21%). Attached to their simple rod-shaped body (3μm by 0.5μm) is anywhere from four to eight flagella, which have a primary function of motility. Another characteristic of these bacteria is that they can form biofilms , which are the result of many microorganisms adhering to a solid surface and releasing an extracellular complex that provides protection from the environment.\n\n(2). H. Pylori was discovered by Australian scientists Barry J. Marshall and Robin Warren in 1982 . However, their discovery of the bacteria and report on its relation to peptic ulcer formation went against the conventional wisdom of the time and was thus met with much scrutiny. The common belief at the time was that peptic ulcer disease was caused by lifestyle factors such as stress. As such, Marshall and Warren’s findings showing that a bacterium played a major role in ulcer formation took many years to be widely accepted. To prove to the scientific community that H. Pylori did in fact play a major role in gastric illness, Barry J. Marshall created a unique experiment that involved intentionally infecting himself with the bacteria, causing him to get gastritis, (inflammation of the stomach lining). By conducting this experiment and following the strict scientific method of Koch's postulate, Marshall was able to demonstrate H. Pylori’s role in gastritis. Eventually, the role of H. Pylori in both gastritis and peptic ulcer formation led Marshall and Warren to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 2005.\n\n(3). The scientific name Helicobacter Pylori is the proper binomial nomenclature name unique to this organism. Helicobacter is the Genus name, while Pylori is the species name. There are about 35 other bacteria that share the Helicobacter genus, all of which have a few commonalities. Helicobacter anseris is also a gram-negative microaerophile and is quite unique, as it was first discovered in Canadian Geese feces in 2006 by researchers out of MIT. Helicobacter bilis, like Helicobacter anseris , has a unique origin story as it was first isolated in a 47-year-old man who had been experiencing a one-month bout of diarrhea and abdominal pain. Most of the species of Helicobacter, including Pylori, anseris, and bilis, can prosper in very acidic environments, giving better insight into which environments these bacteria are commonly found.\n\n(4). Helicobacter Pylori is commonly found in over 50% of the world’s population, and given the bacteria's affinity for acidic environments, it is usually found in the stomach . The reason that these bacteria can survive such harsh acidic environments is because they have several adaptations . First, to avoid extreme acidic locations, they can bury themselves into the mucosal layer of the stomach, which, although still an acidic environment, is less acidic than outside the lining. They can also move from an environment that is too acidic to a less acidic environment through the process of chemotaxis .

The scientific name Helicobacter Pylori is the proper binomial nomenclature name unique to this organism. Helicobacter is the Genus name, while Pylori is the species name. There are about 35 other bacteria that share the Helicobacter genus, all of which have a few commonalities. Helicobacter anseris is also a gram-negative microaerophile and is quite unique, as it was first discovered in Canadian Geese feces in 2006 by researchers out of MIT. Helicobacter bilis, like Helicobacter anseris , has a unique origin story as it was first isolated in a 47-year-old man who had been experiencing a one-month bout of diarrhea and abdominal pain. Most of the species of Helicobacter, including Pylori, anseris, and bilis, can prosper in very acidic environments, giving better insight into which environments these bacteria are commonly found.\n\n(4). Helicobacter Pylori is commonly found in over 50% of the world’s population, and given the bacteria's affinity for acidic environments, it is usually found in the stomach . The reason that these bacteria can survive such harsh acidic environments is because they have several adaptations . First, to avoid extreme acidic locations, they can bury themselves into the mucosal layer of the stomach, which, although still an acidic environment, is less acidic than outside the lining. They can also move from an environment that is too acidic to a less acidic environment through the process of chemotaxis . Chemotaxis refers to the ability of an organism to use special receptors to sense the amount of chemicals in its environment; if the amount is not optimal, it can move to a more suitable area. Helicobacter Pylori can sense the pH of the surrounding environment, and then use its flagella to move to the abovementioned mucosal layer. An additional adaption includes the production of an enzyme called urease , which can convert the acid in an environment into CO 2 and ammonia, therefore neutralizing the acidic environment. However, an interesting statistic to note is that, of the people that are affected by these bacteria, 80% show no signs of illness. Nonetheless, that leaves an unfortunate 20% suffering from severe symptoms that can cause extreme harm and pain.\n\n(5). H. Pylori can cause issues to humans through the stomach in several ways. One of those is ammonia , which is a by-product of the urease enzyme. Ammonia is very toxic to the cells of the stomach lining and can therefore cause inflammation. If enough of these bacteria colonize the stomach lining, a person can develop chronic inflammation, also known as chronic gastritis . Symptoms of chronic gastritis include upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. If the inflammation caused by H. Pylori is extreme enough, stomach acid and certain peptide digestive enzymes in the stomach may hinder the function of mechanisms that normally protect the stomach lining, causing ulcers to form. The symptoms of ulcers can be as extreme as a burning sensation in the stomach, fatty food intolerance, heartburn, and nausea . There are two common types of ulcers caused by H. Pylori, both of which can occur in the upper GI tract. First is a gastric ulcer which occurs only inside the stomach, as previously mentioned. However, the bacteria can also invade the upper portion of the duodenum, which is part of the small intestine and directly ventral to the stomach; the ulcers formed in this region are called duodenal ulcers. People with ulcers can be in excruciating pain, though there are different forms of treatment available for those suffering.\n\n(6). Treatments for ulcers usually begin with one week of \" triple therapy ” which, as the name suggests, consists of three different medications. The first medication is a proton pump inhibitor , which stops the secretion of acid, therefore relieving some of the initial pain. The next two parts of the \"triple therapy\" are a combination of antibiotics , such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin. Clarithromycin works on H. Pylori by binding and inhibiting a part of its ribosome, thus inhibiting its ability to make proteins. Amoxicillin , on the other hand, works through another mechanism; much like penicillin, it can inhibit the synthesis of the cell wall for H. Pylori. If this treatment fails, then another treatment shown to be effective involves the patient consuming another type of bacteria, this being a lactic acid bacterium that can suppress H. Pylori. However, the growing concern with the traditional methods of treatment is that the continuous use of antibiotics to fight H. Pylori is leading to the development of antibiotic-resistant H. Pylori. The more a given antibiotic is being administered to patients (such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin) the more bacteria can develop/transfer plasmids , which counteract antibiotics, thus leaving them ineffective. Hence, one of the key reasons to stop the initial infection of H . Pylori is so that treatment isn't necessary.\n\n(7). Current research is being done to find preventative measures to stop H. Pylori, therefore eradicating the need for treatments such as antibiotics. One of the major areas of research is looking at vaccinations. Researchers at the University of York in England looked at another aspect of preventative medicine by examining the Netherlands, and how vaccines for H. Pylori would have economic benefits, as the cost of a vaccine would be less than that of the constant treatments needed throughout the life of a patient. This shows that something as simple as a bacterium can influence many different aspects of the world, not just the health and safety of citizens. To come up with viable solutions to prevent and treat issues caused by H. Pylori, it is crucial to look at aspects such as the economic effects, social ramifications, and ethical issues when testing certain drugs and vaccines. A bacterium like Helicobacter Pylori , and the issues it causes to humans, show that antibiotic resistance is a serious issue; as such, to ultimately reduce the cases of gastritis and ulcers, researchers must look towards preventative treatments. Researchers from all fields must work together to come up with viable solutions that are medically effective, while also cost-effective and ethical in nature."

H. Pylori was discovered by Australian scientists Barry J. Marshall and Robin Warren in 1982 .

However, the amount of oxygen they require is less than that found normally in the earth's atmosphere (~21%). Attached to their simple rod-shaped body (3μm by 0.5μm) is anywhere from four to eight flagella, which have a primary function of motility. Another characteristic of these bacteria is that they can form biofilms , which are the result of many microorganisms adhering to a solid surface and releasing an extracellular complex that provides protection from the environment.\n\n(2). H. Pylori was discovered by Australian scientists Barry J. Marshall and Robin Warren in 1982 . However, their discovery of the bacteria and report on its relation to peptic ulcer formation went against the conventional wisdom of the time and was thus met with much scrutiny. The common belief at the time was that peptic ulcer disease was caused by lifestyle factors such as stress. As such, Marshall and Warren’s findings showing that a bacterium played a major role in ulcer formation took many years to be widely accepted. To prove to the scientific community that H. Pylori did in fact play a major role in gastric illness, Barry J. Marshall created a unique experiment that involved intentionally infecting himself with the bacteria, causing him to get gastritis, (inflammation of the stomach lining). By conducting this experiment and following the strict scientific method of Koch's postulate, Marshall was able to demonstrate H. Pylori’s role in gastritis. Eventually, the role of H. Pylori in both gastritis and peptic ulcer formation led Marshall and Warren to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 2005.\n\n(3). The scientific name Helicobacter Pylori is the proper binomial nomenclature name unique to this organism. Helicobacter is the Genus name, while Pylori is the species name. There are about 35 other bacteria that share the Helicobacter genus, all of which have a few commonalities. Helicobacter anseris is also a gram-negative microaerophile and is quite unique, as it was first discovered in Canadian Geese feces in 2006 by researchers out of MIT. Helicobacter bilis, like Helicobacter anseris , has a unique origin story as it was first isolated in a 47-year-old man who had been experiencing a one-month bout of diarrhea and abdominal pain. Most of the species of Helicobacter, including Pylori, anseris, and bilis, can prosper in very acidic environments, giving better insight into which environments these bacteria are commonly found.\n\n(4). Helicobacter Pylori is commonly found in over 50% of the world’s population, and given the bacteria's affinity for acidic environments, it is usually found in the stomach . The reason that these bacteria can survive such harsh acidic environments is because they have several adaptations . First, to avoid extreme acidic locations, they can bury themselves into the mucosal layer of the stomach, which, although still an acidic environment, is less acidic than outside the lining. They can also move from an environment that is too acidic to a less acidic environment through the process of chemotaxis . Chemotaxis refers to the ability of an organism to use special receptors to sense the amount of chemicals in its environment; if the amount is not optimal, it can move to a more suitable area. Helicobacter Pylori can sense the pH of the surrounding environment, and then use its flagella to move to the abovementioned mucosal layer. An additional adaption includes the production of an enzyme called urease , which can convert the acid in an environment into CO 2 and ammonia, therefore neutralizing the acidic environment. However, an interesting statistic to note is that, of the people that are affected by these bacteria, 80% show no signs of illness. Nonetheless, that leaves an unfortunate 20% suffering from severe symptoms that can cause extreme harm and pain.\n\n(5). H. Pylori can cause issues to humans through the stomach in several ways. One of those is ammonia , which is a by-product of the urease enzyme. Ammonia is very toxic to the cells of the stomach lining and can therefore cause inflammation. If enough of these bacteria colonize the stomach lining, a person can develop chronic inflammation, also known as chronic gastritis . Symptoms of chronic gastritis include upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. If the inflammation caused by H. Pylori is extreme enough, stomach acid and certain peptide digestive enzymes in the stomach may hinder the function of mechanisms that normally protect the stomach lining, causing ulcers to form. The symptoms of ulcers can be as extreme as a burning sensation in the stomach, fatty food intolerance, heartburn, and nausea . There are two common types of ulcers caused by H. Pylori, both of which can occur in the upper GI tract. First is a gastric ulcer which occurs only inside the stomach, as previously mentioned. However, the bacteria can also invade the upper portion of the duodenum, which is part of the small intestine and directly ventral to the stomach; the ulcers formed in this region are called duodenal ulcers. People with ulcers can be in excruciating pain, though there are different forms of treatment available for those suffering.\n\n(6). Treatments for ulcers usually begin with one week of \" triple therapy ” which, as the name suggests, consists of three different medications. The first medication is a proton pump inhibitor , which stops the secretion of acid, therefore relieving some of the initial pain. The next two parts of the \"triple therapy\" are a combination of antibiotics , such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin. Clarithromycin works on H. Pylori by binding and inhibiting a part of its ribosome, thus inhibiting its ability to make proteins. Amoxicillin , on the other hand, works through another mechanism; much like penicillin, it can inhibit the synthesis of the cell wall for H. Pylori. If this treatment fails, then another treatment shown to be effective involves the patient consuming another type of bacteria, this being a lactic acid bacterium that can suppress H. Pylori. However, the growing concern with the traditional methods of treatment is that the continuous use of antibiotics to fight H. Pylori is leading to the development of antibiotic-resistant H. Pylori. The more a given antibiotic is being administered to patients (such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin) the more bacteria can develop/transfer plasmids , which counteract antibiotics, thus leaving them ineffective. Hence, one of the key reasons to stop the initial infection of H . Pylori is so that treatment isn't necessary.\n\n(7). Current research is being done to find preventative measures to stop H. Pylori, therefore eradicating the need for treatments such as antibiotics. One of the major areas of research is looking at vaccinations. Researchers at the University of York in England looked at another aspect of preventative medicine by examining the Netherlands, and how vaccines for H. Pylori would have economic benefits, as the cost of a vaccine would be less than that of the constant treatments needed throughout the life of a patient. This shows that something as simple as a bacterium can influence many different aspects of the world, not just the health and safety of citizens. To come up with viable solutions to prevent and treat issues caused by H. Pylori, it is crucial to look at aspects such as the economic effects, social ramifications, and ethical issues when testing certain drugs and vaccines. A bacterium like Helicobacter Pylori , and the issues it causes to humans, show that antibiotic resistance is a serious issue; as such, to ultimately reduce the cases of gastritis and ulcers, researchers must look towards preventative treatments. Researchers from all fields must work together to come up with viable solutions that are medically effective, while also cost-effective and ethical in nature."

      "text": "(1). Frederick Grant Banting, a young Canadian orthopedic surgeon, was raised on a small Ontario farm. He initially enrolled at the University of Toronto’s Victoria College to study for the ministry, but in the fall of 1912 , he decided to transfer to U of T’s medical school, despite having no premedical preparation. Unfortunately, his medical studies were interrupted by World War I, and in 1915, Banting, along with other students, enlisted in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. However, they ultimately returned to the university to complete medical school at an accelerated pace, graduating in December of 1916 with medical degrees. Banting served as a medical officer in a Canadian hospital in England and was awarded the Military Cross by the British government for his valor and bravery during the Cambrai campaign. After returning to Toronto in March of 1919, he joined the staff at the Hospital for Sick Children and worked as a surgical resident. He then relocated to London, Ontario, where he opened a general surgical practice. During his time in London, he took up a part-time position in teaching anatomy and physiology at the University of Western Ontario (UWO), a local medical school.\n\n(2). When Banting commenced his role at the University of Western Ontario in 1920, he was still largely unknown in the medical community. Although Banting worked as a lecturer in the university’s Department of Physiology, he was less interested in teaching and was more keen to conduct research as well as continue hands-on medical practice. Since Banting preferred lab work to spending time in the classroom, his time at UWO was brief; by 1921, he elected to take a leave of absence from his position in order to continue his research in Toronto, a decision which would help to facilitate his part in the eventual discovery of insulin. Unsurprisingly, Banting's role in the discovery of insulin eclipsed his academic career in the history books, but his tenure at UWO nonetheless played a critical role in shaping his future, as the time he spent teaching broadened his knowledge of medicine and physiology.\n\n(3). On October 30, 1920, while preparing for a lecture on the pancreas , Banting came across an article by Moses Barron entitled, “The Relation of the Islets of Langerhans to Diabetes, With Special Reference to Cases of Pancreatic Lithiasis.” In a rare autopsy case, Barron observed that a pancreatic stone had formed and obstructed the main pancreatic duct, leading to the atrophy of all acinar cells, while most islet cells not only survived but also remained intact. Barron noted the similarities between the observations in this case and in experimental cases where pancreatic ducts were blocked by ligation.\n\n(4). Thus, such evidence strengthened the belief that the pancreatic islets were significant in explaining diabetes . The challenge encountered by those who attempted to study the role of the Islets of Langerhans in diabetes was in separating the extract of the islets from the rest of the pancreatic exocrine tissue . Banting hypothesized that during the extraction of the whole pancreatic gland the active principle implicated in glucose regulation was perhaps destroyed by digestive enzymes in the acinar tissue of the pancreas. This, he suspected, led to the failure of those that attempted to study the Islets of Langerhans before him. Later, Banting would indeed succeed in overcoming this challenge.\n\n(5). To appreciate why it was necessary to halt the exocrine capacity of the pancreatic gland to investigate glucose regulation, it is essential to recall the function and anatomy of the pancreas. The pancreas serves two functions: endocrine and exocrine. The pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans ) contain the hormone-producing endocrine cells, whereas the pancreatic acini ( acinar cells) serve an exocrine function i.e., producing digestive enzymes, which are released into the duodenum via pancreatic ducts. Duct ligation was thus necessary to cause the acini cells to atrophy, leaving behind only the cells from the islets of Langerhans, which could be further investigated.\n\n(6). In Banting’s notebook, which is preserved in the archives of the Academy of Medicine in Toronto, he wrote: “Diabetus. Ligate pancreatic ducts of dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate, leaving Islets. Try to isolate the internal secretion of these to relieve glycosuria.” By ligating the ducts and allowing the acinar cells to degenerate over time, Banting was hoping to isolate the internal secretion of the islet cells without the destructive action of pancreatic enzymes present in the external secretion of the acinar cells. It must be noted that Banting’s idea was not entirely new; several other investigators had attempted to prepare pancreatic extracts. The result of Banting’s tests was a temporary sugar-reducing effect adjoined by adverse side effects, such as fever and abscesses, primarily believed to be caused by impurities in the extract.\n\n(7). Shortly after arriving in London, Ontario, Banting decided to present his ideas to John J. R. Macleod in November of 1920 upon the advice of F. R. Miller , a neurophysiologist whom Banting had assisted with experiments during his tenure/time as a teacher at UWO medical school. Macleod, a physiology professor, and the head of the physiology department at U of T, had great insight into carbohydrate metabolism, and would also be able to provide Banting with a research facility and resources to test his proposal. According to Macleod’s own research, he too held the position that there was an internal secretion of the pancreas that might never be isolated in a pancreatic extract. However, as Banting explained his ideas to Macleod, he was met with skepticism . Macleod, well-versed in the literature, explained that many notable scientists had attempted to isolate this hormone but had failed. Nevertheless, Banting persisted, and after meeting with Macleod two more times, the latter, at last, agreed to arrange laboratory space for Banting to conduct his experiments. Charles H. Best was assigned by Macleod to help Banting test his hypothesis.\n\n(8). Banting and Best’s experimental work began in May of 1921, employing two sets of dogs. The pancreases were removed from the first set , making them diabetic; these dogs would later receive injections with the “isolated internal secretion of the islets cells” to test the success of their experimental techniques/procedures. In the other set of dogs , they ligated the pancreatic ducts to first halt the exocrine activity of the glands, and then harvest secretions from these to treat the diabetic set of dogs. After some initial setbacks, on July 30, Banting and Best noted improvements, albeit temporary, when they administered the sample to the experimentally induced diabetic dog. They repeated their experiments and documented frequent decreases in blood sugar levels in two more de-pancreatized dogs . They named this initial extract “ isletin ”.\n\n(9). Although the duct ligation procedure was of great scientific interest, it was not possible to repeat such procedures on a large scale to produce enough for clinical use. Thus, a better method needed to be discovered.\n\n(10). The duct ligation procedure could not be replicated on a larger scale for numerous reasons. The procedure was complex and time-consuming, involving intricate surgeries that would have been impractical and labor-intensive to perform on large numbers of dogs or other animals. The amount of insulin that could be extracted from a single animal was limited, making it difficult to produce enough for human use. Additionally, the yield of insulin was inconsistent, which made the method unreliable for large-scale production. Another drawback of the procedure was that it caused harm to the animals, meaning it raised significant ethical concerns. In the end, the necessity of performing challenging surgeries, and collecting enough secretions for large scale production, before extracting and purifying the hormones, made the procedure much too slow to feasibly deliver it to the public in large quantities. A better and more efficient system was needed if insulin was to be made readily available for all who required it.\n\n(11). In early December 1921, Banting and Best decided to use alcohol in the preparation of a fetal calf extract. The challenge faced with an aqueous saline extract was that, attempting to concentrate the extract by boiling off the water, this also seemed to destroy the much sought-after active principle. Alcohol solved this problem since it evaporates at a much lower temperature than water. Banting and Best were eager to test if they could get a similar result from a fresh adult pancreas; not only were they able to achieve this, but they noted a drop in blood sugar from 0.460% to 0.180% in 3 hours. Thus, there was no need for a degenerated pancreas or a fetal pancreas, as they had initially believed. Rather, a whole pancreas extract with alcohol seemed to be the secret combination.\n\n(12). Macleod, recognizing the breakthrough made by Banting and Best, decided to join in and included J. B. Collip in the team. Collip, an experienced biochemist, was assigned the task of purification. Collip’s purification work was monumental, and, in the winter of 1922, a young 14-year-old diabetic boy was treated with a purified extract made by Collip. The boy’s blood sugar decreased dramatically from 0.520% to 0.120% in the span of a day and his glucose excretion (in urine) dropped from 71.1 g to 8.7 g. The boy also looked brighter, felt better, and had become more active. This incident was noted as the first distinctly successful clinical test on a human diabetic patient who had been injected with the internal secretion of the pancreas. As more patients were treated at the Toronto General Hospital, similar favorable results emerged, and it began to make headlines, capturing the world’s attention. The discovery of insulin is arguably one of Canada’s biggest contributions to medical research, as it completely revolutionized the treatment of diabetes."

Therefore, we should search the passage for the paragraph or paragraphs that discuss postulations that were put forth regarding the pancreas. It can be presumed that such paragraphs will be found early in the passage since a hypothesis would precede any concrete discoveries. Indeed, paragraph 4 reads: “Banting hypothesized that during the extraction of the whole pancreatic gland the active principle implicated in glucose regulation was perhaps destroyed by digestive enzymes in the acinar tissue of the pancreas.” This tells us that Banting hypothesized that digestive enzymes were destroying the active principle implicated in glucose regulation. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",

      "text": "(1). Frederick Grant Banting, a young Canadian orthopedic surgeon, was raised on a small Ontario farm. He initially enrolled at the University of Toronto’s Victoria College to study for the ministry, but in the fall of 1912 , he decided to transfer to U of T’s medical school, despite having no premedical preparation. Unfortunately, his medical studies were interrupted by World War I, and in 1915, Banting, along with other students, enlisted in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. However, they ultimately returned to the university to complete medical school at an accelerated pace, graduating in December of 1916 with medical degrees. Banting served as a medical officer in a Canadian hospital in England and was awarded the Military Cross by the British government for his valor and bravery during the Cambrai campaign. After returning to Toronto in March of 1919, he joined the staff at the Hospital for Sick Children and worked as a surgical resident. He then relocated to London, Ontario, where he opened a general surgical practice. During his time in London, he took up a part-time position in teaching anatomy and physiology at the University of Western Ontario (UWO), a local medical school.\n\n(2). When Banting commenced his role at the University of Western Ontario in 1920, he was still largely unknown in the medical community. Although Banting worked as a lecturer in the university’s Department of Physiology, he was less interested in teaching and was more keen to conduct research as well as continue hands-on medical practice. Since Banting preferred lab work to spending time in the classroom, his time at UWO was brief; by 1921, he elected to take a leave of absence from his position in order to continue his research in Toronto, a decision which would help to facilitate his part in the eventual discovery of insulin. Unsurprisingly, Banting's role in the discovery of insulin eclipsed his academic career in the history books, but his tenure at UWO nonetheless played a critical role in shaping his future, as the time he spent teaching broadened his knowledge of medicine and physiology.\n\n(3). On October 30, 1920, while preparing for a lecture on the pancreas , Banting came across an article by Moses Barron entitled, “The Relation of the Islets of Langerhans to Diabetes, With Special Reference to Cases of Pancreatic Lithiasis.” In a rare autopsy case, Barron observed that a pancreatic stone had formed and obstructed the main pancreatic duct, leading to the atrophy of all acinar cells, while most islet cells not only survived but also remained intact. Barron noted the similarities between the observations in this case and in experimental cases where pancreatic ducts were blocked by ligation.\n\n(4). Thus, such evidence strengthened the belief that the pancreatic islets were significant in explaining diabetes . The challenge encountered by those who attempted to study the role of the Islets of Langerhans in diabetes was in separating the extract of the islets from the rest of the pancreatic exocrine tissue . Banting hypothesized that during the extraction of the whole pancreatic gland the active principle implicated in glucose regulation was perhaps destroyed by digestive enzymes in the acinar tissue of the pancreas. This, he suspected, led to the failure of those that attempted to study the Islets of Langerhans before him. Later, Banting would indeed succeed in overcoming this challenge.\n\n(5). To appreciate why it was necessary to halt the exocrine capacity of the pancreatic gland to investigate glucose regulation, it is essential to recall the function and anatomy of the pancreas. The pancreas serves two functions: endocrine and exocrine. The pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans ) contain the hormone-producing endocrine cells, whereas the pancreatic acini ( acinar cells) serve an exocrine function i.e., producing digestive enzymes, which are released into the duodenum via pancreatic ducts. Duct ligation was thus necessary to cause the acini cells to atrophy, leaving behind only the cells from the islets of Langerhans, which could be further investigated.\n\n(6). In Banting’s notebook, which is preserved in the archives of the Academy of Medicine in Toronto, he wrote: “Diabetus. Ligate pancreatic ducts of dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate, leaving Islets. Try to isolate the internal secretion of these to relieve glycosuria.” By ligating the ducts and allowing the acinar cells to degenerate over time, Banting was hoping to isolate the internal secretion of the islet cells without the destructive action of pancreatic enzymes present in the external secretion of the acinar cells. It must be noted that Banting’s idea was not entirely new; several other investigators had attempted to prepare pancreatic extracts. The result of Banting’s tests was a temporary sugar-reducing effect adjoined by adverse side effects, such as fever and abscesses, primarily believed to be caused by impurities in the extract.\n\n(7). Shortly after arriving in London, Ontario, Banting decided to present his ideas to John J. R. Macleod in November of 1920 upon the advice of F. R. Miller , a neurophysiologist whom Banting had assisted with experiments during his tenure/time as a teacher at UWO medical school. Macleod, a physiology professor, and the head of the physiology department at U of T, had great insight into carbohydrate metabolism, and would also be able to provide Banting with a research facility and resources to test his proposal. According to Macleod’s own research, he too held the position that there was an internal secretion of the pancreas that might never be isolated in a pancreatic extract. However, as Banting explained his ideas to Macleod, he was met with skepticism . Macleod, well-versed in the literature, explained that many notable scientists had attempted to isolate this hormone but had failed. Nevertheless, Banting persisted, and after meeting with Macleod two more times, the latter, at last, agreed to arrange laboratory space for Banting to conduct his experiments. Charles H. Best was assigned by Macleod to help Banting test his hypothesis.\n\n(8). Banting and Best’s experimental work began in May of 1921, employing two sets of dogs. The pancreases were removed from the first set , making them diabetic; these dogs would later receive injections with the “isolated internal secretion of the islets cells” to test the success of their experimental techniques/procedures. In the other set of dogs , they ligated the pancreatic ducts to first halt the exocrine activity of the glands, and then harvest secretions from these to treat the diabetic set of dogs. After some initial setbacks, on July 30, Banting and Best noted improvements, albeit temporary, when they administered the sample to the experimentally induced diabetic dog. They repeated their experiments and documented frequent decreases in blood sugar levels in two more de-pancreatized dogs . They named this initial extract “ isletin ”.\n\n(9). Although the duct ligation procedure was of great scientific interest, it was not possible to repeat such procedures on a large scale to produce enough for clinical use. Thus, a better method needed to be discovered.\n\n(10). The duct ligation procedure could not be replicated on a larger scale for numerous reasons. The procedure was complex and time-consuming, involving intricate surgeries that would have been impractical and labor-intensive to perform on large numbers of dogs or other animals. The amount of insulin that could be extracted from a single animal was limited, making it difficult to produce enough for human use. Additionally, the yield of insulin was inconsistent, which made the method unreliable for large-scale production. Another drawback of the procedure was that it caused harm to the animals, meaning it raised significant ethical concerns. In the end, the necessity of performing challenging surgeries, and collecting enough secretions for large scale production, before extracting and purifying the hormones, made the procedure much too slow to feasibly deliver it to the public in large quantities. A better and more efficient system was needed if insulin was to be made readily available for all who required it.\n\n(11). In early December 1921, Banting and Best decided to use alcohol in the preparation of a fetal calf extract. The challenge faced with an aqueous saline extract was that, attempting to concentrate the extract by boiling off the water, this also seemed to destroy the much sought-after active principle. Alcohol solved this problem since it evaporates at a much lower temperature than water. Banting and Best were eager to test if they could get a similar result from a fresh adult pancreas; not only were they able to achieve this, but they noted a drop in blood sugar from 0.460% to 0.180% in 3 hours. Thus, there was no need for a degenerated pancreas or a fetal pancreas, as they had initially believed. Rather, a whole pancreas extract with alcohol seemed to be the secret combination.\n\n(12). Macleod, recognizing the breakthrough made by Banting and Best, decided to join in and included J. B. Collip in the team. Collip, an experienced biochemist, was assigned the task of purification. Collip’s purification work was monumental, and, in the winter of 1922, a young 14-year-old diabetic boy was treated with a purified extract made by Collip. The boy’s blood sugar decreased dramatically from 0.520% to 0.120% in the span of a day and his glucose excretion (in urine) dropped from 71.1 g to 8.7 g. The boy also looked brighter, felt better, and had become more active. This incident was noted as the first distinctly successful clinical test on a human diabetic patient who had been injected with the internal secretion of the pancreas. As more patients were treated at the Toronto General Hospital, similar favorable results emerged, and it began to make headlines, capturing the world’s attention. The discovery of insulin is arguably one of Canada’s biggest contributions to medical research, as it completely revolutionized the treatment of diabetes."

Although Banting worked as a lecturer in the university’s Department of Physiology, he was less interested in teaching and was more keen to conduct research as well as continue hands-on medical practice. Since Banting preferred lab work to spending time in the classroom, his time at UWO was brief; by 1921, he elected to take a leave of absence from his position in order to continue his research in Toronto, a decision which would help to facilitate his part in the eventual discovery of insulin. Unsurprisingly, Banting's role in the discovery of insulin eclipsed his academic career in the history books, but his tenure at UWO nonetheless played a critical role in shaping his future, as the time he spent teaching broadened his knowledge of medicine and physiology.\n\n(3). On October 30, 1920, while preparing for a lecture on the pancreas , Banting came across an article by Moses Barron entitled, “The Relation of the Islets of Langerhans to Diabetes, With Special Reference to Cases of Pancreatic Lithiasis.” In a rare autopsy case, Barron observed that a pancreatic stone had formed and obstructed the main pancreatic duct, leading to the atrophy of all acinar cells, while most islet cells not only survived but also remained intact. Barron noted the similarities between the observations in this case and in experimental cases where pancreatic ducts were blocked by ligation.\n\n(4). Thus, such evidence strengthened the belief that the pancreatic islets were significant in explaining diabetes . The challenge encountered by those who attempted to study the role of the Islets of Langerhans in diabetes was in separating the extract of the islets from the rest of the pancreatic exocrine tissue . Banting hypothesized that during the extraction of the whole pancreatic gland the active principle implicated in glucose regulation was perhaps destroyed by digestive enzymes in the acinar tissue of the pancreas. This, he suspected, led to the failure of those that attempted to study the Islets of Langerhans before him. Later, Banting would indeed succeed in overcoming this challenge.\n\n(5). To appreciate why it was necessary to halt the exocrine capacity of the pancreatic gland to investigate glucose regulation, it is essential to recall the function and anatomy of the pancreas. The pancreas serves two functions: endocrine and exocrine. The pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans ) contain the hormone-producing endocrine cells, whereas the pancreatic acini ( acinar cells) serve an exocrine function i.e., producing digestive enzymes, which are released into the duodenum via pancreatic ducts. Duct ligation was thus necessary to cause the acini cells to atrophy, leaving behind only the cells from the islets of Langerhans, which could be further investigated.\n\n(6). In Banting’s notebook, which is preserved in the archives of the Academy of Medicine in Toronto, he wrote: “Diabetus. Ligate pancreatic ducts of dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate, leaving Islets. Try to isolate the internal secretion of these to relieve glycosuria.” By ligating the ducts and allowing the acinar cells to degenerate over time, Banting was hoping to isolate the internal secretion of the islet cells without the destructive action of pancreatic enzymes present in the external secretion of the acinar cells. It must be noted that Banting’s idea was not entirely new; several other investigators had attempted to prepare pancreatic extracts. The result of Banting’s tests was a temporary sugar-reducing effect adjoined by adverse side effects, such as fever and abscesses, primarily believed to be caused by impurities in the extract.\n\n(7). Shortly after arriving in London, Ontario, Banting decided to present his ideas to John J. R. Macleod in November of 1920 upon the advice of F. R. Miller , a neurophysiologist whom Banting had assisted with experiments during his tenure/time as a teacher at UWO medical school. Macleod, a physiology professor, and the head of the physiology department at U of T, had great insight into carbohydrate metabolism, and would also be able to provide Banting with a research facility and resources to test his proposal. According to Macleod’s own research, he too held the position that there was an internal secretion of the pancreas that might never be isolated in a pancreatic extract. However, as Banting explained his ideas to Macleod, he was met with skepticism . Macleod, well-versed in the literature, explained that many notable scientists had attempted to isolate this hormone but had failed. Nevertheless, Banting persisted, and after meeting with Macleod two more times, the latter, at last, agreed to arrange laboratory space for Banting to conduct his experiments. Charles H. Best was assigned by Macleod to help Banting test his hypothesis.\n\n(8). Banting and Best’s experimental work began in May of 1921, employing two sets of dogs. The pancreases were removed from the first set , making them diabetic; these dogs would later receive injections with the “isolated internal secretion of the islets cells” to test the success of their experimental techniques/procedures. In the other set of dogs , they ligated the pancreatic ducts to first halt the exocrine activity of the glands, and then harvest secretions from these to treat the diabetic set of dogs. After some initial setbacks, on July 30, Banting and Best noted improvements, albeit temporary, when they administered the sample to the experimentally induced diabetic dog. They repeated their experiments and documented frequent decreases in blood sugar levels in two more de-pancreatized dogs . They named this initial extract “ isletin ”.\n\n(9). Although the duct ligation procedure was of great scientific interest, it was not possible to repeat such procedures on a large scale to produce enough for clinical use. Thus, a better method needed to be discovered.\n\n(10). The duct ligation procedure could not be replicated on a larger scale for numerous reasons. The procedure was complex and time-consuming, involving intricate surgeries that would have been impractical and labor-intensive to perform on large numbers of dogs or other animals. The amount of insulin that could be extracted from a single animal was limited, making it difficult to produce enough for human use. Additionally, the yield of insulin was inconsistent, which made the method unreliable for large-scale production. Another drawback of the procedure was that it caused harm to the animals, meaning it raised significant ethical concerns. In the end, the necessity of performing challenging surgeries, and collecting enough secretions for large scale production, before extracting and purifying the hormones, made the procedure much too slow to feasibly deliver it to the public in large quantities. A better and more efficient system was needed if insulin was to be made readily available for all who required it.\n\n(11). In early December 1921, Banting and Best decided to use alcohol in the preparation of a fetal calf extract. The challenge faced with an aqueous saline extract was that, attempting to concentrate the extract by boiling off the water, this also seemed to destroy the much sought-after active principle. Alcohol solved this problem since it evaporates at a much lower temperature than water. Banting and Best were eager to test if they could get a similar result from a fresh adult pancreas; not only were they able to achieve this, but they noted a drop in blood sugar from 0.460% to 0.180% in 3 hours. Thus, there was no need for a degenerated pancreas or a fetal pancreas, as they had initially believed. Rather, a whole pancreas extract with alcohol seemed to be the secret combination.\n\n(12). Macleod, recognizing the breakthrough made by Banting and Best, decided to join in and included J. B. Collip in the team. Collip, an experienced biochemist, was assigned the task of purification. Collip’s purification work was monumental, and, in the winter of 1922, a young 14-year-old diabetic boy was treated with a purified extract made by Collip. The boy’s blood sugar decreased dramatically from 0.520% to 0.120% in the span of a day and his glucose excretion (in urine) dropped from 71.1 g to 8.7 g. The boy also looked brighter, felt better, and had become more active. This incident was noted as the first distinctly successful clinical test on a human diabetic patient who had been injected with the internal secretion of the pancreas. As more patients were treated at the Toronto General Hospital, similar favorable results emerged, and it began to make headlines, capturing the world’s attention. The discovery of insulin is arguably one of Canada’s biggest contributions to medical research, as it completely revolutionized the treatment of diabetes."

      "text": "(1). Frederick Grant Banting, a young Canadian orthopedic surgeon, was raised on a small Ontario farm. He initially enrolled at the University of Toronto’s Victoria College to study for the ministry, but in the fall of 1912 , he decided to transfer to U of T’s medical school, despite having no premedical preparation. Unfortunately, his medical studies were interrupted by World War I, and in 1915, Banting, along with other students, enlisted in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. However, they ultimately returned to the university to complete medical school at an accelerated pace, graduating in December of 1916 with medical degrees. Banting served as a medical officer in a Canadian hospital in England and was awarded the Military Cross by the British government for his valor and bravery during the Cambrai campaign. After returning to Toronto in March of 1919, he joined the staff at the Hospital for Sick Children and worked as a surgical resident.

They repeated their experiments and documented frequent decreases in blood sugar levels in two more de-pancreatized dogs . They named this initial extract “ isletin ”.\n\n(9). Although the duct ligation procedure was of great scientific interest, it was not possible to repeat such procedures on a large scale to produce enough for clinical use. Thus, a better method needed to be discovered.\n\n(10). The duct ligation procedure could not be replicated on a larger scale for numerous reasons. The procedure was complex and time-consuming, involving intricate surgeries that would have been impractical and labor-intensive to perform on large numbers of dogs or other animals. The amount of insulin that could be extracted from a single animal was limited, making it difficult to produce enough for human use. Additionally, the yield of insulin was inconsistent, which made the method unreliable for large-scale production. Another drawback of the procedure was that it caused harm to the animals, meaning it raised significant ethical concerns. In the end, the necessity of performing challenging surgeries, and collecting enough secretions for large scale production, before extracting and purifying the hormones, made the procedure much too slow to feasibly deliver it to the public in large quantities. A better and more efficient system was needed if insulin was to be made readily available for all who required it.\n\n(11). In early December 1921, Banting and Best decided to use alcohol in the preparation of a fetal calf extract. The challenge faced with an aqueous saline extract was that, attempting to concentrate the extract by boiling off the water, this also seemed to destroy the much sought-after active principle. Alcohol solved this problem since it evaporates at a much lower temperature than water. Banting and Best were eager to test if they could get a similar result from a fresh adult pancreas; not only were they able to achieve this, but they noted a drop in blood sugar from 0.460% to 0.180% in 3 hours. Thus, there was no need for a degenerated pancreas or a fetal pancreas, as they had initially believed. Rather, a whole pancreas extract with alcohol seemed to be the secret combination.\n\n(12). Macleod, recognizing the breakthrough made by Banting and Best, decided to join in and included J. B. Collip in the team. Collip, an experienced biochemist, was assigned the task of purification. Collip’s purification work was monumental, and, in the winter of 1922, a young 14-year-old diabetic boy was treated with a purified extract made by Collip. The boy’s blood sugar decreased dramatically from 0.520% to 0.120% in the span of a day and his glucose excretion (in urine) dropped from 71.1 g to 8.7 g. The boy also looked brighter, felt better, and had become more active. This incident was noted as the first distinctly successful clinical test on a human diabetic patient who had been injected with the internal secretion of the pancreas. As more patients were treated at the Toronto General Hospital, similar favorable results emerged, and it began to make headlines, capturing the world’s attention. The discovery of insulin is arguably one of Canada’s biggest contributions to medical research, as it completely revolutionized the treatment of diabetes."

      "text": "(1). Frederick Grant Banting, a young Canadian orthopedic surgeon, was raised on a small Ontario farm. He initially enrolled at the University of Toronto’s Victoria College to study for the ministry, but in the fall of 1912 , he decided to transfer to U of T’s medical school, despite having no premedical preparation. Unfortunately, his medical studies were interrupted by World War I, and in 1915, Banting, along with other students, enlisted in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. However, they ultimately returned to the university to complete medical school at an accelerated pace, graduating in December of 1916 with medical degrees. Banting served as a medical officer in a Canadian hospital in England and was awarded the Military Cross by the British government for his valor and bravery during the Cambrai campaign. After returning to Toronto in March of 1919, he joined the staff at the Hospital for Sick Children and worked as a surgical resident. He then relocated to London, Ontario, where he opened a general surgical practice. During his time in London, he took up a part-time position in teaching anatomy and physiology at the University of Western Ontario (UWO), a local medical school.\n\n(2). When Banting commenced his role at the University of Western Ontario in 1920, he was still largely unknown in the medical community. Although Banting worked as a lecturer in the university’s Department of Physiology, he was less interested in teaching and was more keen to conduct research as well as continue hands-on medical practice. Since Banting preferred lab work to spending time in the classroom, his time at UWO was brief; by 1921, he elected to take a leave of absence from his position in order to continue his research in Toronto, a decision which would help to facilitate his part in the eventual discovery of insulin. Unsurprisingly, Banting's role in the discovery of insulin eclipsed his academic career in the history books, but his tenure at UWO nonetheless played a critical role in shaping his future, as the time he spent teaching broadened his knowledge of medicine and physiology.\n\n(3). On October 30, 1920, while preparing for a lecture on the pancreas , Banting came across an article by Moses Barron entitled, “The Relation of the Islets of Langerhans to Diabetes, With Special Reference to Cases of Pancreatic Lithiasis.” In a rare autopsy case, Barron observed that a pancreatic stone had formed and obstructed the main pancreatic duct, leading to the atrophy of all acinar cells, while most islet cells not only survived but also remained intact. Barron noted the similarities between the observations in this case and in experimental cases where pancreatic ducts were blocked by ligation.\n\n(4). Thus, such evidence strengthened the belief that the pancreatic islets were significant in explaining diabetes . The challenge encountered by those who attempted to study the role of the Islets of Langerhans in diabetes was in separating the extract of the islets from the rest of the pancreatic exocrine tissue . Banting hypothesized that during the extraction of the whole pancreatic gland the active principle implicated in glucose regulation was perhaps destroyed by digestive enzymes in the acinar tissue of the pancreas. This, he suspected, led to the failure of those that attempted to study the Islets of Langerhans before him. Later, Banting would indeed succeed in overcoming this challenge.\n\n(5). To appreciate why it was necessary to halt the exocrine capacity of the pancreatic gland to investigate glucose regulation, it is essential to recall the function and anatomy of the pancreas. The pancreas serves two functions: endocrine and exocrine. The pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans ) contain the hormone-producing endocrine cells, whereas the pancreatic acini ( acinar cells) serve an exocrine function i.e., producing digestive enzymes, which are released into the duodenum via pancreatic ducts. Duct ligation was thus necessary to cause the acini cells to atrophy, leaving behind only the cells from the islets of Langerhans, which could be further investigated.\n\n(6). In Banting’s notebook, which is preserved in the archives of the Academy of Medicine in Toronto, he wrote: “Diabetus. Ligate pancreatic ducts of dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate, leaving Islets. Try to isolate the internal secretion of these to relieve glycosuria.” By ligating the ducts and allowing the acinar cells to degenerate over time, Banting was hoping to isolate the internal secretion of the islet cells without the destructive action of pancreatic enzymes present in the external secretion of the acinar cells. It must be noted that Banting’s idea was not entirely new; several other investigators had attempted to prepare pancreatic extracts. The result of Banting’s tests was a temporary sugar-reducing effect adjoined by adverse side effects, such as fever and abscesses, primarily believed to be caused by impurities in the extract.\n\n(7). Shortly after arriving in London, Ontario, Banting decided to present his ideas to John J. R. Macleod in November of 1920 upon the advice of F. R. Miller , a neurophysiologist whom Banting had assisted with experiments during his tenure/time as a teacher at UWO medical school. Macleod, a physiology professor, and the head of the physiology department at U of T, had great insight into carbohydrate metabolism, and would also be able to provide Banting with a research facility and resources to test his proposal. According to Macleod’s own research, he too held the position that there was an internal secretion of the pancreas that might never be isolated in a pancreatic extract. However, as Banting explained his ideas to Macleod, he was met with skepticism . Macleod, well-versed in the literature, explained that many notable scientists had attempted to isolate this hormone but had failed. Nevertheless, Banting persisted, and after meeting with Macleod two more times, the latter, at last, agreed to arrange laboratory space for Banting to conduct his experiments. Charles H. Best was assigned by Macleod to help Banting test his hypothesis.\n\n(8). Banting and Best’s experimental work began in May of 1921, employing two sets of dogs. The pancreases were removed from the first set , making them diabetic; these dogs would later receive injections with the “isolated internal secretion of the islets cells” to test the success of their experimental techniques/procedures. In the other set of dogs , they ligated the pancreatic ducts to first halt the exocrine activity of the glands, and then harvest secretions from these to treat the diabetic set of dogs. After some initial setbacks, on July 30, Banting and Best noted improvements, albeit temporary, when they administered the sample to the experimentally induced diabetic dog. They repeated their experiments and documented frequent decreases in blood sugar levels in two more de-pancreatized dogs . They named this initial extract “ isletin ”.\n\n(9).

As the work of these individuals would have preceded Banting’s and Best’s discoveries historically, we can presume the section of the text referencing such individuals will be found early in the passage. Indeed, paragraph 4 reads: “The challenge encountered by those who attempted to study the role of the Islets of Langerhans in diabetes was in separating the extract of the islets from the rest of the pancreatic exocrine tissue.” This tells us that the challenge for these individuals was in separating the extract of the islets from the rest of the pancreatic exocrine tissue.

Option B. Separating the extract of the islets from the rest of the pancreatic endocrine tissue – is incorrect because in paragraph 4, the author says, “separating the extract of the islets from the rest of the pancreatic exocrine tissue,” not endocrine tissue.

      "text": "(1). Frederick Grant Banting, a young Canadian orthopedic surgeon, was raised on a small Ontario farm. He initially enrolled at the University of Toronto’s Victoria College to study for the ministry, but in the fall of 1912 , he decided to transfer to U of T’s medical school, despite having no premedical preparation. Unfortunately, his medical studies were interrupted by World War I, and in 1915, Banting, along with other students, enlisted in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. However, they ultimately returned to the university to complete medical school at an accelerated pace, graduating in December of 1916 with medical degrees. Banting served as a medical officer in a Canadian hospital in England and was awarded the Military Cross by the British government for his valor and bravery during the Cambrai campaign. After returning to Toronto in March of 1919, he joined the staff at the Hospital for Sick Children and worked as a surgical resident. He then relocated to London, Ontario, where he opened a general surgical practice. During his time in London, he took up a part-time position in teaching anatomy and physiology at the University of Western Ontario (UWO), a local medical school.\n\n(2). When Banting commenced his role at the University of Western Ontario in 1920, he was still largely unknown in the medical community. Although Banting worked as a lecturer in the university’s Department of Physiology, he was less interested in teaching and was more keen to conduct research as well as continue hands-on medical practice. Since Banting preferred lab work to spending time in the classroom, his time at UWO was brief; by 1921, he elected to take a leave of absence from his position in order to continue his research in Toronto, a decision which would help to facilitate his part in the eventual discovery of insulin. Unsurprisingly, Banting's role in the discovery of insulin eclipsed his academic career in the history books, but his tenure at UWO nonetheless played a critical role in shaping his future, as the time he spent teaching broadened his knowledge of medicine and physiology.\n\n(3). On October 30, 1920, while preparing for a lecture on the pancreas , Banting came across an article by Moses Barron entitled, “The Relation of the Islets of Langerhans to Diabetes, With Special Reference to Cases of Pancreatic Lithiasis.” In a rare autopsy case, Barron observed that a pancreatic stone had formed and obstructed the main pancreatic duct, leading to the atrophy of all acinar cells, while most islet cells not only survived but also remained intact. Barron noted the similarities between the observations in this case and in experimental cases where pancreatic ducts were blocked by ligation.\n\n(4). Thus, such evidence strengthened the belief that the pancreatic islets were significant in explaining diabetes . The challenge encountered by those who attempted to study the role of the Islets of Langerhans in diabetes was in separating the extract of the islets from the rest of the pancreatic exocrine tissue . Banting hypothesized that during the extraction of the whole pancreatic gland the active principle implicated in glucose regulation was perhaps destroyed by digestive enzymes in the acinar tissue of the pancreas. This, he suspected, led to the failure of those that attempted to study the Islets of Langerhans before him. Later, Banting would indeed succeed in overcoming this challenge.\n\n(5). To appreciate why it was necessary to halt the exocrine capacity of the pancreatic gland to investigate glucose regulation, it is essential to recall the function and anatomy of the pancreas. The pancreas serves two functions: endocrine and exocrine. The pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans ) contain the hormone-producing endocrine cells, whereas the pancreatic acini ( acinar cells) serve an exocrine function i.e., producing digestive enzymes, which are released into the duodenum via pancreatic ducts. Duct ligation was thus necessary to cause the acini cells to atrophy, leaving behind only the cells from the islets of Langerhans, which could be further investigated.\n\n(6). In Banting’s notebook, which is preserved in the archives of the Academy of Medicine in Toronto, he wrote: “Diabetus. Ligate pancreatic ducts of dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate, leaving Islets. Try to isolate the internal secretion of these to relieve glycosuria.” By ligating the ducts and allowing the acinar cells to degenerate over time, Banting was hoping to isolate the internal secretion of the islet cells without the destructive action of pancreatic enzymes present in the external secretion of the acinar cells. It must be noted that Banting’s idea was not entirely new; several other investigators had attempted to prepare pancreatic extracts. The result of Banting’s tests was a temporary sugar-reducing effect adjoined by adverse side effects, such as fever and abscesses, primarily believed to be caused by impurities in the extract.\n\n(7). Shortly after arriving in London, Ontario, Banting decided to present his ideas to John J. R. Macleod in November of 1920 upon the advice of F. R. Miller , a neurophysiologist whom Banting had assisted with experiments during his tenure/time as a teacher at UWO medical school. Macleod, a physiology professor, and the head of the physiology department at U of T, had great insight into carbohydrate metabolism, and would also be able to provide Banting with a research facility and resources to test his proposal. According to Macleod’s own research, he too held the position that there was an internal secretion of the pancreas that might never be isolated in a pancreatic extract. However, as Banting explained his ideas to Macleod, he was met with skepticism . Macleod, well-versed in the literature, explained that many notable scientists had attempted to isolate this hormone but had failed. Nevertheless, Banting persisted, and after meeting with Macleod two more times, the latter, at last, agreed to arrange laboratory space for Banting to conduct his experiments. Charles H. Best was assigned by Macleod to help Banting test his hypothesis.\n\n(8). Banting and Best’s experimental work began in May of 1921, employing two sets of dogs. The pancreases were removed from the first set , making them diabetic; these dogs would later receive injections with the “isolated internal secretion of the islets cells” to test the success of their experimental techniques/procedures. In the other set of dogs , they ligated the pancreatic ducts to first halt the exocrine activity of the glands, and then harvest secretions from these to treat the diabetic set of dogs. After some initial setbacks, on July 30, Banting and Best noted improvements, albeit temporary, when they administered the sample to the experimentally induced diabetic dog. They repeated their experiments and documented frequent decreases in blood sugar levels in two more de-pancreatized dogs . They named this initial extract “ isletin ”.\n\n(9). Although the duct ligation procedure was of great scientific interest, it was not possible to repeat such procedures on a large scale to produce enough for clinical use. Thus, a better method needed to be discovered.\n\n(10). The duct ligation procedure could not be replicated on a larger scale for numerous reasons. The procedure was complex and time-consuming, involving intricate surgeries that would have been impractical and labor-intensive to perform on large numbers of dogs or other animals. The amount of insulin that could be extracted from a single animal was limited, making it difficult to produce enough for human use. Additionally, the yield of insulin was inconsistent, which made the method unreliable for large-scale production. Another drawback of the procedure was that it caused harm to the animals, meaning it raised significant ethical concerns. In the end, the necessity of performing challenging surgeries, and collecting enough secretions for large scale production, before extracting and purifying the hormones, made the procedure much too slow to feasibly deliver it to the public in large quantities. A better and more efficient system was needed if insulin was to be made readily available for all who required it.\n\n(11). In early December 1921, Banting and Best decided to use alcohol in the preparation of a fetal calf extract. The challenge faced with an aqueous saline extract was that, attempting to concentrate the extract by boiling off the water, this also seemed to destroy the much sought-after active principle. Alcohol solved this problem since it evaporates at a much lower temperature than water. Banting and Best were eager to test if they could get a similar result from a fresh adult pancreas; not only were they able to achieve this, but they noted a drop in blood sugar from 0.460% to 0.180% in 3 hours. Thus, there was no need for a degenerated pancreas or a fetal pancreas, as they had initially believed. Rather, a whole pancreas extract with alcohol seemed to be the secret combination.\n\n(12). Macleod, recognizing the breakthrough made by Banting and Best, decided to join in and included J. B. Collip in the team. Collip, an experienced biochemist, was assigned the task of purification. Collip’s purification work was monumental, and, in the winter of 1922, a young 14-year-old diabetic boy was treated with a purified extract made by Collip. The boy’s blood sugar decreased dramatically from 0.520% to 0.120% in the span of a day and his glucose excretion (in urine) dropped from 71.1 g to 8.7 g. The boy also looked brighter, felt better, and had become more active. This incident was noted as the first distinctly successful clinical test on a human diabetic patient who had been injected with the internal secretion of the pancreas. As more patients were treated at the Toronto General Hospital, similar favorable results emerged, and it began to make headlines, capturing the world’s attention. The discovery of insulin is arguably one of Canada’s biggest contributions to medical research, as it completely revolutionized the treatment of diabetes."

The result of Banting’s tests was a temporary sugar-reducing effect adjoined by adverse side effects, such as fever and abscesses, primarily believed to be caused by impurities in the extract.\n\n(7). Shortly after arriving in London, Ontario, Banting decided to present his ideas to John J. R. Macleod in November of 1920 upon the advice of F. R. Miller , a neurophysiologist whom Banting had assisted with experiments during his tenure/time as a teacher at UWO medical school. Macleod, a physiology professor, and the head of the physiology department at U of T, had great insight into carbohydrate metabolism, and would also be able to provide Banting with a research facility and resources to test his proposal. According to Macleod’s own research, he too held the position that there was an internal secretion of the pancreas that might never be isolated in a pancreatic extract. However, as Banting explained his ideas to Macleod, he was met with skepticism . Macleod, well-versed in the literature, explained that many notable scientists had attempted to isolate this hormone but had failed. Nevertheless, Banting persisted, and after meeting with Macleod two more times, the latter, at last, agreed to arrange laboratory space for Banting to conduct his experiments. Charles H. Best was assigned by Macleod to help Banting test his hypothesis.\n\n(8). Banting and Best’s experimental work began in May of 1921, employing two sets of dogs. The pancreases were removed from the first set , making them diabetic; these dogs would later receive injections with the “isolated internal secretion of the islets cells” to test the success of their experimental techniques/procedures. In the other set of dogs , they ligated the pancreatic ducts to first halt the exocrine activity of the glands, and then harvest secretions from these to treat the diabetic set of dogs. After some initial setbacks, on July 30, Banting and Best noted improvements, albeit temporary, when they administered the sample to the experimentally induced diabetic dog. They repeated their experiments and documented frequent decreases in blood sugar levels in two more de-pancreatized dogs . They named this initial extract “ isletin ”.\n\n(9). Although the duct ligation procedure was of great scientific interest, it was not possible to repeat such procedures on a large scale to produce enough for clinical use. Thus, a better method needed to be discovered.\n\n(10). The duct ligation procedure could not be replicated on a larger scale for numerous reasons. The procedure was complex and time-consuming, involving intricate surgeries that would have been impractical and labor-intensive to perform on large numbers of dogs or other animals. The amount of insulin that could be extracted from a single animal was limited, making it difficult to produce enough for human use. Additionally, the yield of insulin was inconsistent, which made the method unreliable for large-scale production. Another drawback of the procedure was that it caused harm to the animals, meaning it raised significant ethical concerns. In the end, the necessity of performing challenging surgeries, and collecting enough secretions for large scale production, before extracting and purifying the hormones, made the procedure much too slow to feasibly deliver it to the public in large quantities. A better and more efficient system was needed if insulin was to be made readily available for all who required it.\n\n(11). In early December 1921, Banting and Best decided to use alcohol in the preparation of a fetal calf extract. The challenge faced with an aqueous saline extract was that, attempting to concentrate the extract by boiling off the water, this also seemed to destroy the much sought-after active principle. Alcohol solved this problem since it evaporates at a much lower temperature than water. Banting and Best were eager to test if they could get a similar result from a fresh adult pancreas; not only were they able to achieve this, but they noted a drop in blood sugar from 0.460% to 0.180% in 3 hours. Thus, there was no need for a degenerated pancreas or a fetal pancreas, as they had initially believed. Rather, a whole pancreas extract with alcohol seemed to be the secret combination.\n\n(12). Macleod, recognizing the breakthrough made by Banting and Best, decided to join in and included J. B. Collip in the team. Collip, an experienced biochemist, was assigned the task of purification. Collip’s purification work was monumental, and, in the winter of 1922, a young 14-year-old diabetic boy was treated with a purified extract made by Collip. The boy’s blood sugar decreased dramatically from 0.520% to 0.120% in the span of a day and his glucose excretion (in urine) dropped from 71.1 g to 8.7 g. The boy also looked brighter, felt better, and had become more active. This incident was noted as the first distinctly successful clinical test on a human diabetic patient who had been injected with the internal secretion of the pancreas. As more patients were treated at the Toronto General Hospital, similar favorable results emerged, and it began to make headlines, capturing the world’s attention. The discovery of insulin is arguably one of Canada’s biggest contributions to medical research, as it completely revolutionized the treatment of diabetes."

      "text": "(1). Frederick Grant Banting, a young Canadian orthopedic surgeon, was raised on a small Ontario farm. He initially enrolled at the University of Toronto’s Victoria College to study for the ministry, but in the fall of 1912 , he decided to transfer to U of T’s medical school, despite having no premedical preparation. Unfortunately, his medical studies were interrupted by World War I, and in 1915, Banting, along with other students, enlisted in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. However, they ultimately returned to the university to complete medical school at an accelerated pace, graduating in December of 1916 with medical degrees. Banting served as a medical officer in a Canadian hospital in England and was awarded the Military Cross by the British government for his valor and bravery during the Cambrai campaign. After returning to Toronto in March of 1919, he joined the staff at the Hospital for Sick Children and worked as a surgical resident. He then relocated to London, Ontario, where he opened a general surgical practice. During his time in London, he took up a part-time position in teaching anatomy and physiology at the University of Western Ontario (UWO), a local medical school.\n\n(2). When Banting commenced his role at the University of Western Ontario in 1920, he was still largely unknown in the medical community. Although Banting worked as a lecturer in the university’s Department of Physiology, he was less interested in teaching and was more keen to conduct research as well as continue hands-on medical practice. Since Banting preferred lab work to spending time in the classroom, his time at UWO was brief; by 1921, he elected to take a leave of absence from his position in order to continue his research in Toronto, a decision which would help to facilitate his part in the eventual discovery of insulin. Unsurprisingly, Banting's role in the discovery of insulin eclipsed his academic career in the history books, but his tenure at UWO nonetheless played a critical role in shaping his future, as the time he spent teaching broadened his knowledge of medicine and physiology.\n\n(3). On October 30, 1920, while preparing for a lecture on the pancreas , Banting came across an article by Moses Barron entitled, “The Relation of the Islets of Langerhans to Diabetes, With Special Reference to Cases of Pancreatic Lithiasis.” In a rare autopsy case, Barron observed that a pancreatic stone had formed and obstructed the main pancreatic duct, leading to the atrophy of all acinar cells, while most islet cells not only survived but also remained intact. Barron noted the similarities between the observations in this case and in experimental cases where pancreatic ducts were blocked by ligation.\n\n(4). Thus, such evidence strengthened the belief that the pancreatic islets were significant in explaining diabetes . The challenge encountered by those who attempted to study the role of the Islets of Langerhans in diabetes was in separating the extract of the islets from the rest of the pancreatic exocrine tissue . Banting hypothesized that during the extraction of the whole pancreatic gland the active principle implicated in glucose regulation was perhaps destroyed by digestive enzymes in the acinar tissue of the pancreas. This, he suspected, led to the failure of those that attempted to study the Islets of Langerhans before him. Later, Banting would indeed succeed in overcoming this challenge.\n\n(5). To appreciate why it was necessary to halt the exocrine capacity of the pancreatic gland to investigate glucose regulation, it is essential to recall the function and anatomy of the pancreas. The pancreas serves two functions: endocrine and exocrine. The pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans ) contain the hormone-producing endocrine cells, whereas the pancreatic acini ( acinar cells) serve an exocrine function i.e., producing digestive enzymes, which are released into the duodenum via pancreatic ducts. Duct ligation was thus necessary to cause the acini cells to atrophy, leaving behind only the cells from the islets of Langerhans, which could be further investigated.\n\n(6). In Banting’s notebook, which is preserved in the archives of the Academy of Medicine in Toronto, he wrote: “Diabetus. Ligate pancreatic ducts of dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate, leaving Islets. Try to isolate the internal secretion of these to relieve glycosuria.” By ligating the ducts and allowing the acinar cells to degenerate over time, Banting was hoping to isolate the internal secretion of the islet cells without the destructive action of pancreatic enzymes present in the external secretion of the acinar cells. It must be noted that Banting’s idea was not entirely new; several other investigators had attempted to prepare pancreatic extracts.

      "text": "(1). Frederick Grant Banting, a young Canadian orthopedic surgeon, was raised on a small Ontario farm. He initially enrolled at the University of Toronto’s Victoria College to study for the ministry, but in the fall of 1912 , he decided to transfer to U of T’s medical school, despite having no premedical preparation. Unfortunately, his medical studies were interrupted by World War I, and in 1915, Banting, along with other students, enlisted in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. However, they ultimately returned to the university to complete medical school at an accelerated pace, graduating in December of 1916 with medical degrees. Banting served as a medical officer in a Canadian hospital in England and was awarded the Military Cross by the British government for his valor and bravery during the Cambrai campaign. After returning to Toronto in March of 1919, he joined the staff at the Hospital for Sick Children and worked as a surgical resident. He then relocated to London, Ontario, where he opened a general surgical practice. During his time in London, he took up a part-time position in teaching anatomy and physiology at the University of Western Ontario (UWO), a local medical school.\n\n(2). When Banting commenced his role at the University of Western Ontario in 1920, he was still largely unknown in the medical community. Although Banting worked as a lecturer in the university’s Department of Physiology, he was less interested in teaching and was more keen to conduct research as well as continue hands-on medical practice. Since Banting preferred lab work to spending time in the classroom, his time at UWO was brief; by 1921, he elected to take a leave of absence from his position in order to continue his research in Toronto, a decision which would help to facilitate his part in the eventual discovery of insulin. Unsurprisingly, Banting's role in the discovery of insulin eclipsed his academic career in the history books, but his tenure at UWO nonetheless played a critical role in shaping his future, as the time he spent teaching broadened his knowledge of medicine and physiology.\n\n(3). On October 30, 1920, while preparing for a lecture on the pancreas , Banting came across an article by Moses Barron entitled, “The Relation of the Islets of Langerhans to Diabetes, With Special Reference to Cases of Pancreatic Lithiasis.” In a rare autopsy case, Barron observed that a pancreatic stone had formed and obstructed the main pancreatic duct, leading to the atrophy of all acinar cells, while most islet cells not only survived but also remained intact. Barron noted the similarities between the observations in this case and in experimental cases where pancreatic ducts were blocked by ligation.\n\n(4). Thus, such evidence strengthened the belief that the pancreatic islets were significant in explaining diabetes . The challenge encountered by those who attempted to study the role of the Islets of Langerhans in diabetes was in separating the extract of the islets from the rest of the pancreatic exocrine tissue . Banting hypothesized that during the extraction of the whole pancreatic gland the active principle implicated in glucose regulation was perhaps destroyed by digestive enzymes in the acinar tissue of the pancreas. This, he suspected, led to the failure of those that attempted to study the Islets of Langerhans before him. Later, Banting would indeed succeed in overcoming this challenge.\n\n(5). To appreciate why it was necessary to halt the exocrine capacity of the pancreatic gland to investigate glucose regulation, it is essential to recall the function and anatomy of the pancreas. The pancreas serves two functions: endocrine and exocrine. The pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans ) contain the hormone-producing endocrine cells, whereas the pancreatic acini ( acinar cells) serve an exocrine function i.e., producing digestive enzymes, which are released into the duodenum via pancreatic ducts. Duct ligation was thus necessary to cause the acini cells to atrophy, leaving behind only the cells from the islets of Langerhans, which could be further investigated.\n\n(6). In Banting’s notebook, which is preserved in the archives of the Academy of Medicine in Toronto, he wrote: “Diabetus. Ligate pancreatic ducts of dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate, leaving Islets. Try to isolate the internal secretion of these to relieve glycosuria.” By ligating the ducts and allowing the acinar cells to degenerate over time, Banting was hoping to isolate the internal secretion of the islet cells without the destructive action of pancreatic enzymes present in the external secretion of the acinar cells. It must be noted that Banting’s idea was not entirely new; several other investigators had attempted to prepare pancreatic extracts. The result of Banting’s tests was a temporary sugar-reducing effect adjoined by adverse side effects, such as fever and abscesses, primarily believed to be caused by impurities in the extract.\n\n(7). Shortly after arriving in London, Ontario, Banting decided to present his ideas to John J. R. Macleod in November of 1920 upon the advice of F. R. Miller , a neurophysiologist whom Banting had assisted with experiments during his tenure/time as a teacher at UWO medical school. Macleod, a physiology professor, and the head of the physiology department at U of T, had great insight into carbohydrate metabolism, and would also be able to provide Banting with a research facility and resources to test his proposal. According to Macleod’s own research, he too held the position that there was an internal secretion of the pancreas that might never be isolated in a pancreatic extract. However, as Banting explained his ideas to Macleod, he was met with skepticism . Macleod, well-versed in the literature, explained that many notable scientists had attempted to isolate this hormone but had failed. Nevertheless, Banting persisted, and after meeting with Macleod two more times, the latter, at last, agreed to arrange laboratory space for Banting to conduct his experiments. Charles H. Best was assigned by Macleod to help Banting test his hypothesis.\n\n(8). Banting and Best’s experimental work began in May of 1921, employing two sets of dogs. The pancreases were removed from the first set , making them diabetic; these dogs would later receive injections with the “isolated internal secretion of the islets cells” to test the success of their experimental techniques/procedures. In the other set of dogs , they ligated the pancreatic ducts to first halt the exocrine activity of the glands, and then harvest secretions from these to treat the diabetic set of dogs. After some initial setbacks, on July 30, Banting and Best noted improvements, albeit temporary, when they administered the sample to the experimentally induced diabetic dog. They repeated their experiments and documented frequent decreases in blood sugar levels in two more de-pancreatized dogs . They named this initial extract “ isletin ”.\n\n(9). Although the duct ligation procedure was of great scientific interest, it was not possible to repeat such procedures on a large scale to produce enough for clinical use. Thus, a better method needed to be discovered.\n\n(10). The duct ligation procedure could not be replicated on a larger scale for numerous reasons. The procedure was complex and time-consuming, involving intricate surgeries that would have been impractical and labor-intensive to perform on large numbers of dogs or other animals. The amount of insulin that could be extracted from a single animal was limited, making it difficult to produce enough for human use. Additionally, the yield of insulin was inconsistent, which made the method unreliable for large-scale production. Another drawback of the procedure was that it caused harm to the animals, meaning it raised significant ethical concerns. In the end, the necessity of performing challenging surgeries, and collecting enough secretions for large scale production, before extracting and purifying the hormones, made the procedure much too slow to feasibly deliver it to the public in large quantities. A better and more efficient system was needed if insulin was to be made readily available for all who required it.\n\n(11). In early December 1921, Banting and Best decided to use alcohol in the preparation of a fetal calf extract. The challenge faced with an aqueous saline extract was that, attempting to concentrate the extract by boiling off the water, this also seemed to destroy the much sought-after active principle. Alcohol solved this problem since it evaporates at a much lower temperature than water. Banting and Best were eager to test if they could get a similar result from a fresh adult pancreas; not only were they able to achieve this, but they noted a drop in blood sugar from 0.460% to 0.180% in 3 hours. Thus, there was no need for a degenerated pancreas or a fetal pancreas, as they had initially believed. Rather, a whole pancreas extract with alcohol seemed to be the secret combination.\n\n(12). Macleod, recognizing the breakthrough made by Banting and Best, decided to join in and included J. B. Collip in the team. Collip, an experienced biochemist, was assigned the task of purification. Collip’s purification work was monumental, and, in the winter of 1922, a young 14-year-old diabetic boy was treated with a purified extract made by Collip. The boy’s blood sugar decreased dramatically from 0.520% to 0.120% in the span of a day and his glucose excretion (in urine) dropped from 71.1 g to 8.7 g. The boy also looked brighter, felt better, and had become more active. This incident was noted as the first distinctly successful clinical test on a human diabetic patient who had been injected with the internal secretion of the pancreas. As more patients were treated at the Toronto General Hospital, similar favorable results emerged, and it began to make headlines, capturing the world’s attention. The discovery of insulin is arguably one of Canada’s biggest contributions to medical research, as it completely revolutionized the treatment of diabetes."

The pancreas serves two functions: endocrine and exocrine. The pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans ) contain the hormone-producing endocrine cells, whereas the pancreatic acini ( acinar cells) serve an exocrine function i.e., producing digestive enzymes, which are released into the duodenum via pancreatic ducts. Duct ligation was thus necessary to cause the acini cells to atrophy, leaving behind only the cells from the islets of Langerhans, which could be further investigated.\n\n(6). In Banting’s notebook, which is preserved in the archives of the Academy of Medicine in Toronto, he wrote: “Diabetus. Ligate pancreatic ducts of dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate, leaving Islets. Try to isolate the internal secretion of these to relieve glycosuria.” By ligating the ducts and allowing the acinar cells to degenerate over time, Banting was hoping to isolate the internal secretion of the islet cells without the destructive action of pancreatic enzymes present in the external secretion of the acinar cells. It must be noted that Banting’s idea was not entirely new; several other investigators had attempted to prepare pancreatic extracts. The result of Banting’s tests was a temporary sugar-reducing effect adjoined by adverse side effects, such as fever and abscesses, primarily believed to be caused by impurities in the extract.\n\n(7). Shortly after arriving in London, Ontario, Banting decided to present his ideas to John J. R. Macleod in November of 1920 upon the advice of F. R. Miller , a neurophysiologist whom Banting had assisted with experiments during his tenure/time as a teacher at UWO medical school. Macleod, a physiology professor, and the head of the physiology department at U of T, had great insight into carbohydrate metabolism, and would also be able to provide Banting with a research facility and resources to test his proposal. According to Macleod’s own research, he too held the position that there was an internal secretion of the pancreas that might never be isolated in a pancreatic extract. However, as Banting explained his ideas to Macleod, he was met with skepticism . Macleod, well-versed in the literature, explained that many notable scientists had attempted to isolate this hormone but had failed. Nevertheless, Banting persisted, and after meeting with Macleod two more times, the latter, at last, agreed to arrange laboratory space for Banting to conduct his experiments. Charles H. Best was assigned by Macleod to help Banting test his hypothesis.\n\n(8). Banting and Best’s experimental work began in May of 1921, employing two sets of dogs. The pancreases were removed from the first set , making them diabetic; these dogs would later receive injections with the “isolated internal secretion of the islets cells” to test the success of their experimental techniques/procedures. In the other set of dogs , they ligated the pancreatic ducts to first halt the exocrine activity of the glands, and then harvest secretions from these to treat the diabetic set of dogs. After some initial setbacks, on July 30, Banting and Best noted improvements, albeit temporary, when they administered the sample to the experimentally induced diabetic dog. They repeated their experiments and documented frequent decreases in blood sugar levels in two more de-pancreatized dogs . They named this initial extract “ isletin ”.\n\n(9). Although the duct ligation procedure was of great scientific interest, it was not possible to repeat such procedures on a large scale to produce enough for clinical use. Thus, a better method needed to be discovered.\n\n(10). The duct ligation procedure could not be replicated on a larger scale for numerous reasons. The procedure was complex and time-consuming, involving intricate surgeries that would have been impractical and labor-intensive to perform on large numbers of dogs or other animals. The amount of insulin that could be extracted from a single animal was limited, making it difficult to produce enough for human use. Additionally, the yield of insulin was inconsistent, which made the method unreliable for large-scale production. Another drawback of the procedure was that it caused harm to the animals, meaning it raised significant ethical concerns. In the end, the necessity of performing challenging surgeries, and collecting enough secretions for large scale production, before extracting and purifying the hormones, made the procedure much too slow to feasibly deliver it to the public in large quantities. A better and more efficient system was needed if insulin was to be made readily available for all who required it.\n\n(11). In early December 1921, Banting and Best decided to use alcohol in the preparation of a fetal calf extract. The challenge faced with an aqueous saline extract was that, attempting to concentrate the extract by boiling off the water, this also seemed to destroy the much sought-after active principle. Alcohol solved this problem since it evaporates at a much lower temperature than water. Banting and Best were eager to test if they could get a similar result from a fresh adult pancreas; not only were they able to achieve this, but they noted a drop in blood sugar from 0.460% to 0.180% in 3 hours. Thus, there was no need for a degenerated pancreas or a fetal pancreas, as they had initially believed. Rather, a whole pancreas extract with alcohol seemed to be the secret combination.\n\n(12). Macleod, recognizing the breakthrough made by Banting and Best, decided to join in and included J. B. Collip in the team. Collip, an experienced biochemist, was assigned the task of purification. Collip’s purification work was monumental, and, in the winter of 1922, a young 14-year-old diabetic boy was treated with a purified extract made by Collip. The boy’s blood sugar decreased dramatically from 0.520% to 0.120% in the span of a day and his glucose excretion (in urine) dropped from 71.1 g to 8.7 g. The boy also looked brighter, felt better, and had become more active. This incident was noted as the first distinctly successful clinical test on a human diabetic patient who had been injected with the internal secretion of the pancreas. As more patients were treated at the Toronto General Hospital, similar favorable results emerged, and it began to make headlines, capturing the world’s attention. The discovery of insulin is arguably one of Canada’s biggest contributions to medical research, as it completely revolutionized the treatment of diabetes."
