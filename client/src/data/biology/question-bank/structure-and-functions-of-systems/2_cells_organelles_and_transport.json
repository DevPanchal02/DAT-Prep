Carrier proteins are transport proteins that pass molecules across the membrane through a ligand mediated shape-change. The movement of substances in and out of the cell can be divided into either passive transport (no energy is used) or active transport (energy is required). The energy required for active transport is often supplied in the form of ATP . Osmosis, simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and porins are all examples of passive transport, while carrier proteins often require ATP.",

Tight junctions protect the body from toxins, foreign invaders like bacteria, and the breakdown of concertation gradients. Thus, there would be an issue with a tight junction if substances are getting between two adjacent cells. CC By 4.0",

Osmosis is also a form of passive transport, but it refers to the movement of solvent (i.e. water) rather than the movement of solute (substances dissolved in the solvent).",
