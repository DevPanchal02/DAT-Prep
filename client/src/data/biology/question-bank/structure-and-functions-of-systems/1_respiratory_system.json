When the curve shifts left, the body requires less oxygen (in a relaxed state) and the hemoglobin holds onto oxygen more tightly. When it shifts right, which happens when the body needs more oxygen (like during exercise), hemoglobin releases oxygen more easily. 2,3-DPG is a molecule that accumulates in red blood cells under low oxygen conditions. Lower levels of 2,3-DPG occur when oxygen is plentiful, indicating the body does not need to release oxygen rapidly. Thus, low levels of 2,3-DPG increase hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, resulting in a left shift in the oxygen dissociation curve.",
