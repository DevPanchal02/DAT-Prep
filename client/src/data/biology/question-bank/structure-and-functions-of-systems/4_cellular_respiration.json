Cellular respiration is a catabolic, exergonic, and oxidative process, as glucose ultimately loses electrons (loss of electrons is oxidation), releasing energy that is then stored as ATP.

      "concept_text": "The key to this question is understanding the concept behind cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is the process that cells use to break down organic compounds (most often glucose/ C 6 H 12 O 6 ) into usable forms of energy, like ATP. Since we know that this is aerobic (requires O 2 ) cellular respiration, we should expect glucose and oxygen to be on the left side of the equation. We also know that energy is produced, and should thus be on the right side. Water and the CO 2 that we exhale are byproducts of this process.",
