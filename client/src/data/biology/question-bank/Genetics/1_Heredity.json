Since male progeny always receives their X chromosome from their mother, the maternal genotype is either X B X b or X b X b . This eliminates answer choices B and D. Answer choice A would give progeny with the genotypes X b Y and X b X b . Since Stefan’s sister does not have color blindness, answer choice A is incorrect, as 100% of the female progeny will have color blindness.

Therefore, if the maternal genotype consists of one allele, there is automatically a 50% chance of having a son with color blindness. If the mother is color blind, there is a 100% chance of having a son with color blindness. However, females have two X chromosomes, so two copies of the color blindness gene are necessary for females to present with color blindness. Females inherit one X chromosome from their father and one from their mother. Therefore, the father must have the allele for color blindness and must mate with a female that is heterozygous (50% of having a daughter that is color blind) or homozygous recessive (100% chance of having a daughter that is color blind.

Shapes distinguish between the sex of the individual, with squares signifying males and circles being females. Shading indicates that the individual is affected by the condition, with white indicating that the individual has the wild-type phenotype. A shaded square would therefore be a male affected by Huntington’s disease. CC By 4.0",
