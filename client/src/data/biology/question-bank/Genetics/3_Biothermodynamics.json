However, remember that increasing substrate concentration will overcome the effect of competitive inhibition. If there is more substrate present, it is more likely to interact with the active site. If a substance mimics a substrate’s properties and tries to bind to its site, the substance will have a decreased ability to bind, hence why the K m is raised. V max is unchanged because although binding affinity has decreased, it can be overcome by adding additional substrate, and still reaching desired V max­ .

The process of ATP hydrolysis is a very exergonic reaction, because phosphate groups have negative charges that repel each other.

ATP is commonly used to power non-spontaneous reactions by storing the energy that gets released in spontaneous reactions. Coupling subsequent non-spontaneous reactions to the highly exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis allows these non-spontaneous reactions to proceed. ATP hydrolysis is exergonic, while reforming ATP from ADP is endergonic (requires energy). ATP’s role in metabolic pathways is analogous to a rechargeable battery, as shown below:",

Importantly, catalysts do not change the equilibrium or Gibbs Free Energy (Δ G) of a reaction. They only accelerate reactions that would already energetically proceed. Since catalysts are not altered or consumed by the reactions that they catalyze, they can be reused. This means that even very small amounts of catalyst can drastically increase the reaction rate.

Enzymes can also be regulated via chemical modification , from the cleavage of a proenzyme into its active form, or another molecule binding to alter the enzyme’s activity level (ex. phosphorylation, modulators, etc.). All enzymes have an ideal range of pH and temperature that they can function in. The further that the temperature and pH deviate from an enzyme’s ideal conditions, the lower the reaction rate, as the enzyme starts to denature and lose function. Importantly, enzymes are not directly affected by the equilibrium or Gibbs Free Energy (Δ G) of a reaction. Enzymes can only accelerate reactions that would already energetically proceed.",

Another way to describe an exergonic reaction is that the products have less free energy than the reactants because energy is given off in the process of the reaction so when you take the free energy of the products minus the free energy of the reactants, it results in a negative ΔG.
