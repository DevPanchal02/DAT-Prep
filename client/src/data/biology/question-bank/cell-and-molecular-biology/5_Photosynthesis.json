Since there is no sunlight while the plant is taking in CO 2 , there are no ATP or NADPH molecules produced from the light-dependent reactions to power the Calvin cycle. Thus, the CO 2 is converted into malic acid and stored in a vacuole until the day time, when the stomata are closed and the light reactions can occur.

This is beneficial to the Calvin cycle because it prevents RuBisCo (the first enzyme in the Calvin cycle) from being exposed to oxygen, its competitive inhibitor. If RuBisCo binds to oxygen instead of CO 2 , the plant will begin the wasteful process of photorespiration instead of producing glucose. This is why C4 plants evolved to spatially isolate RuBisCo from oxygen’s presence by performing the Calvin cycle in the bundle sheath cells.",
