PFK undergoes allosteric regulation, which means certain molecules can bind to a site on the enzyme other than the active site and alter the enzyme’s ability to catalyze reactions. PFK is negatively regulated by high levels of ATP, as this indicates that plenty of cellular energy is available. On the other hand, low levels of ATP promote PFK activity, as this indicates a shortage of cellular energy.",

One glucose molecule produces two pyruvates, which in turn means two Acetyl-CoA molecules are generated during pyruvate decarboxylation ( one Acetyl-CoA per pyruvate ). Generating Acetyl-CoA from pyruvate requires the oxidation of pyruvate via one molecule of NAD + per pyruvate , thus, two molecules of NADH are produced. Finally, the oxidation of pyruvate with NAD + results in the loss of one carboxylate group (CO 2 ) per pyruvate . Thus, two CO 2 molecules are generated. The two Acetyl-CoA’s enter the TCA cycle, the two NADH are used in the ETC, and the two CO 2 are exhaled in the lungs via organismal respiration. CC By 4.0",

Note that this question asks about the products from one pyruvate molecule, not one glucose molecule. During pyruvate decarboxylation, each of the two pyruvate molecules that were produced from one glucose molecule during glycolysis are oxidized (lose electrons) and turned into acetyl CoA . As each pyruvate molecule is oxidized, one NAD + gets reduced into NADH, meaning that in this step, two NADH are produced per glucose. One CO 2 molecule per pyruvate is also produced (one per pyruvate). This means that for one pyruvate, 1 acetyl CoA, 1 NADH, and 1 CO 2 are produced, while for one glucose molecule, we would 2 of each product instead. This step occurs in the mitochondrial matrix .",

The electron transport chain is the final step of cellular respiration, whose main purpose is to produce ATP, unlike the previous steps. It is important to know that eukaryotes produce about 2 fewer ATP per glucose molecule than prokaryotes. This is because in eukaryotes, the products of glycolysis must be shuttled from the cytosol into the mitochondria for pyruvate decarboxylation, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain. In prokaryotes, the electron transport chain occurs across the cellular membrane , rather than the inner mitochondrial membrane, since prokaryotes do not have membrane bound organelles.

This process is important because it allows NAD + to be reused in other metabolic reactions (such as glycolysis) and helps to maintain the balance of NADH and NAD + in the cell. In organisms that usually undergo aerobic respiration, if oxygen is present, this oxidation of electron carriers (NADH and FADH 2 ) occurs at the electron transport chain , regenerating NAD + and FADH. Organisms that cannot undergo aerobic respiration rely exclusively on fermentation or anaerobic respiration (cellular respiration in which the final electron acceptor is a molecule other than O 2 ).",

Beta oxidation occurs in the mitochondrial matrix and involves a series of reactions that break down the fatty acid chain into numerous acetyl CoA molecules. Acetyl CoA can be further oxidized in the citric acid cycle to produce energy in the form of ATP. During beta-oxidation, each two-carbon unit removed from the fatty acid chain is converted into acetyl CoA, which generates one molecule of NADH and one molecule of FADH 2 . The NADH and FADH 2 molecules are used to transfer electrons to the electron transport chain, where they can be used to generate even more ATP.",

Glycogenolysis is the opposite of glycogenesis, and it occurs when the body needs more glucose. Glycogenolysis involves the breakdown of glycogen into G6Ps . Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is the first intermediate of glycolysis, which is formed after hexokinase adds one phosphate group onto glucose. G6P molecules can easily enter glycolysis at this step and proceed through cellular respiration to produce significant amounts of ATP.",
