Before division starts, each cell replicates all of its DNA during the S phase of interphase . Human somatic cells are diploid cells that contain 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total chromosomes).

Thus, right before cell division, a human somatic cell contains 46 chromosomes but 92 chromatids. This duplication must occur before cell division starts so that each daughter cell at the end of mitosis has the correct number of chromosomes.",

Binary fission is a type of bacterial asexual reproduction, while conjugation and transduction are transfer mechanisms for genetic material,  not forms of cell division.",
