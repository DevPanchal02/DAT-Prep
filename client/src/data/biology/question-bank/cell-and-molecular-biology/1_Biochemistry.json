      "concept_text": "Polar covalent bonds are chemical bonds formed between atoms that share electrons and have different electronegativities. On the other hand, hydrogen bonds are a type of bond formed when a Hydrogen (H) atom is bound to a highly electronegative atom (such as F, O, or N), causing the Hydrogen atom to take on a more positive charge. The more positively charged hydrogen atom is then attracted to another highly electronegative atom with at least one lone pair of electrons (typically F, O, or N). You may be wondering why the bond in red is not a hydrogen bond. The hydrogen bond shown in the picture is polar covalent because it is a direct covalent bond between N and H atoms. A hydrogen bond would only be formed in this case if this ammonia molecule interacted with another ammonia molecule, as seen below: CC By 4.0",

In the scenario of putting sugar in water, water acts as the solvent while sugar acts as the solute. The image below shows NaCl mixed with water. Note that hydrogen will encircle negatively charged ions, while oxygen will encircle positively charged ions. Water is a very reliable solvent primarily due to the polarity it contains. However, it is important to note that, although the versatility of water as a solvent is vast, water is not a universal solvent. If it was, any container holding water, including our cells would be dissolved. CC By 4.0",

This means that if you start with solid water (ice) and increase the pressure, it will change into liquid water. This is because in liquid water, the water molecules are closer together than they are in ice (ice is less dense than water). The structured hydrogen bonds in ice prevent the molecules from getting as close together, leading to the decreased density. In most other substances, if you increase the pressure on a liquid, it will transition to the solid phase. This translates to a positive slope between the liquid and solid forms.",

      "concept_text": "The melting temperature of a DNA strand refers to the temperature required to break the hydrogen bonding base pairs and separate the two strands. DNA strands with a higher concentration of Cytosine and Guanine nucleotides have higher melting points, because C and G are held together with 3 hydrogen bonds, while Adenine and Thymine are only held together with 2 hydrogen bonds. Although this question’s answer choices only provide the sequence for one of the DNA strands, only one of the strands is necessary to determine which choice would have the most G-C bonds, and thus the highest melting point.",
