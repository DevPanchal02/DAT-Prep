      "concept_text": "Within the folds of the stomach are gastric glands containing various types of cells. Mucous cells secrete mucus which serve to lubricate and protect the lining of the stomach from the highly acidic juices of the stomach. Parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid, as well as intrinsic factor.  The acidic hydrochloric acid (HCl) is responsible for the activation of pepsinogen into its active form pepsin, as well as the breakdown of proteins. Intrinsic factor ensures that vitamin B12 gets absorbed in the small intestine. Chief cells secrete pepsinogen and gastric lipase. Pepsinogen is the zymogen (inactive precursor) of pepsin which is a protease responsible for the breakdown of proteins. Gastric lipase is involved in the breakdown of fats. G cells secrete the hormone gastrin.  Gastrin has multiple functions, one of which is the stimulation of parietal cells to secrete hydrochloric acid. Gastrin also functions to stimulate chief cells to secrete pepsinogen and gastric lipase. Goblet cells are NOT found in the stomach. Goblet cells are found in the small intestine and are responsible for the secretion of mucus in order to protect the epithelial lining of the small intestine. Because goblet cells are not found in the stomach, Option E . is the correct answer to this question.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Mucous cells – This option is incorrect Mucous cells do in fact exist in the stomach. Mucous cells are responsible for the production and secretion of mucus which lubricates as well as protects the lining of the stomach from the acidic environment. Option B. Chief cells – This option is incorrect. Chief cells exist in the stomach and are stimulated by gastrin to secrete pepsinogen and gastric lipase. Pepsinogen is a zymogen (inactive precursor) and gets converted into the active form pepsin via the acidic environment within the stomach. Pepsin functions to digest proteins while gastric lipase functions to digest fats. Option C. Parietal cell – This option is incorrect. Parietal cells are cells of the stomach that secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl) and intrinsic factor. HCl creates an acidic environment within the stomach that converts pepsinogen into pepsin. In addition, HCl assists with the denaturation and digestion of proteins and the destruction of pathogens. Intrinsic factor ensures that vitamin B12 gets absorbed in the small intestine. Option D.

      "concept_text": "Recall that nutrients are exchanged between the circulatory system and target tissues at the capillaries . At the arteriole end of the capillary, fluid is pushed out of the blood vessel via hydrostatic pressure. Fluid is then pulled back into the blood vessel on the venule end of the capillary via osmotic pressure, however, not ALL of the fluid in the interstitial space is pulled back into the blood vessels. Instead, the remaining interstitial fluid enters lymphatic vessels where the fluid becomes what is known as lymph . Some of the functions of the lymphatic system include preventing the buildup of excess fluid in tissues (swelling), immune function via lymph nodes, and the transportation of absorbed fat from the small intestine to the blood. There are some general details about the lymphatic system that you should know for your test: It is also important to note that the lymphatic system lacks a central pump, such as the heart. Therefore, lymph is pushed through lymphatic vessels in two primary ways. Similar to the veins in the blood circulatory system, skeletal muscle contractions will push lymph through the lymphatic vessels via the skeletal muscle pump . Lymphatic vessels also possess smooth muscles which push lymph through the vessels via peristalsis . Lymph nodes are NOT able to contract and do NOT contribute to the movement of lymph; therefore, Option D . is the correct answer to this question.",

The lymphatic system is a low-pressure system and therefore, lymph must reenter the blood circulation in a low-pressure area. Recall that venous circulation is also low-pressure. Therefore, lymph reenters the blood circulation near the heart at the end of venous circulation, specifically, into the left and right subclavian vein. Because the location of re-entry MUST be in a low-pressure area, the location of re-entry does affect the circulation of lymph throughout the body. Option B. Smooth muscle contractions – This option is incorrect. Recall that the lymphatic system does not have a central pump, like the heart. Instead of a central pump, the contraction of skeletal muscles will push lymph through the lymphatic vessels via the skeletal muscle pump.

Extraembryonic membranes are membranes that develop outside of the embryo proper in birds, reptiles, and mammals. The 4 extraembryonic membranes that you need to know are: the chorion , amnion , allantois , and yolk sac . This question asks about the allantois, so let’s focus our attention there. The allantois is a sac that buds off of the archenteron (a structure of the gastrula) that will eventually encircle the embryo and form the chorion. The allantois is a multifunctional membrane and has slightly different functions in egg-laying animals and placental animals. In egg-laying animals (like birds), the allantois is initially used to store uric acid but will later fuse with the chorion to form a membrane for gas exchange. In placental animals, the allantois will transport waste products to the placenta and develop into the umbilical cord later in development. The allantois will also become the urinary bladder in adults. Because the allantois initially stores uric acid and later fuses with the chorion for gas exchange in egg-laying animals (like birds), Option E . is the correct answer to this question. CC By 4.0",

Recall that the placenta is the tissue where gases, nutrients, and wastes are exchanged between the fetus and the mother. Option B. Yolk sac – This option is incorrect .  In egg-laying animals, the yolk sac provides nourishment to the developing embryo. In placental animals, the yolk sac is not as important for nourishing the embryo as the placenta is responsible for nourishment. In placental animals, the yolk sac is the first site of red blood cell synthesis. Option C. Amnion – This option is incorrect .  The amnion is the innermost extraembryonic membrane. The amnion contains amniotic fluid that functions to cushion and protect the developing embryo. It is important to note that amphibians to not possess an amnion. Option D. Placenta – This option is incorrect .  The placenta is an organ that develops during pregnancy in placental mammals.

      "concept_text": "Recall that diploid (2n) cells are cells that contain two complete sets of chromosomes. In other words, diploid cells possess homologous chromosome pairs, 1 from the father and one from the mother. Humans are diploid organisms which means our somatic cells have two sets of chromosomes. In contrast, haploid (n) cells are cells that possess a single set of unpaired chromosomes. When diploid germ cells undergo meiosis, the daughter cells (gametes) are haploid. For this question, we need to understand a concept known as alternation of generations . Alternation of generations is a life cycle that’s observed in certain organisms like plants, fungi, and some protists. Alternation of generations is a process by which an organism will alternate between diploid (2n) and haploid (n) stages. While this process is a cycle, let’s begin in the sporophyte stage. Sporophytes are diploid and possess structures known as sporangia . When sporangia undergo meiosis, they produce haploid spores . These haploid spores will undergo mitosis to become a multicellular gametophyte that is still haploid (recall the spores that underwent mitosis to produce the gametophyte are haploid). The gametophyte is responsible for producing gametes which we should know are haploid. When two gametes fuse during fertilization, it produces a diploid zygote . This zygote will then undergo mitosis to become a multicellular diploid sporophyte. We’ve now finished the complete cycle! Bryophytes are non-vascular plants. Recall that vascular tissue consists of xylem and phloem. Examples of bryophytes include mosses, hornworts, and liverworts.

Pine trees are examples of conifers, which are gymnosperms. Gymnosperms are vascular plants whose seeds are not protected. Gymnosperms spend the majority of their lifecycle in the sporophyte stage, not the gametophyte stage. Option D. Sunflowers – This option is incorrect. Sunflowers are examples of angiosperms. Angiosperms are flower-bearing plants. Recall that the flower is the reproductive structure of the plant and it is composed of 3 primary components: the pistil, the stamen, and the pedals. Angiosperms spend the majority of their lifecycle in the sporophyte stage, not the gametophyte stage. Option E. Quillworts – This option is incorrect.

      "concept_text": "Mammals , as the name suggests, are organisms that belong to the class Mammalia. For this question, we need to know that all mammals possess a diaphragm and in fact, the diaphragm is a structure exclusive to mammals. The diaphragm is a thin skeletal muscle that marks the lower border of the thoracic cavity. It is also important to note that the diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve. Recall that inspiration is the intake of oxygen into the body which is required for aerobic cellular respiration. Inspiration is facilitated by the contraction of the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles. Together, these muscles pull the lungs down and expand the thoracic cavity. Ultimately, this increases the volume in the lungs as well as decreases the intrapleural pressure, pulling air into the lungs. Once the air is in the lungs, the alveoli serve as the surface area of gas exchange between the respiratory system and the circulatory system. Once the oxygen has entered the circulatory system, blood will transport that oxygen throughout the body as required. CC By 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Fur – This option is incorrect. Fur is a natural layer of dense, thicker hair that’s found on the surface of many mammals. Fur primarily serves to provide insulation, camouflage, and protection. For this answer choice, it is important to note that not all mammals possess fur. For example, humans possess hair, which is a fine, thread-like structure that can be found in all areas of the body. While both hair and fur are made from keratin-based filaments, fur is a much thicker and denser layer than hair. While all mammals will possess hair or fur at some point in their lives, some species will shed this hair or fur later in development. Common examples of mammals that don’t keep their hair or fur are whales, dolphins, and porpoises who generally only have hair at birth. Option B. Feathers – This option is incorrect. The most well-known organisms that possess feathers are birds. Feathers have a few different functions. Some of these functions include insulation, flight, camouflage, and protection, among others. Mammals do not possess feathers. Option C. Sweat glands – This option is incorrect. Sweat glands, also known as sudoriferous glands, are glands in the skin that produce sweat. There are two different types of sweat glands: eccrine sweat glands and apocrine sweat glands. Eccrine sweat glands are the most abundant type of sweat glands, and they help with thermoregulation. Apocrine sweat glands are slightly bigger than eccrine sweat glands and are located in the arm pit, pubic region and nipples. The secretions from apocrine sweat glands are more viscous and are secreted into hair follicles. The function of apocrine secretions primarily depends on their location. While sweat glands are a common feature among many mammals, not all mammals possess sweat glands. Option E. Tail bone – This option is incorrect. The tail bone, also known as the coccyx, is a bone located at the base of the vertebral column in certain vertebrates. Many mammals possess a bony tail and therefore, have a tail bone, however, not all mammals have a tail bone. For example, whales and dolphins do not possess a tail bone. It is also worth noting that while humans possess a tail bone, it does not have a function and is therefore considered an evolutionary remnant, known as a vestigial structure.",

      "concept_text": "The kidney is the most important organ of the excretory system. Kidneys are comprised of nephrons which are the functional unit of the kidney. Within the nephron, blood is filtered, minerals are secreted and reabsorbed, specialized cells monitor blood pressure, and wastes are excreted in the form of urine. Let’s briefly touch on each of these functions. The function of the nephron begins with the filtration of blood within the renal corpuscle, which is made up of the glomerulus and Bowman’s capsule. Within the renal corpuscle, water and small solutes like electrolytes and glucose will enter the filtrate whereas larger molecules like blood cells and proteins will remain in the circulation. Reabsorption is the process where substances will exit the filtrate and re-enter the circulation. Reabsorption begins in the proximal convoluted tubule and ends in the collecting duct. The most common substances that get reabsorbed in the nephron are water, glucose and amino acids, and electrolytes like sodium (NA + ), potassium (K + ), chloride (Cl - ), etc. Secretion is the opposite of reabsorption. Secretion is the movement of substances from the circulation into the filtrate of the nephron. Secretion primarily occurs in the proximal and distal convoluted tubules. The most common substances that are secreted in the nephron are potassium (K + ), hydrogen (H + ), and wastes that will enter the nephron for excretion. After reabsorption and secretion has occurred in the nephron, the filtrate will travel out of the collecting duct, at which point the filtrate is now known as urine. The urine will be sent through a ureter to the bladder where said urine is stored until excretion. Near the glomerulus are specialized cells, known as juxtaglomerular cells . These cells monitor blood pressure. If the juxtaglomerular cells detect that blood pressure is low, these cells will release renin which initiates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Ultimately, RAAS is responsible for the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone is a hormone that will increase sodium (NA + ) and water reabsorption, as well as potassium (K + ) secretion in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. The sodium and water reabsorption will lead to an increase in blood pressure. For this question, it is important to understand that nutrient absorption is the absorption of nutrients from the intestinal tract into circulation. Kidneys perform reabsorption, which is a different process. Reabsorption is the transportation of nutrients, often times electrolytes, from the filtrate of the nephron back into circulation. The absorption of nutrients does NOT occur in the kidneys; therefore Option E . is the correct answer to this question. CC By 4.0",

Some of these substances include wastes, like creatinine, drugs, and toxins. Other substances that are secreted include minerals, like potassium (K + )! Option C. Filter blood – This option is incorrect . Recall that one of the functions of the nephron is the filtration of blood.

Recall that specialized cells near the glomerulus, known as juxtaglomerular cells, monitor blood pressure and release renin when blood pressure is low. This initiates that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) which will ultimately end in the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex when blood pressure is low. Aldosterone will result in the reabsorption of sodium (Na + ) and water, as well as the secretion of potassium (K + ) in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. The reabsorption of sodium (Na + ) and water will lead to an increase in blood pressure.",

Option D. Posterior pituitary – This option is incorrect .  The posterior pituitary is one of the two lobes that make up the pituitary gland. The posterior pituitary is continuous with the hypothalamus, and therefore, doesn’t actually produce its own hormones. Instead, the hypothalamus produces antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin which the posterior pituitary is responsible for secreting. The posterior pituitary does not produce epinephrine. Option E.

Natural selection describes the non-random increase or decrease in allele frequencies in order to adapt to the environment. You may recognize the term “survival of the fittest” which is in direct relation to natural selection. Recall that fitness describes an organism’s ability to survive and produce viable offspring. In essence, the organisms that possess the most fit alleles (alleles that increase the chances of survival) will be able to survive and pass on those alleles to their offspring. Over time, these alleles become more prevalent within a population and the less fit alleles are filtered out. It is also important to note that there are three primary forms of natural selection: stabilizing selection , disruptive selection , and directional selection . Because natural selection describes a process by which heritable alleles that increase fitness are passed on to offspring, Option C . is the correct answer to this question.",

Genetic variation occurs as a result of random changes in a gene – This option is incorrect .  Recall that natural selection is a non-random process by which alleles that increase the chances of survival are passed on to offspring and increase in frequency within a population. Natural selection is not a result of random changes in a gene, or mutations. Option B. Certain traits become heritable as a result of greater usage of that trait – This option is incorrect .  Recall that Lamarck’s theory of use and disuse proposed that body parts which were used more frequently would develop more while body parts that are not used frequently will atrophy away. Lamarck also proposed his theory of inheritance of acquired traits whereby traits that are acquired during one’s life will be passed to offspring. These theories have been disproven and it also does not describe the theory of natural selection which was proposed by Charles Darwin. Option D. Deliberate selection of desirable traits in a species by humans – This option is incorrect .  Artificial selection is a type of selection performed by humans by which desirable traits are selected and bred for. Artificial selection is commonly seen in dogs. Dogs with favorable traits are bred so those favorable traits can be passed to their offspring. Option E. Intermediate traits are favored in a population – This option is incorrect .  This option is describing stabilizing selection, which is one of the three primary types of natural selection. When a species undergoes stabilizing selection, traits at each end of the extreme are selected against and the intermediate traits are favored.

      "concept_text": "Let us first define some basic terms. A population is the collection of all members of the same species that live in a certain area. A community is the broader collection of all of the populations found in an area. Biological diversity or biodiversity describes both the richness and evenness of a community. The richness of a community describes the number of different species present without regard for their population count. The evenness of a community describes the relative population size of each species in a community. For example, consider a community with 1000 species A and 2000 species B, and another community with 1500 species A and 1500 species B. The two communities have the same richness because they both have 2 different species. However, the second community exhibits greater evenness because both species are present in 50% abundance in contrast to the 33% and 66% distribution found in the first community. First, we can examine the question choices on the basis of richness. We can say that communities C and D are the  richest because they both have 5 different species. Second, we can examine the question choices on the basis of evenness. We can say that communities A and D are the most even since the relative abundance of all present species is the same within these communities. Finally, we find that the community that exhibits both high richness and evenness will have the highest diversity among all of the other communities. From the given option choices, Community D exhibits both high richness and evenness. Therefore, Option D . Desert: 20, 20, 20, 20, 20 , is the correct answer.",

      "concept_text": "For this question, we need to understand that short bursts of intense exercise are forms of anaerobic exercise . Recall that when oxygen is present, humans will undergo aerobic cellular respiration in order to produce ATP, which is the energy currency of the cell. However, when oxygen is absent (or is not present in sufficient amounts for the needs of the cell, which can occur during intense exercise), humans are not able to utilize aerobic cellular respiration. Recall that during aerobic respiration, oxygen is the final electron acceptor. If oxygen is absent, humans will have to produce ATP anaerobically. In order to do this, they will utilize fermentation and glycolysis . Recall that glycolysis is the first step of aerobic cellular respiration. During glycolysis, a glucose molecule is broken down into two pyruvate molecules. During the process, two NAD + are oxidized into NADH. In addition, a net of two ATP is produced. The final yield resulting from glycolysis with the use of one glucose molecule is two pyruvate , two NADH , and two ATP . It’s very important to remember that glycolysis can only proceed if NAD + is present. It turns out that NAD + is also required for the next two steps of aerobic respiration to proceed: pyruvate decarboxylation and the Krebs cycle, respectively. NAD + gets regenerated during the final step of aerobic respiration, known as the oxidative phosphorylation. We won’t get into the details of oxidative phosphorylation for this solution but just know that NADH and FADH 2 are oxidized into NAD + and FAD. This is how NAD + gets regenerated so it can be used again during the pyruvate decarboxylation step and the Krebs cycle. However, oxygen is the final electron acceptor during oxidative phosphorylation, so oxidative phosphorylation can only proceed if oxygen is available. This is why oxidative phosphorylation directly relies on oxygen and the pyruvate decarboxylation step and the Krebs cycle indirectly rely on oxygen. So, if NAD + is required for glycolysis to proceed, where does glycolysis get it from? The answer to that question is fermentation . Fermentation is a completely anaerobic process and resupplies glycolysis with NAD + so glycolysis can continue to produce ATP in the absence of oxygen. There are two types of fermentation that you need to know for your test: lactic acid fermentation and alcohol fermentation . Humans undergo lactic acid fermentation whereby the pyruvate that’s produced from glycolysis will not undergo the pyruvate decarboxylation step, but instead, will enter the fermentation pathway. From here, the pyruvate will be converted into lactate while NADH is oxidized into NAD + . This NAD + can be used to continue glycolysis. An image outlining lactic acid fermentation can be found below. If a student were to spring across campus in a short bit of intense exercise, that student would be placed under brief anaerobic conditions, resulting from a lack of available oxygen. This would cause that student to undergo glycolysis and lactic acid fermentation for their energy requirements. Recall that lactic acid fermentation is the conversion of pyruvate into lactate within the myocyte (muscle cell). Because of this, Option A. is the correct answer to this question. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. O 2 , ethanol – This option is incorrect. While it is true that sprinting leads to a decrease in the availability of oxygen (O 2 ), humans undergo lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid fermentation is the conversion of pyruvate into lactate. Alcohol fermentation, on the other hand, is the conversion of pyruvate into acetaldehyde and then ethanol. Yeast undergo alcohol fermentation. Humans undergo lactic acid fermentation, and therefore, would not produce ethanol. Option C. CO 2 , lactate – This option is incorrect. Sprinting across campus would result in a decrease in the availability of oxygen (O 2 ), not carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Because oxygen is not available (or less available), humans will undergo glycolysis and lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid fermentation is the conversion of pyruvate into lactate, therefore, there would be an increase in the production of lactate. Option D. Lactate, insulin– This option is incorrect. Sprinting across campus would result in a decrease in the amount of oxygen (O 2 ) that’s available. This would lead humans to undergo glycolysis and lactic acid fermentation during this brief anaerobic period. Lactic acid fermentation is the conversion of pyruvate into lactate, therefore, there would be an increase, not a decrease in lactate. Insulin is a hormone that decreases blood glucose levels. Insulin does not play a role in the metabolic processes being tested in this question. Option E. Ethanol, glucagon – This option is incorrect. Sprinting across campus would result in a decrease in the amount of oxygen (O 2 ) that’s available. This would lead humans to undergo glycolysis and lactic acid fermentation during this brief anaerobic period. Lactic acid fermentation is the conversion of pyruvate into lactate. Alcohol fermentation is the other form of fermentation performed by yeast, not humans. Alcohol fermentation is the conversion of pyruvate into acetaldehyde and then ethanol. Humans would NOT produce ethanol. Additionally, glucagon is a hormone that plays a role in the increase of blood glucose levels.

      "concept_text": "Allopatric speciation is the formation of new species, speciation , due to reproductive isolation resulting from a geographic barrier. This geographic barrier separates a population and interrupts gene flow. As a result, the gene pool diverges enough that reproduction between the separated population is no longer possible because the gametes are no longer compatible. Due to the lack of breeding between the separated populations and the evolution of each population to their respective environment, new species will be formed. In contrast, sympatric speciation is a speciation event that occurs without geographic barriers. Instead, reproductive isolation occurs by other mechanisms (balanced polymorphism, polyploidy, and hybridization). The image below illustrates this concept. CC BY 4.0",

Heterotrophs are organisms that are not capable of producing their own food and therefore, intake nutrients from the surroundings like plant and animal matter. Autotrophs, on the other hand, are organisms that are capable of producing their own organic substances from inorganic substances. The most common autotrophic process is photosynthesis whereby photons from the sun are utilized to convert carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O) into organic glucose with the release of atmospheric oxygen as a byproduct. While the complexity of autotrophs and heterotrophs varies greatly, it is most likely that the very first organisms on earth were heterotrophic, utilizing the available carbon sources from their environment.

Because of this, Option B. is the correct answer to this question.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Autotrophic eukaryotes – This option is incorrect. Recall that eukaryotes possess membrane-bound organelles, unlike prokaryotes. Because of this, prokaryotes are simpler organisms than eukaryotes. Additionally, heterotrophs are organisms that cannot produce their own food. Autotrophs, on the other hand, are able to produce their own food. It is likely that the first organisms on earth were heterotrophic, utilizing the organic carbon that was available from their environment. In summary, heterotrophic prokaryotes are simpler than autotrophic eukaryotes. The most primordial organisms on earth are also going to be the simplest organisms, therefore, heterotrophic prokaryotes would be the first organisms on earth. Option C. Unicellular eukaryotes – This option is incorrect. Unicellular eukaryotes are known as protists. Recall that eukaryotes possess membrane-bound organelles whereas prokaryotes do not. This makes eukaryotes more complex than prokaryotes. The most primordial organisms would be the simplest organisms. Therefore, this very first organisms would’ve been prokaryotes and not eukaryotes. Option D. Photosynthetic prokaryotes – This option is incorrect. Photosynthesis is a complex autotrophic process whereby photons from the sun are used to convert carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O) into glucose with the release of atmospheric oxygen as a byproduct. Recall that the first organisms to utilize photosynthesis were cyanobacteria, however, cyanobacteria were not the first organisms on earth. Option E. Autotrophic archaea – This option is incorrect. Heterotrophs are organisms that cannot produce their own food. Autotrophs, on the other hand, are able to produce their own food. The most common autotrophic process is photosynthesis which is the utilization of photons from the sun to convert carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O) into glucose with the release of atmospheric oxygen (O 2 ) as a byproduct. Recall that both archaea and bacteria are prokaryotic organisms and therefore, lack membrane-bound organelles. For this answer choice, we need to know that the first organism on earth was likely heterotrophic that intakes organic substances from its surroundings.",

      "concept_text": "For this question, we need to understand feedback loops . When discussing feedback loops for the biology section, it is usually in reference to the endocrine system. Feedback loops are regulatory mechanisms whereby the release of a particular hormone will signal for the inhibition of a particular endocrine tissue ( negative feedback ) or the amplification of a particular endocrine tissue ( positive feedback ). Recall that the hypothalamus is a tissue of the brain that responsible for the production of a variety of hormones, some of which are corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), somatostatin, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and oxytocin. The hypothalamus is involved in both positive and negative feedback loops, however, the primary regulatory mechanism of the hypothalamus involved negative feedback loops. One such example of a negative feedback loop involving the hypothalamus is the secretion of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) via the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. This negative feedback cycle begins with the secretion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. TRH will signal the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary. Thyroid-stimulating hormone will then signal the release of both thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) from the thyroid gland. Once T4 and T3 have been released, the body will detect this and cause a negative feedback loop on the hypothalamus, inhibiting the releasing of thyrotropin-releasing hormone. This will also inhibit the continued secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone from the anterior pituitary and therefore, the thyroid gland will stop secreting thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). This negative feedback loop helps maintain homeostasis and prevents the over secretion of a particular hormone(s). An image depicting the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is shown below. One example of a positive feedback loop involving the hypothalamus is observed during the female menstrual cycle. Recall that ovulation is a result of a spike in luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. This spike in LH is a result of a positive feedback loop! During the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, estrogen levels continuously rise. Once the estrogen levels reach a certain threshold, it will cause a positive feedback loop on the hypothalamus, ultimately causing the hypothalamus to secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) This GnRH will lead to a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary, ultimately causing ovulation! It should be noted that positive feedback loops do NOT return an organism to homeostasis but instead, push an organism even further beyond homeostasis. While the hypothalamus is involved in both positive and negative feedback loops, negative feedback loops are much more common and are the primary regulatory mechanism of the hypothalamus used to maintain homeostasis. Therefore, Option A . is the correct answer to this question. CC By 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Positive Feedback – This option is incorrect .  Recall that the hypothalamus is involved in both negative and positive feedback loops. Negative feedback loops will help return an organism to homeostasis whereas positive feedback loops will push an organism beyond homeostasis. Additionally, positive feedback loops are much rarer for the hypothalamus than negative feedback loops. Negative feedback loops are the primary regulatory mechanism of the hypothalamus that helps maintain homeostasis. Option C. Cell Cycle Checkpoint – This option is incorrect .  Cell cycle checkpoints are involved in cell division. Recall that there are three cell cycle checkpoints that you should know for your test. The first checkpoint occurs at the end of gap phase 1 (G1). The second checkpoint occurs at the end of gap phase 2 (G2). The third checkpoint occurs during metaphase. These checkpoints ensure that cell division occurs properly. The cell cycle checkpoints have nothing to do with feedback loops or maintaining homeostasis on a system level. Option D. Secondary Messenger Cascade – This option is incorrect .  Recall that secondary messengers are molecules that transmit signals from the surface of the cell to the inside of the cell. Secondary messengers are often used to transmit a signal from a peptide hormone to inside of the cell. Recall that peptide hormones are water-soluble and therefore, cannot freely diffuse across the membrane of the cell. Because of this, peptide hormones must utilize secondary messengers in order to relay their message to the intracellular environment. The secondary messengers that you need to know for your test are cyclic AMP (cAMP), inositol triphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG), and calcium ions. While the hypothalamus does produce and secrete lipid-insoluble hormones, secondary messenger cascades do not regulate the hypothalamus. They simply transmit a signal from outside of a target cell to the inside of that cell. Option E. Suppressor Gene – This option is incorrect .  Suppressor genes are genes that regulate cell division and prevent the development of cancer. Some common examples of suppressor genes are p53, p21, and retinoblastoma gene. Suppressor genes are not directly involved with the function of the hypothalamus.",

      "concept_text": "Oxygen (O 2 ) is the final electron acceptor in the process of aerobic cellular respiration. Recall that aerobic cellular respiration is the primary metabolic process that aerobic organisms utilize to produce ATP, which is the energy currency of the cell. As the name suggests, aerobic cellular respiration requires oxygen to proceed. Aerobic respiration can be broken down into 4 primary stages: Oxidative phosphorylation , as we can see, is the final stage of aerobic respiration. Oxidative phosphorylation involves an electron transport chain as well as the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP via chemiosmosis . During oxidative phosphorylation, the electron transport chain (found in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes and the cell membrane of prokaryotes) will oxidize NADH and FADH 2 into NAD + and FAD. At this point, it is important to mention that protein complex I will oxidize NADH and protein complex II will oxidize FADH 2 . The electrons that are released from the oxidation of NADH and FADH 2 will be passed down the electron transport chain which consists of 4 protein complexes. As the electrons are being passed from one complex to the next, the energy that’s released is used to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. This creates an electrochemical gradient which is important for chemiosmosis. Once the protons have been pumped into the intermembrane space, they will be pumped through ATP synthase back into the mitochondrial matrix. This pumping of protons through ATP synthase will phosphorylate ADP into ATP via chemiosmosis. For this question, it is crucial to understand that oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor for oxidative phosphorylation. Oxygen will combine with electrons and protons to form water (H 2 O) which is the reason that oxidative phosphorylation DIRECTLY depends on oxygen. As we see, oxidative phosphorylation is responsible for the production of ATP and water as well as the oxidation of NADH and FADH 2 into NAD + and FAD. This oxidation is important because the pyruvate decarboxylation step and the Krebs cycle rely on NAD + to proceed. Oxidative phosphorylation is responsible for replenishing the NAD + stores that are used in pyruvate decarboxylation and the Krebs cycle. In this way, pyruvate decarboxylation and the Krebs cycle INDIRECTLY rely on oxygen. It should be noted that oxidative phosphorylation replenishes NAD + for glycolysis when oxygen is available, however, fermentation will replenish NAD + when oxygen is not available. Ultimately, without the presence of oxygen, aerobic respiration cannot proceed. Without aerobic respiration, aerobic organisms are not capable of surviving and will die off as a result. CC By 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. All living organisms require oxygen – This option is incorrect. Earth has a tremendous amount of biodiversity with many organisms utilizing different metabolic processes. For example, facultative anaerobes, obligate aerobes, and microaerophiles utilize oxygen for their metabolic needs; however, obligate anaerobes and aerotolerant organisms do NOT use oxygen for their energy needs. These organisms will either utilize anaerobic respiration or fermentation for their metabolic requirements. Option B. Glycolysis could not function without oxygen – This option is incorrect. Recall that glycolysis is the metabolic process by which a glucose molecule is broken down to yield a net of 2 pyruvate, 2 ATP, and 2 NADH. Glycolysis is the first step of cellular respiration and is a completely anaerobic process. This is because the NAD + that’s required for glycolysis to proceed can be resupplied via fermentation, an anaerobic process. In this way, glycolysis does not indirectly rely on oxidative phosphorylation (an aerobic process) to resupply NAD + ; therefore, glycolysis does NOT require oxygen. Option D. The breakdown of water requires oxygen – This option is incorrect. Recall that the photolysis of water is the first step of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. During the photolysis of water, photons from the sun will break down a water molecule into 2 protons (H + ), 2 electrons (e - ), and ½ atmospheric oxygen (O 2 ). This process does NOT occur during aerobic cellular respiration. During aerobic cellular respiration, oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor. Once the electrons have been passed along the electron transport chain during the oxidative phosphorylation step, those electrons (along with protons) will join oxygen (O 2 ) to become water. Because the breakdown of water does NOT occur during aerobic cellular respiration, this option is incorrect. Option E. Oxygen is required for fermentation – This option is incorrect. Recall that glycolysis requires NAD + in order to proceed. Under aerobic conditions (when oxygen is present), oxidative phosphorylation will regenerate the NAD + that’s required for pyruvate decarboxylation, the Krebs cycle, and glycolysis. However, under anaerobic conditions (when oxygen is not present), the pyruvate that’s produced from glycolysis will NOT go on to be decarboxylated but will instead, enter the fermentation pathway. There are two forms of fermentation, lactic acid fermentation and alcohol fermentation. Both types of fermentation will oxidize NADH into NAD + which can directly be used for glycolysis to continue making small amounts of ATP while oxygen is not available. It is crucial to remember that fermentation does NOT require oxygen.",

      "concept_text": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an automated molecular biology technique used to make millions of copies of a specified region of DNA. PCR utilizes DNA primers, Taq polymerase (a heat-resistant DNA polymerase), a thermal cycler, and a sample of the DNA that the researcher wishes to be amplified. The protocol for PCR requires the researcher to place the DNA sample, Taq polymerase, and DNA primers into a PCR tube. Once in the tube, the researcher will place the tube into the thermal cycler which, as the name suggests, will cycle through three different temperatures which can be associated with the three stages of the polymerase chain reaction: denaturation (~95° C), primer annealing (~65° C), and elongation (~70° C). Each cycle of denaturation, primer annealing, and elongation, the amount of double-stranded DNA segments will double. Therefore, after n cycles of PCR, the yield of DNA will be 2n copies. The first step of PCR is denaturation by which the heat from the thermal cycler will physically separate the DNA double helix into two single strands. The next step of PCR is primer annealing. Primer annealing is the hybridization of the forward and reverses primer to define the exact region of DNA to be replicated. The final step of PCR is elongation by which the Taq polymerase will add nucleotides to the 3’ end of each single-stranded DNA sequence. This finalizes one cycle of PCR. The sole purpose of PCR is to replicate a specified DNA sequence for study; therefore, Option A. DNA replication is the correct answer. CC By 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Detect specific DNA strands in a sample – This option is incorrect. Southern blotting is a molecular biological technique by which specific DNA segments can be detected within a sample of DNA. During a southern blot, the DNA is first ‘cut’ with restriction enzymes, resulting in smaller DNA fragments. These fragments can then be separated using gel electrophoresis. After being electrophoresed, the DNA fragments are then denatured (separated into single strands) and transferred to a membrane (much like during a western blot). After the transfer, the membrane will be exposed to a ‘DNA probe’ which is a sequence of single-stranded DNA that will hybridize to its complementary strand. The membrane is then image and the hybridized probe will be detected. This offers scientists an idea about the presence and size of the DNA segment of interest within the sample. Southern blotting is a separate biological technique from polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Option B. Study protein activity and motion through a cell – This option is incorrect. Pulse-chase experiments are used to how proteins move throughout the cell. During a pulse-chase experiment, radioactive, or fluorescent amino acids are briefly introduced into a solution in which a cell resides. That cell will take up these labelled amino acids to incorporate into their proteins, representing the pulse of radioactivity or fluorescence. Subsequent unlabeled amino acids are introduced as the chase. The motion of the labelled proteins would visually resemble a pulse as it moves around the cell which allows them to be tracked.  PCR is used at the nucleic acid level, not the protein level. Option D. Sequence genomes – This option is incorrect. Genome sequencing is a process that’s used to determine the complete DNA sequence of a particular organism’s genome. The two major forms of genome sequencing that you should know for your test are Sanger Sequencing and Next-Generation sequencing. Polymerase chain reaction is used to amplify a segment of DNA but it is not used to sequence a genome. Option E. Observe chromosomes during metaphase – This option is incorrect. The observation of chromosomes during metaphase describes a microscopic technique known as karyotyping. In metaphase, the chromosomes are condensed and lined up in the center of the cell. This makes them easily studied often for diagnostics purposes. A count of chromosomes can enable an operator to identify various chromosomal conditions, including aneuploidies.  Polymerase chain reaction involves the amplification of a segment of DNA, not the observation of chromosomes during metaphase.",

Once proteins have been synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, those proteins will enter the Golgi apparatus at the cis face (which faces the ER). Once in the Golgi, said proteins will be modified and packages based upon their destination (cell membrane, exocytosis, or some other area within the cell). One of the most common protein modifications is glycosylation, whereby a carbohydrate is added to the protein in order to convert that protein into a glycoprotein. Once the proteins have been modified and packaged, they will exit the Golgi at the trans face (which faces the plasma membrane) and travel to their destination. It is also important to note that the Golgi is involved in the synthesis of lysosomes, which are membrane-bound organelles that contain digestive enzymes that break down certain substances within the cell. For this question, it is crucial to be able to recognize certain organelles on an electron micrograph.

LH and  Estrogen – This option is incorrect . Recall that estrogen is the primary hormone that leads to the development of female sex characteristics, however, luteinizing hormone (LH) is primarily involved in ovulation. Recall that a spike in LH (secreted from the anterior pituitary) leads to the release of an egg from the Graafian follicle around day 14 of the menstrual cycle. It is important to remember that progesterone and estrogen will lead to the development of secondary sex characteristics, therefore, this option is incorrect. Option C. LH and  Progesterone – This option is incorrect . Recall that progesterone is involved in the development of female secondary sex characteristics, however, luteinizing hormone (LH) is not. Recall that a spike in LH (secreted from the anterior pituitary) leads to the release of an egg from the Graafian follicle around day 14 of the menstrual cycle. It is important to remember that progesterone and estrogen will lead to the development of secondary sex characteristics, therefore, this option is incorrect. Option D. FSH and  hCG – This option is incorrect . Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is secreted from the anterior pituitary and leads to the development of follicles during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. FSH doesn’t directly affect the development of female secondary sex characteristics. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCH) is secreted from the placenta after implantation of the blastocyst into the uterine wall. hCG is responsible for maintaining the corpus luteum, which continuously secretes estrogen and progesterone to maintain the thickness of the endometrium after implantation has occurred. hCG is not involved in the development of female secondary sex characteristics. It is important to remember that progesterone and estrogen will lead to the development of secondary sex characteristics, therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "Glycolysis is the first step of aerobic cellular respiration, and it occurs within the cytosol of the cell. It is also the only completely anaerobic step of aerobic cellular respiration. The first step of glycolysis is the phosphorylation of glucose via hexokinase and the hydrolysis of 1 ATP to yield glucose-6-phosphate . Once the first phosphorylation step has completed, glucose-6-phosphate will be converted to fructose-6-phosphate via isomerase. This fructose-6-phosphate will then undergo phosphorylation via phosphofructokinase (PFK) to yield fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. It should be known that this step is the rate-determining step of glycolysis and commits the glucose molecule to glycolysis. The mechanism of glycolysis that follows these steps is not important for your test, however, it is crucial to understand that the net products of glycolysis are 2 pyruvate , 2 NADH , and 2 ATP . Because pyruvate is one of the products of glycolysis, Option E . is the correct answer. CC By 4.0",

During glycolysis, once fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is formed, it will further breakdown into PGAL which will then undergo a series of redox reactions to ultimately form pyruvate, NADH, and ATP. Option B. H 2 O and CO 2 – This option is incorrect. Recall that glycolysis is the process by which one molecule of glucose gets broken down to yield a net of 2 pyruvate, 2 NADH, and 2 ATP. While CO 2 and H 2 O are products of aerobic cellular respiration as a whole, they are NOT products of glycolysis specifically. CO 2 gets produced during pyruvate decarboxylation and the Krebs cycle while water is produced during oxidative phosphorylation. Option C. G3P and CO 2 – This option is incorrect . Recall that glycolysis is the process by which one molecule of glucose gets broken down to yield a net of 2 pyruvate, 2 NADH, and 2 ATP. After fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is produced, it will further break down into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which is an intermediate formed before pyruvate gets produced. Therefore, G3P is an intermediate of glycolysis, NOT a product. Additionally, CO 2 is a product of pyruvate decarboxylation and the Krebs cycle, not glycolysis. Option D. Acetyl CoA – This option is incorrect. Acetyl CoA is one of the products of pyruvate decarboxylation, along with NADH and CO 2 . Pyruvate decarboxylation is the step the immediately follows glycolysis during aerobic cellular respiration. During pyruvate decarboxylation, the pyruvate that’s produced during glycolysis gets decarboxylated to yield Acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA is NOT a product of glycolysis.",

As with all macromolecules, DNA is composed of repeating subunits, known as monomers. The monomeric subunits of DNA are known as nucleotides . Recall that nucleotides are a pentose (5-carbon sugar) attached to a nitrogenous base and a single phosphate group. The primary purpose of DNA is to hold the genetic code that’s used as a blueprint to make proteins. First, the DNA strand must be transcribed into a messenger RNA (mRNA) strand. This process is known as DNA transcription . Next, that messenger RNA strand gets translated into a protein with the help of ribosomes! This process is known as translation . The crucial information that we need to understand in order to answer this question is simply that ribosomes do NOT bind to DNA, but rather, they bind to messenger RNA during protein translation. Ribosomes are unable to directly use DNA during protein translation. Instead, ribosomes will bind to an mRNA strand in order to read the strand and translate the corresponding polypeptide chain. Because ribosomes do NOT bind to DNA, it would not make sense for DNA to have a binding site for ribosomes. Therefore, Option A. is the correct answer to this question. CC BY 4.0",

Regardless, coding regions are an integral characteristic of DNA, therefore, this option is incorrect. Option C. A simple sequence repeat of nucleotides – This option is incorrect . Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are regions of DNA by which a sequence of nucleotides are repeated. The analysis of simple sequence repeats are used as a diagnostic tool for many diseases.

It’s worth noting that in eukaryotes, including humans, only a small percentage of a DNA strand will actually code for a protein. The segments that do not code for proteins are known as non-coding regions and while they may not directly code for a protein, often times, they serve a separate purpose. One example of this is seen in regulatory elements, such as promoters, enhancers, and silencers, which regulate gene expression. Another example of non-coding regions are introns, which are spliced out during mRNA processing. Because DNA strands possess non-coding regions, this option is incorrect.",

The answer to this question stems from the fact that despite having identical genetic information, cells of different type will exhibit differential gene expression and regulation. Nerve cells and skin cells have vastly different functions within an organism and therefore, will activate/suppress certain genes in order to fulfill their required function. In addition to gene expression, other factors such as alternative splicing and epigenetics can play a role in cell differentiation.

      "concept_text": "Before getting into the explanation for this question, it is important to first understand some general concepts that the question is asking about. The question asks about muscular dystrophy , an X-linked recessive disease. This means that the allele responsible for causing muscular dystrophy is present on the X chromosome. In addition, we know that muscular dystrophy is a recessive disease. This means that males, which possess one X and one Y chromosome, MUST possess the affected allele (X m ) on their only X chromosome in order for the muscular dystrophy phenotype to be expressed. Females, who possess two X chromosomes, MUST possess the affected allele (X m ) on BOTH of their X chromosomes. That is, females must be homozygous (X m X m ) in order to express the muscular dystrophy phenotype. First, consider the sex chromosomes that the son and daughter must have: XY and XX respectively. We know that each parent must contribute one of these chromosomes. Let’s look at their genotypes below. We know that son must get his Y chromosome from the father and the X chromosome must come from the mother. Because the son has an X-linked recessive disease, this must mean that the son received an affected X chromosome from the mother. For this to be the case, the mother must have at least one chromosome with the muscular dystrophy allele: X m X or X m X m (X m represents the affected chromosome for muscular dystrophy). Next, we know that the father has muscular dystrophy and so his genotype must be X m Y. We know that the daughter is normal. Recall that the daughter must get one X chromosome from the father and one from the mother. The father’s only X chromosome contains the muscular dystrophy allele so the daughter must have received this affected chromosome. However, because the daughter is normal, we know that her other X chromosome must be unaffected so her genotype must be X m X. The normal X chromosome must then come from the mother. From this, we see that the mother contributed an affected X chromosome to the son and an unaffected X chromosome to the daughter. Therefore, the mother’s genotype must be X m X. Therefore, Option C . X m X , is the correct answer. CC By 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. XmY – This option is incorrect . The question is asking us to determine the mother’s genotype. We know that females possess two X chromosomes, NOT one X and one Y chromosome. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option B. XY – This option is incorrect . The question is asking us to determine the mother’s genotype. We know that females possess two X chromosomes, NOT one X and one Y chromosome. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option D. XX – This option is incorrect . We know from the information provided that the son has muscular dystrophy. We know that the son inherited his X chromosome from his mother and therefore, the mother MUST possess at least one affected X chromosome. In other words, the mother must be a carrier for muscular dystrophy and possess at least one affected X chromosome (Xm). Option E. XmXm – This option is incorrect . Based on the information provided, the daughter does not express the muscular dystrophy phenotype. Because muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disease, this means that we know the daughter’s genotype cannot be XmXm. Because the father has muscular dystrophy, we know that the daughter is going to inherit his affected X chromosome. This means that the only possible genotype for the daughter is heterozygous (XXm). If we know that the daughter inherited an affected X chromosomes (Xm) from the father, she must have also inherited an unaffected X chromosome from the mother. This means that the mother cannot possess two affected X chromosomes (XmXm).",

      "poe_text": "Option B. O 2 is consumed – This option is incorrect .  Macromolecules are formed via dehydration synthesis reactions, also known as condensation reactions. During a condensation reaction, the hydroxyl group (OH) of one molecule and the hydrogen group (H) of another molecule will be removed and form water (H 2 O) as a byproduct. The result is a covalent bond being formed between the two previously separated molecules. Oxygen (O 2 ) is not consumed during a condensation reaction. Option C. H 2 O is consume d – This option is incorrect .  Macromolecules are formed via dehydration synthesis reactions, also known as condensation reactions. During a condensation reaction, the hydroxyl group (OH) of one molecule and the hydrogen group (H) of another molecule will be removed and form water (H 2 O) as a byproduct. The result is a covalent bond being formed between the two previously separated molecules. A hydrolysis reaction is the opposite of a condensation reaction by which a water molecule (H 2 O) is incorporated/consumed in order to break a covalent bond. Because H 2 O is consumed during a hydrolysis reaction which breaks monomeric subunits apart, this option is incorrect. Option D. ATP is formed – This option is incorrect .  Condensation reactions are anabolic reactions that build large macromolecules from smaller monomeric subunits. Because condensation reactions are anabolic, they require ATP as an energy source in order to proceed. ATP is consumed, not formed during a condensation reaction. Option E. O 2 is formed – This option is incorrect .  Macromolecules are formed via dehydration synthesis reactions, also known as condensation reactions. During a condensation reaction, the hydroxyl group (OH) of one molecule and the hydrogen group (H) of another molecule will be removed and form water (H 2 O) as a byproduct. The result is a covalent bond being formed between the two previously separated molecules. Condensation reactions form H 2 O as a byproduct, NOT atmospheric oxygen, therefore this option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "The function of a certain protein is determined by its structure . The structure of proteins can be broken down into four different levels: the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. The primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain where amino acids are joined together via peptide bonds. The secondary structure takes the form of either an alpha helix or a beta pleated sheet. These structures form due to hydrogen bonding between the amino (NH2) and carboxyl (COOH) groups of amino acids in the proximity. The tertiary structure results from interactions between the various R groups of the amino acids within the polypeptide chain. The interactions between these R groups can be hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect, disulfide bonding (covalent bonding between cysteines), and Van Der Waals forces. And lastly, the quaternary structure consists of interactions between 2 or more polypeptide chains to create a protein complex. For example, hemoglobin contains four polypeptide chains in its total protein structure. All functioning proteins consist of a primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. Only some proteins contain a quaternary structure. Recall that in order for a protein to be synthesized, DNA must first be transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA will then be used as a template by the ribosome in order to link the corresponding amino acids into the correct sequence to make a polypeptide chain. This means that the primary sequence of a protein is a direct result of the messenger RNA (mRNA) code. Because the primary sequence is a result of the mRNA sequence and the tertiary structure is a result of R-group interactions between amino acids, Option E. is the correct answer. CC By 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. tRNA structure; hydrogen bonding – This option is incorrect .  tRNA molecules are specialized RNA that transport amino acids to the ribosome in order to be assembled into a protein. tRNA structure doesn’t play a role in the primary structure of a protein. Hydrogen bonding is involved in both the secondary and tertiary structure of so the reason that this answer choice is incorrect is because the structure of tRNA does not determine the primary structure of a protein. Option B. Hydrogen bonding: peptide bonds – This option is incorrect .  Hydrogen bonding takes part in the formation of the secondary and tertiary structure, not the primary structure of a protein. Recall that peptide bonds are the bonds that link adjacent amino acids together in order to create a polypeptide chain. This means that peptide bonds contribute to the primary structure, not the tertiary structure. Option C . Interactions of R-groups; glycosidic linkages – This option is incorrect .  Interactions of R-groups, such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect, disulfide bonding (covalent bonding between cysteines), and Van Der Waals forces, are responsible for the formation of the tertiary structure of a protein, not the primary structure. In addition, glycosidic linkages are important for the polymerization of carbohydrates, not proteins. Option D. Structure of side chains; disulfide bonds – This option is incorrect .  The structure of side chains (R-groups) are important for the interactions that are possible between various side chains of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. This means that the structure of side chains contributes to the secondary and tertiary structure of a protein, not the primary structure. In addition, disulfide bonds are bonds between the sulfur atoms of two cysteine amino acids. Disulfide bonding does in fact contribute to the tertiary structure of a protein. Therefore, the reason that this answer choice is incorrect is due to the fact that the structure of amino acid side chains does not contribute to the primary structure.",

      "concept_text": "The ploidy describes the number of sets of chromosomes in a cell. Haploid refers to a single set of chromosomes (N) while diploid refers to two sets of chromosomes (2N). In a diploid organism, the two sets of chromosomes are homologous to each other. One set of chromosomes comes from the mother and the other set of chromosomes comes from the father. When a sexually reproducing diploid organism (2N) produces gametes, these gametes are haploid (N). During sexual reproduction, the haploid gametes fuse to achieve the diploid configuration of the organism. This combination of haploid gametes to form a diploid zygote achieves genetic diversity since there are two alleles of each gene,  one from each homologous chromosome. In many species, hybrid offspring between two different species' is not possible. There are both prezygotic and postzygotic isolation mechanisms in place within nature to prevent the formation of a hybrid. However, some species, such as the tiger and lion, have homologous sets of chromosomes despite having a different number of chromosomes. This is what enables them to give birth to the liger offspring, as shown in the image below. Recall that a diploid offspring in a sexually reproducing species is formed by the fusion of haploid gametes. We are given the ploidy (diploid here) and chromosome count for both the tiger and lion. Since the haploid gametes are formed by meiosis, they must have half the chromosome count of the somatic cells. The tiger gametes must have 20 chromosomes while the lion gametes must have 19 chromosomes. The fusion of male and female gametes from these species will result in a diploid zygote with a total of 39 chromosomes (20 + 19). Therefore, Option B . 2N = 39 , is the correct answer.",

      "concept_text": "For this question, it is important that you understand the structure of a chloroplast. Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis, which is the utilization of photons from the sun in order to create glucose for energy. Likely having an endosymbiotic origin like the mitochondria, chloroplasts have a double membrane: an inner and outer membrane separated by an intermembrane space. Further inside is the stroma , the fluid that surrounds the thylakoids inside the chloroplasts. Grana refers to stacks of thylakoids . This structure is shown below. CC By 4.0 Recall that the electron transport chain is the major component of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. While this question simply asks for the location of the electron transport chain, let’s briefly summarize the light-dependent reactions. The goal of this set of reactions is to produce ATP and NADPH to drive the Calvin Cycle’s synthesis of glucose. The light-dependent reactions that produce these molecules occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. This set of reactions uses the energy from photons to energize electrons so that they move through the electron transport chain to generate an electrochemical gradient. This gradient of protons is used to generate ATP via chemiosmosis while the resulting high-energy electrons at the end of the electron transport chain are used to reduce the electron carrier s NADP to NADPH. It is important to note that the ATP produced from the light-dependent reactions is not used to power the cell. It is only used in the Calvin cycle in order to synthesize glucose. The electrons that flow through the electron transport chain are replenished by the hydrolysis of H 2 O to O 2 , which releases electrons into the chain and protons into the thylakoid lumen. Together, all of the ATP and NADPH produced from the light-dependent reactions are used to drive the light-independent reactions of the Calvin Cycle to synthesize glucose from CO 2 . This process is summarized in the graphic below. Do not forget that plant cells still have mitochondria for ATP production from carbohydrates. Because the electron transport chain takes place in the thylakoid membrane, Option E . is the correct answer. CC By 4.0",

Thylakoid Lumen – This option is incorrect . The electron transport chain involves multiple transmembrane proteins and is found in the thylakoid membrane. While it is true that the electron transport chain is responsible for pumping protons from the stroma into the lumen of the thylakoid, to say that the electron transport chain is found in the lumen would be incorrect. Option C. Stroma – This option is incorrect . The electron transport chain involves multiple transmembrane proteins and is found in the thylakoid membrane.

It is important to memorize this table for the Canadian DAT. CC By 4.0 Recall that bacteria can be classified as either gram-positive or gram-negative. What constitutes a bacterium’s classification is based upon how well that particular bacterium is able to absorb a gram stain. Gram-positive bacteria will stain dark purple, whereas gram-negative bacteria will stain a lighter pink (due to the counterstain). What we notice from the chart above is that gram-negative bacteria are known for producing endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), which is found within the outer membrane of the bacteria. Knowing that gram-positive bacteria do NOT produce endotoxin, we can confirm that the bacteria in question are gram-negative. From there, we simply need to determine which answer choice provides a statement that is true of this gram-negative bacterium. We notice from the chart that gram-negative bacteria are also equipped with a second, outer membrane (this is where the endotoxin is found and release when the membrane is destroyed). Based on this information, we know that Option C . is the correct answer. CC By 4.0",

Only gram-negative bacteria produce endotoxin which is embedded within the outer membrane. Because exotoxin is produced by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, this option is incorrect. Option B. Contains a thick peptidoglycan cell wall – This option is incorrect . Recall that gram-positive bacteria stain dark purple due to their thick peptidoglycan cell wall. Both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria contain peptidoglycan in their cell wall, however, the layer of peptidoglycan is much thicker in gram-positive bacteria. We know that the bacteria in question are gram-negative bacteria because they produce endotoxin. Gram-negative bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan layer, NOT a thick peptidoglycan layer. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option D. Stain dark purple – This option is incorrect . Recall that the gram stain is a biological technique that’s used to differentiate gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria based upon how much of the stain is absorbed. It is important to remember that gram-positive bacteria stain dark purple due to their thick peptidoglycan cell wall. Gram-negative bacteria stain light pink because they have a much thinner layer of peptidoglycan in their cell wall (the light pink color is a result of the counter stain). We know that the bacteria in question are gram-negative bacteria because they produce endotoxin. Therefore, the bacteria in question would stain light pink, NOT dark purple. Option E. Contain teichoic acids – This option is incorrect . Teichoic acids are acids found covalently attached to the peptidoglycan layer of gram-positive bacteria only. Teichoic acids are used as recognition and binding sites by bacterial viruses. The also provide the cell wall with rigidity.

      "concept_text": "Nondisjunction is the failure of one or more pairs of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids to separate normally during nuclear division. It can occur either during meiosis I (anaphase I) or meiosis II (anaphase II). Recall that meiosis is the process by which a diploid parent cell will divide into four haploid daughter cells. In this case, the four daughter cells are gametes.  Since meiosis consists of two anaphase events, a nondisjunction event could take place in either meiosis I or meiosis II. Karyotyping is an imaging technique used to visualize a complete set of chromosomes within the cells of an organism. Karyotyping is useful because it reveals both the physical appearance and number of chromosomes. This technique is commonly used to diagnose genetic diseases such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome. All of these diseases are directly caused from a nondisjunction event during meiosis. Karyotyping is performed while the cell is in metaphase of mitosis. The image below shows what a trisomy (one extra chromosome) at chromosome 21 looks like using a karyotype. Because karyotyping is used to identify a nondisjunction, Option B . is the correct answer. CC By 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. DNA microarray – This option is incorrect because DNA microarrays are used to study gene expression. Here, mRNA is converted to complementary DNA or cDNA. Then this cDNA is washed over a microarray with various DNA probes with genes of interest. If cDNA associated with certain genes are present, they will be hybridized with the associated probe. In this manner, we can study what genes are being expressed based on what mRNA is present in a cell.  This technique is not used for the observation of chromosomes and would not be suitable to identify a nondisjunction. Option C. Hemocytometer – This option is incorrect because a hemocytometer is a microscope slide with engraved grid lines used to count blood cells. It is not useful for observing chromosomes. Option D. Scanning electron microscope – This option is incorrect. Scanning electron microscopes utilized a beam of electrons that will ‘scan’ the surface of a sample. An image can be generated based upon the interaction of atoms in the sample and the electrons from the beam. Scanning electron microscopes produce high resolution, 3D images of samples. Karyotyping utilizes light microscopes as opposed to electron microscopes. Option E. Stereo microscope – This option is incorrect. A stereo microscope, also known as a dissecting microscope, is a microscope that’s designed for 3D viewing of relatively large specimens. The specimens that are visualized in a stereo microscope are much larger than chromosomes, which are typically visualized by light microscopes for karyotyping. Stereo microscopes simply do not offer the amount of magnification that’s required to visualize chromosomes; therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "Meiosis is the cellular division process by which a parent cell will divide to form 4 genetically unique haploid daughter cells. Meiosis occurs in germ cells in order to produce gametes. Meiosis occurs in two phases: Meiosis I and Meiosis II can each be broken down further into subphases: Recall that during the synthesis (S) phase of interphase, the cell’s genetic material is replicated in preparation for cell division. The replicated chromosomes are attached to each other at the centromere. At this point, they are known as sister chromatids. When two sister chromatids are attached at a centromere, it is known as a dyad . During Prophase I (prophase of meiosis I), homologous dyads will synapse with each other to form what’s known as a tetrad . An image of a tetrad is shown below: CC By 4.0 The synapsis of homologous chromosomes allows for the crossing over of genetic material. The point of contact where crossing over occurs is known as the chiasma . This is one method by which meiosis is able to increase genetic diversity. Because crossing over occurs during prophase I, Option A . is the correct answer to this question. The image below depicts the process of crossing over: CC By 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Immediately after replication of chromosomes – Telophase I – This option is incorrect . Recall that the replication of chromosomes occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle, which occurs during interphase, not during meiosis. Recall that Gap Phase 2 of interphase occurs immediately after S phase. Telophase I occurs after anaphase I. Telophase I is the phase by which the meiotic spindle disappears, the nuclear membrane develops, and each pole forms a new nucleus with a haploid number of chromosomes. Crossing over occurs during Prophase I, not Telophase I. Additionally, Telophase I is not the stage that immediately follows the replication of chromosomes. Option B. Before nuclear envelope disintegrates – Anaphase II – This option is incorrect . Recall that the nuclear envelope disintegrates during Prophase I (and Prophase II) of meiosis. We also know that crossing over occurs during Prophase I. Because both of these processes occur during Prophase I, it would not make sense that crossing over occurs before the nuclear envelope disintegrates. Additionally, the nuclear envelope does not disintegrate during Anaphase II. Recall that during anaphase II, the identical sister chromatids are separated and migrate to opposite poles of the cell. Once the chromatids have been separated, they are now considered individual chromosomes. Option D. Before condensation of chromosomes – Prophase II – This option is incorrect . Recall that prophase II is the phase by which the nuclear envelope breaks down, nucleoli will disappear, and chromatin condenses into chromosomes. However, synapsis and crossing over does NOT occur during prophase II. Option E. Before the tetrads are formed – Anaphase I – This option is incorrect . Recall that during Prophase I, the nuclear envelope breaks down, nucleoli will disappear, chromatin condenses into chromosomes, and homologous dyads have synapsed with each other to form tetrads. Crossing over occurs between the two homologous dyads of a tetrad, therefore, crossing over occurs during Prophase I. Additionally, tetrads are not formed during Anaphase I. In fact, Anaphase I is the phase by which the homologous dyads of a tetrad are separated and migrate to opposite poles of the cell.",

      "concept_text": "Recall that the exchange of nutrients between target tissues and the circulatory system occurs throughout the body at capillary beds. During the process of secretion and reabsorption at the capillary bed, some of the interstitial fluid doesn’t get reabsorbed back into circulation and will therefore, enter lymphatic vessels. Once the fluid has entered lymphatic vessels, it is termed lymph . Lymph will eventually return to venous circulation but before it does, it will be filtered by lymph nodes . Lymph nodes are structures of the lymphatic system that contain immune cells that will help remove pathogens within the lymph. This is why lymph nodes will swell when we are sick. Examining lymph nodes is a diagnostic tool that helps determine the spread of diseases/pathogens throughout the body. In the scenario in question, we can see that a patient with colon cancer undergoes a procedure in order to have a lymph node examined. This procedure is known as a lymph node biopsy, and it’s used to determine if the cancer has metastasized. That is, see if the cancer has spread from the colon to other systems/tissues of the body. Lymph node biopsies are extremely helpful in determine the staging of the cancer.

Lymphedema refers to an accumulation of lymph volume which leads to swelling. Lymphedema is associated with a compromised lymphatic system, leading to a disruption of proper lymph flow/drainage. While lymphedema can be an unwanted consequence from the removal of lymph nodes, testing for lymphedema would never be the purpose for lymph node removal. Option C. Test for cancerous red blood cells within lymph – This option is incorrect. Lymph is a term given to the fluid found in lymphatic vessels that were not reabsorbed into vascular circulation within a capillary bed. While lymph contains an abundance of white blood cells, red blood cells are NOT found within lymph. For this reason, the biopsy of lymph nodes would not be for the purpose of red blood cell analysis. Option E. Sample cancerous DNA – This option is incorrect. While it is true that examining the genetic information of cancerous cells is an important aspect for the research of cancer, this would not be the purpose of a lymph node biopsy in the context of this question.

      "concept_text": "For this question, it’s easiest if we identify the organism in test tube A first and then move on to test tube B. Based on the information provided, test tube A contains a eukaryotic organism that is capable of sexual reproduction . Recall that sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction by which male and female gametes fuse, resulting in the formation of a zygote (fertilization). This is typically accomplished by the contributions of two distinct parent organisms, but there are exceptions (such as self-fertilization that’s exhibited in certain plants). We also know that the organisms in both test tube A and B are autotrophic . Recall that autotrophs are organisms that are capable of producing their own energy. That is, they do not rely on the consumption of other organisms for their energetic needs. Photosynthesis is the most common autotrophic process on Earth. Knowing that the organism in test tube A is an autotrophic eukaryote that’s capable of sexual reproduction should indicate that this organism is a plant. Recall that Plantae is a kingdom found in the domain Eukarya. Plants are also capable of alternation of generations by which they alternate between diploid and haploid stages. In this way, plants are capable of both sexual AND asexual reproduction. Now moving on to test tube B. We know that the organism in test tube B is autotrophic. We also know that the organism in test tube B is a prokaryote that closely resembles a chloroplast . Recall that a chloroplast is an organelle that’s found within photosynthetic organisms. Chloroplasts contain special pigments, like chlorophyll, that can absorb energy from the sun’s light. This energy is harnessed and used to produce glucose via photosynthesis. Understanding that this organism is an autotrophic prokaryote that closely resembles a chloroplast should heavily indicate that this organism is a cyanobacterium . Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are photosynthetic organisms that do NOT contain chloroplasts. Instead, these organisms closely resemble chloroplasts and are capable of photosynthesis. In fact, cyanobacteria are often recognized for increasing the atmospheric oxygen levels on Earth so that aerobic organisms could emerge! Because the organism in test tube A is a plant and the organism in test tube B is a cyanobacterium, Option C. is the correct answer to this question.",

Additionally, Fungi are eukaryotic, not prokaryotic. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option B. Archaea, Plant– This option is incorrect .  Archaea are one of the 3 taxonomic domains for which you need to know for your exam. The other two are Eubacteria and Eukarya. The easiest way to eliminate this answer choice is by understanding the Archaea are prokaryotic, NOT eukaryotic. Additionally, plants are eukaryotic, not prokaryotic. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option D. Animalia, Protist – This option is incorrect .  The kingdom animalia belongs to the domain Eukarya. Animals are capable of sexual reproduction, however, all organisms found in the kingdom Animalia are heterotrophic, NOT autotrophic. Additionally, protists are single-celled eukaryotic organisms, NOT prokaryotes. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option E. Protozoa, Sponge – This option is incorrect .  Protozoans are animal-like protists that belong to the domain Eukarya. Because protozoa are eukaryotic, they possess membrane-bound organelles. Protozoans are mobile due to the presence of cilia/flagella and are therefore, heterotrophic. Protozoans are NOT autotrophic. Additionally, sponges belong to the phylum Porifera. Porifera belongs to the kingdom Animalia and are therefore, eukaryotic, NOT prokaryotic. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

The sliding of myofilaments shortens the sarcomere and stimulates muscular contraction! Let’s briefly look at the mechanisms behind the sliding filament theory. The sliding filament theory begins when a presynaptic motor neuron delivers its action potential to the postsynaptic muscle fiber. In order to do this, the presynaptic motor neuron will synapse with the postsynaptic muscle fiber and release acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular junction is the space between the neuromuscular motor neuron and the postsynaptic muscle fiber. This acetylcholine will lead to sodium channels on the post-synaptic muscle fiber to open. This leads to an influx of sodium ions which will depolarize the cell and lead to the firing of an action potential. Once the action potential has been initiated, the action potential will travel along the T-tubules until it meets the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Once the depolarization reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum, it will lead to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels. This calcium will be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and will bind to troponin, causing troponin to remove tropomyosin from the binding site on actin. Once the binding sites on actin are exposed, the myosin heads are able to bind to the actin and pull it towards the center of the sarcomere, stimulating muscle contraction! While acetylcholine may be an enticing answer choice, we must remember that acetylcholine is a presynaptic neurotransmitter that will bind to receptors that are found on the postsynaptic skeletal muscle cell. Acetylcholine will NOT be found in elevated levels within the cytosol of the postsynaptic skeletal muscle cell. Acetylcholine is instead used to transfer an action potential from the presynaptic cell to the postsynaptic cell. Once the action potential has been transferred, it is the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum that will lead to muscular contraction. Therefore, calcium will be found in elevated levels within the cytosol of the postsynaptic cell. Because of this, Option C . is the correct answer to this question. CC By 4.0 - Modified",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Acetylcholine – This option is incorrect .  While acetylcholine may be an enticing answer choice, we must remember that acetylcholine is a presynaptic neurotransmitter that will bind to receptors that are found on the postsynaptic skeletal muscle cell – they do not enter the postsynaptic cell. Acetylcholine will NOT be found in elevated levels within the cytosol of the postsynaptic skeletal muscle cell. Acetylcholine is instead used to transfer an action potential from the presynaptic cell to the postsynaptic cell. Once the action potential has been transferred, it is the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum that will lead to muscular contraction. Option B. Phosphate– This option is incorrect. While phosphate may be indirectly involved in skeletal muscle contractions (hydrolysis of ATP to release inorganic phosphate), the hydrolysis of ATP occurs after the cross-bridge has been formed. Because of this, phosphate is not used to initiate skeletal muscle contraction, necessarily. The release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum precedes the formation of the crossbridge. In this way, it is actually the release of calcium (which will lead to elevated levels in the cytosol) that initiates skeletal muscle contraction. Option D. Bicarbonate – This option is incorrect. Bicarbonate is an integral anion for the bicarbonate buffering system. Recall that this system involves carbonic anhydrase which is an enzyme that will convert carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O) into carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ). This carbonic acid will then dissociate into bicarbonate (HCO 3 - ) and a proton (H + ). The bicarbonate buffering system is how our bodies are able to maintain stable and neutral pH within the blood. Bicarbonate is not used during skeletal muscle contraction. Option E. Troponin – This option is incorrect. Recall that in order for muscle to contract, myosin heads must bind to actin and pull the actin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere, shortening the sarcomere as a whole. In the relaxed state, tropomyosin is blocking the binding sites on actin. It is the role of troponin to move the tropomyosin and expose the binding sites so the myosin heads can bind to actin. Troponin will facilitate this when calcium binds to troponin. While troponin plays a role in skeletal muscle contraction, troponin levels will remain relatively stable in the postsynaptic cell, therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "Associative learning involves animals recognizing that different events or stimuli are connected. Non-associative learning includes habituation and sensitization and involves changes in behavior due to stimuli. They are non-associative because they only involve one stimulus with no direct link to another stimulus or consequence that would lead to a change in behavior. Habituation describes a form of learned behavior that allows an animal to disregard meaningless stimuli. This helps the animal avoid wasting energy on useless responses. An example of habituation is observed in dogs when they move from a rural area to the middle of the city. The city is loud with construction and honking cars which can cause the dog to be anxious and on edge. However, over time, the dog will learn that the loud noises are not associated with any danger and will therefore stop responding to the stimuli. In the scenario in question, we see that when the owner comes home and slams the door, the pet cat gets frightened. Over time, the cat doesn’t associate the door slamming with any form of danger and will therefore, stop responding to this stimulus. Therefore, Option A. Habituation, is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Conditioned stimulus – This option is incorrect. Classical conditioning is a learning process by which a neutral stimulus (a stimulus that does not invoke a response) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (a stimulus that invokes an unconditioned response). When this pairing occurs, the unconditioned response becomes associated with the neutral stimulus. Over time, the neutral stimulus will be able to invoke the unconditioned response. It is at this point when the neutral stimulus becomes the conditioned stimulus. The most common example of classical conditioning is seen with Pavlov’s dogs. The scenario in question has nothing to do with classical conditioning. Option C. Conditioned response– This option is incorrect. Classical conditioning is a learning process by which a neutral stimulus (a stimulus that does not invoke a response) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (a stimulus that invokes an unconditioned response).

It is at this point when the neutral stimulus becomes the conditioned stimulus. The most common example of classical conditioning is seen with Pavlov’s dogs. The scenario in question has nothing to do with classical conditioning. Option D. Stimulus discrimination – This option is incorrect because stimulus discrimination is a concept by which a learning organism can differentially respond to slightly different stimuli. The situation above does not involve  stimulus discrimination. Option E. Spontaneous Recovery – This option is incorrect. Extinction is a process by which a learned behavior is forgotten over time when reinforcement is not offered. Let’s use Pavlov’s dogs as an example. After Pavlov had conditioned the dogs to salivate at the sound of the bell, he stopped presenting food when he rang the bell. This led to the extinction of the salivation response. If Pavlov were to then stop ringing the bell all together during a ‘rest period’ and then reintroducing the bell after some time, the dogs might spontaneously recover the salivating response even though it had previously been extinct. The scenario in question does not involve spontaneous recovery.",

      "concept_text": "Epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) are water-soluble hormones that are produced from the adrenal medulla. Recall that the autonomic nervous system can be broken down into the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is activated during times of stress and is involved in our “fight or flight” response. The parasympathetic nervous system is activated when the body is at rest and is involved in the “rest and digest” response. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are involved in the sympathetic response. Therefore, epinephrine and norepinephrine will be secreted when the body is exposed to a stressful situation. For example, if you were on a hike in the woods and stumbled upon a bear, your fight or flight response would kick in so you could either run from or fight off the bear. The sympathetic response involves an increase in heart rate, dilation of the bronchi, dilation of the pupils, dilation of blood vessels to the skeletal muscles, etc. During the sympathetic response, the body needs to allocate resources to the areas of the body that need it most. This is why the sympathetic response involves dilation of blood vessels leading to the heart, lungs and skeletal muscles. Since the skin, mucus membranes, and kidney do not need as much blood when the body is in fight or flight mode, a constriction of blood flow will be observed to those areas. Because epinephrine and norepinephrine are involved in the dilation of blood vessels to the heart, lungs, and skeletal muscle with a constriction of blood flow to the skin, mucus membranes, and kidney, Option B. is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Glucagon – This option is incorrect .  Glucagon is a peptide hormone that’s synthesized by alpha cells of the pancreas. Glucagon is secreted during times of fasting and circulating glucose levels are low. When glucagon is released, it will stimulate the breakdown of glycogen into glucose (glycogenolysis) in the liver which can then be released into the bloodstream. Additionally, the release of glucagon will stimulate the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors (gluconeogenesis). Ultimately, glucagon functions to increase circulating glucose levels. Glucagon does NOT function to dilate blood vessels to the heart, lungs, and skeletal muscle while constricting blood flow to the skin, mucus membranes, and kidney. Option C. Acetylcholine – This option is incorrect .  Acetylcholine is a pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system. It should also be known that acetylcholine is ONLY a pre-ganglionic neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system. Acetylcholine is also released from a pre-synaptic neuron into the neuromuscular junction in order to stimulate muscular contractions. Epinephrine is the post-ganglionic neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system that’s responsible for the dilation of blood vessels to the heart, lungs, and skeletal muscle and the constriction of blood flow to the skin, mucus membranes, and kidney. Option D. Cortisol – This option is incorrect .  Cortisol is a steroid hormone that’s secreted from the adrenal cortex. Cortisol is secreted during periods of long-term stress. The effects of cortisol include gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors), suppression of the immune system, and the break-down of proteins and fats for fuel. Cortisol is not involved in the dilation of blood vessels to the heart, lungs, and skeletal muscle and the constriction of blood flow to the skin, mucus membranes, and kidney. Option E. Nitric oxide – This option is incorrect .  Nitric oxide is both a gas and a neurotransmitter. Nitric oxide is synthesized from various cells within the body and has multiple effects. The main effect that you should know for your exam is that nitric oxide is a smooth muscle relaxer. Recall that arteries possess smooth muscles that help with blood flow and the regulation of blood pressure. The relaxation of these smooth muscles as a result of nitric oxide will dilate the blood vessels and decrease blood pressure. While nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator, it does not play a direct role in the sympathetic nervous system. Nitric oxide will not constrict blood flow to the skin, mucus membranes, and the kidney, therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "All triploblastic organisms (organisms that possess all three germ layers) can be classified as either protostomes or deuterostomes . The terms ‘protostome’ and ‘deuterostome’ are used to describe certain processes that organisms undergo during embryonic development. Let’s examine these processes and how we can distinguish between protostomes and deuterostomes. As stated previously, all triploblastic organisms can be classified as protostomes or deuterostomes. All triploblastic phyla, aside from Echinodermata and Chordata, are protostomes. Protostomes exhibit spiral and mosaic (determinate) cleavage. Spiral cleavage means that the cells of the developing embryo are slightly off-center to each other in the vertical axis. That is, they form more of a spiral as opposed to the cells being lined up directly on top of one another (like a spiral staircase). Mosaic cleavage means that blastomeres are unable to develop into a complete embryo if they are separated. This is due This is in contrast to regulative (indeterminate) cleavage by which separated blastomeres ARE able to complete full development. In protostomes, the blastopore (an opening created by the invagination of the primitive streak) will develop into the mouth. Deuterostomes undergo radial and regulative (indeterminant) cleavage . Radial cleavage means that the cells (blastomeres) of a developing embryo are aligned with each other in the vertical axis. That is, each ‘row’ of cells is developing directly on top of the ‘row’ of cells below. In deuterostomes, the blastopore becomes the anus. Recall that humans are deuterostomes! For this question, we simply need to understand that the blastomeres of an embryo undergoing regulative (indeterminate) cleavage can split off and undergo full development into a separate, viable organism. If a 2 cell embryo is undergoing regulative cleavage and the cells separate, both cells will complete full development into 2 normal, viable organisms. Therefore, Option A. is the correct answer to this question. CC By 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. 2 abnormal, nonviable organisms – This option is incorrect .  Recall that deuterostomes undergo radial and regulative cleavage. Regulative cleavage, also known as indeterminate cleavage, means that the blastomeres of the developing embryo can split off and undergo full development into their own separate, viable organism. If the cells (blastomeres) of a 2 cell embryo were to split, both cells would be able to undergo full development into 2 normal, viable organisms. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option C. 1 normal viable and 1 abnormal nonviable organism – This option is incorrect .  Recall that deuterostomes undergo radial and regulative cleavage.

      "concept_text": "In order to answer this question, we must first understand the process of gastrulation . Gastrulation describes the process by which three embryonic germ layers arise from the primitive streak. The primitive streak is a structure formed by the epiblast that will eventually invaginate and form the three embryonic germ layers. These three germ layers are listed from superficial to deep as follows: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Each of the three germ layers will differentiate and develop into various structures and systems of the body. The ectoderm will differentiate to form the nervous system (brain and spinal cord), integument (epidermis, hair, epithelium of the nose, mouth, and anal canal), sensory structures of the eyes, ears, and nose, as well as the adrenal medulla. Neural crest cells of the ectoderm will also form the teeth, jaws, and bones of the skull. The mesoderm will give rise to the musculoskeletal system, the circulatory system, the excretory system, the gonads, portions of the digestive and respiratory system, the notochord, the kidney, the dermis of the skin, and the adrenal cortex.

The neural plate will then fold, forming the neural fold or neural groove. This neural fold will continue to fold until it forms a hollow tube.
