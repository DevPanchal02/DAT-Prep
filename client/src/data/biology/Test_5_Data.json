    "explanation": {
      "concept_text": "The central dogma of genetics states that DNA is transcribed to RNA and then RNA is translated into proteins. Prokaryotic translation simultaneously occurs as the mRNA is being transcribed because there is no nuclear membrane, and the cell lacks compartmentalization. On the other hand, eukaryotes have a membrane-bound nucleus, thus separating the transcription and translation stages. One of the ways cells ensure that mRNA is protected and successfully shuttled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is with a series of post-transcriptional modifications. Generally speaking, prokaryotes do not perform post-transcriptional modifications such as the addition of a 5' cap or a polyA (polyadenylation) tail to their RNA transcript. Furthermore, prokaryotes do not contain introns in their mRNA. In contrast, eukaryotic pre-mRNA must undergo several modifications before leaving the nucleus. To stabilize their mRNA, eukaryotes add a 5' GTP cap and also perform polyadenylation to add a series of adenine nucleotides to the end of the RNA transcript. As such, Option C , Polyadenylation of RNA , is the correct answer. Furthermore, splicing is an mRNA processing event unique to eukaryotes and their subsequent gene expression. Splicing is a process in which spliceosome molecules remove introns (non-coding segments) from pre-mRNA and splice the exons together (coding segments), resulting in an mRNA that is ready to leave the nucleus – visualized below. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Presence of a promoter region – This option is incorrect because promoter regions for transcription are present in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. A promoter region is a sequence of DNA that is usually upstream (before) a gene and helps attract RNA polymerases to attach to the correct DNA location for transcription. In eukaryotes, the promotor region is known as the TATA box, and in prokaryotes, it is known as the Pribnow box (think P for P, Prokaryote - Pribnow). The promoter region is not transcribed – you can think of it as a landing site for the RNA polymerase. Since promoter regions are found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, this option is incorrect. Option B. Use of RNA polymerase – This option is incorrect because both prokaryotes and eukaryotes use RNA polymerase. This enzyme is responsible for the transcription of DNA to RNA by using a three-step process: 1) initiation, 2) elongation, and 3) termination. During initiation, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region of DNA and the double helix begins unwinding. During elongation, RNA polymerase reads the template DNA strand in the 3’→5’ and uses complementary base-pairing to synthesize a strand in the 5’→3’ direction (note that reading and synthesizing are performed in opposite directions). Termination occurs once the RNA polymerase reaches a terminator sequence, which triggers the enzyme to stop transcribing and detach from the completed RNA strand. Option D. Presence of nucleotides – This option is incorrect because nucleotides are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Recall that nucleotides are the monomers of nucleic acids — therefore, by definition, any nucleic acid will be composed of nucleotides.  Nucleotides are made up of a nitrogenous base (e.g. adenine and guanine), a pentose sugar (ribose in RNA and deoxyribose in DNA), and a phosphate group. Numerous nucleotides on the same strand link to each other via phosphodiester bonds that connect the phosphate group of one nucleotide with the sugar of the other — hence the term sugar-phosphate backbone. Since nucleotides are found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, this option is incorrect. Option E. Simultaneous transcription and translation – This option is incorrect because simultaneous transcription and translation is a characteristic unique to prokaryotes, NOT eukaryotes. Recall that one of the defining features of prokaryotes is the lack of membrane-bound organelles. Since there is no membrane-bound nucleus, prokaryotic DNA freely floats in a region of the cytoplasm known as the nucleoid. This lack of compartmentalization means there is no physical barrier separating transcription and translation—like there is in eukaryotic cells. Instead, prokaryotic translation can occur simultaneously as RNA strands are being transcribed, since ribosomes can immediately attach to the RNA rather than waiting for it to first be exported from a nucleus. This option is incorrect because simultaneous transcription and translation is a characteristic unique to prokaryotes, not eukaryotes, as the option suggests.",

      "concept_text": "Follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) is a tropic hormone (targets other endocrine glands) and is released by the anterior pituitary gland when stimulated by the hypothalamus. In males, FSH stimulates the Sertoli cells to promote the maturation of seminiferous tubules and spermatogenesis (production of male gametes); spermatogenesis would fail to occur if FSH was unavailable. Therefore, Option A , FSH , is the correct answer. Below is a figure depicting the male reproductive cycle and its feedback loops. Note that FSH directly stimulates Sertoli cells, facilitating spermatogenesis, while luteinizing hormone (LH) directly stimulates the Leydig cells to produce testosterone, which, in turn, helps to promote spermatogenesis. Furthermore, note that an increase in Sertoli and Leydig cell activity induces a negative feedback loop that inhibits the release of LH and FSH. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. LH – This option is incorrect. This might be a tempting option because LH (luteinizing hormone) is involved in testosterone production; however, LH does not directly stimulate spermatogenesis, as the question suggests.  LH stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone. In turn, testosterone indirectly helps promote spermatogenesis. LH also plays a crucial role in the reproductive system of females. Specifically, LH triggers ovulation, helps form the corpus luteum, and later induces the corpus luteum to release progesterone to regulate the menstrual cycle. Option C. Estrogen – This option is incorrect because estrogen is not directly involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis. While estrogen has some functions in males, estrogen is mostly involved in female sexual health and reproductive development. A few of the crucial roles of estrogen in females are ovulation and the development of secondary sex characteristics (e.g., breast development and widening of hips). Option D. Triiodothyronine – This option is incorrect because triiodothyronine (T 3 ) is not directly involved in spermatogenesis. T 3 and T 4 (thyroxine) are the thyroid hormones responsible for the growth and neurological development in children and increasing basal metabolic rate. Both T 3 and T 4 provide negative feedback to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Low secretion of T 3 would result in weight gain and lethargy — not spermatogenesis inhibition, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option E. GH – This option is incorrect because growth hormone (GH), also called somatotropin, is not involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis. Instead, GH stimulates bone and tissue growth. It also stimulates protein synthesis and the use of fats for energy. GH does not have anything to do with the regulation of spermatogenesis, making this answer option incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "This question tests your knowledge of the kidneys and their primary roles: filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion. There are multiple reasons why renal function is crucial. Firstly, the body is an incredibly complex combination of countless biochemical reactions occurring simultaneously and inevitably producing harmful or unwanted byproducts that need disposal. Note that healthy renal function not only involves the disposal of harmful materials but equally as important, the preservation and reabsorption of vital molecules such as glucose . Additionally, the kidneys play a crucial role in regulating blood pressure . By regulating the amount of fluid exiting the body as urine, renal function helps maintain the correct balance of fluid, which is crucial for overall health. To carry out these functions, the kidneys rely on their functional unit, the nephron . In each kidney, up to one million nephrons carry out these four main processes: 1) Filtration, 2) Reabsorption, 3) Secretion, and 4) Excretion. This question asks about a molecule being sent from the filtrate back into the blood, which occurs during reabsorption. Reabsorption prevents the loss (via urine) of vital substances like glucose, amino acids, and necessary ions based on the levels in the body. Out of the answer options provided, only glucose is completely reabsorbed — in fact, if glucose is detected in an individual’s urine, it is indicative of an underlying health issue. Therefore, Option B , Glucose , is the correct option. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Sodium – This option is incorrect . While sodium is often reabsorbed by the nephrons, it is not completely reabsorbed, as this answer option suggests. Instead, sodium is selectively reabsorbed under conditions such as low sodium, low blood pressure, or under activation of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). If sodium levels are too high in the blood, the sodium will instead secrete the excess sodium into the kidney tubules to lower its levels. Option C. Urea – This option is incorrect because urea is almost never reabsorbed back into the blood. When the body breaks down proteins, the main byproduct is ammonia. Because ammonia is toxic, it is converted into the less toxic but still harmful, urea. Given the high rate of protein breakdown occurring in the body, it is clear why urea is one of the main substances found in urine. In fact, “urine” owes its name to urea because it is the second most abundant substance in urine after water. Option D. Protein – This option is incorrect because proteins never make it into the filtrate to begin with. Due to their large size, proteins do not pass through the glomerulus during the filtration step. Since proteins do not leave the bloodstream to begin with, they cannot get reabsorbed into the blood, as this answer option suggests, because they never leave the blood. Like glucose, if any amount of protein is detected in an individual’s urine, it is an indication of a health issue. Option E. Glycogen – This option is incorrect because glycogen is never filtered from the blood to the filtrate. As a large complex carbohydrate, glycogen cannot pass through the glomerulus to be filtrated and, therefore, cannot be reabsorbed into the bloodstream because it was never filtrated in the first place. Recall that renal filtration requires a substance to be small enough to pass through both the gaps in the capillary cell walls, and past the podocytes of the Bowman’s capsule, to successfully enter the kidney tubules.",

In other words, an organism’s ability to consume and/or produce energy to carry out its functions. Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol and is a relatively simple process of harvesting energy from a simple sugar (glucose). To break down glucose, glycolysis consumes two ATP during the energy investment phase and then produces four ATP during the energy payoff phase. The net products of glycolysis are two ATP, two pyruvate, and two NADH which can be used to power further cellular functions. For the test, you should be familiar with the figure below, which shows the first few steps of glycolysis. Glycolysis is considered one of the most ancient metabolic pathways on Earth. For context, glycolysis evolved well before oxygen was present in the Earth's atmosphere, which allowed early organisms to develop without the need for aerobic respiration. As more species continued to appear, glycolysis was maintained even after the presence of oxygen because of its usefulness even in anaerobic conditions. Plants, bacteria, animals, and all living organisms use glycolysis as part of their metabolism, therefore, Option E , Glycolysis , is correct . CC BY 4.0",

Recall that one of the defining features of prokaryotes is that they lack membrane-bound organelles. In eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum is split into rough ER and smooth ER. The rough ER has ribosomes attached to its surface for protein synthesis, whereas the smooth ER lacks ribosomes and synthesizes lipids. In prokaryotes, ribosomes freely float in the cytosol as opposed to being attached to the rough ER, and lipids are produced by the plasma membrane. Option B. Mitochondria – This option is incorrect because prokaryotes (bacteria included) do not have mitochondria. Recall that all prokaryotes lack membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria. Instead of using oxidative phosphorylation from mitochondria, prokaryotes rely on alternative means of energy production (either strictly using glycolysis and fermentation or using their plasma membrane to perform further respiration steps). Option C. Cell Wall – This option is incorrect because animal cells do not contain a cell wall. Cell walls are found in all prokaryotes but not all eukaryotes. Namely, cell walls are found in archaea, bacteria, fungi, and plants but are not found in animal cells. Instead of a cell wall, animals have a plasma membrane composed of mainly phospholipids. Not all eukaryotes have a cell wall, so it cannot be considered universal to all living organisms, making this option incorrect. Option D. Nucleus – This option is incorrect because all prokaryotes lack a nucleus.

    "category": "Evolution, Ecology, & Behavior",
    "explanation": {
      "concept_text": "Many of the behaviors observed in animals can be attributed to evolution and natural selection. Remember evolution does not only select for the ability to survive and reproduce, but just as importantly, it selects for the ability to pass down genes —either directly or indirectly. Direct fitness refers to the reproductive success of an individual, whereas indirect fitness refers to the reproductive success of the genetic relatives of the individual (who share numerous similar and/or identical alleles with the individual). Some animals have evolved altruistic behaviors that decrease the individual’s fitness but increase their group’s overall fitness (fitness is the ability to survive and produce fertile offspring). Within a family, there is a higher percentage of shared (or even identical) alleles when compared to individuals outside the family. Therefore, an indirect way for an individual to pass down genes is to improve the fitness of their relatives by performing altruistic behaviors such as alarm-calling or resource-sharing. This works because it improves the group’s fitness, and by extension, makes them more likely to pass down alleles also shared by the altruistic individual. It is important to note that for a behavior to be considered altruistic, it must come at a cost to the individual (that is, put the individual at a disadvantage.) For example, vampire bats have been observed to regurgitate and share blood with starving roost-mates. Although the regurgitating bat is putting itself at a potentially life-threatening disadvantage by reducing its energy consumption, this behavior is improving the survival chances of fellow bats and, therefore, increases the inclusive fitness of the group. Remember that natural selection primarily favors genetic success, not necessarily reproductive success. Option B is the only option where an individual (prairie dog) puts itself at a disadvantage (calling predator’s attention to itself) just to alert its relatives, and therefore, improve their fitness. As such, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. A deer performs a mating dance – This option is incorrect because a mating dance is not an altruistic behavior. Recall that an altruistic behavior decreases direct fitness by incurring a cost on the individual (e.g., attention of a predator) while simultaneously increasing indirect fitness by providing a benefit to the group (e.g., the group is alerted of a nearby predator). In contrast, a mating dance is performed to benefit the individual by increasing its own reproductive success (attracts potential mates). Therefore, it is not an altruistic behavior. A mating dance is an example of a courtship ritual; that is, a behavior that attracts a potential mate through displays such as dances, calls, bright colors, or duels between males. Furthermore, courtship rituals ensure that mating occurs only within members of the same species. This is important as it ensures genetic compatibility, increases reproductive success, and helps maintain the integrity of species boundaries. Option C. Mother fish preferentially feed their immediate children – This option is incorrect because this behavior is not altruistic; instead, it is a classic example of parental investment. By choosing to feed her immediate relatives (children), the mother is maximizing the survival chances of her direct descendants, thus increasing the possibility of the mother’s own alleles being passed down. Remember, for a behavior to be considered altruistic, it must incur a cost to the individual (such as reduced reproductive success or increased risk of being spotted by a predator). Although this behavior increases the fitness of the mother’s offspring, it does not put the mother at a disadvantage, therefore, this behavior is not altruistic. Option D. A bird refuses to nurture the weakest hatchling – This option is incorrect because this behavior is not altruistic. By employing this strategy, the parent is selectively allocating resources to maximize the chances of raising fertile offspring to pass down the parent’s own alleles. From the perspective of a parent seeking genetic success, instead of equally dividing labor and available resources between all hatchlings, it is sometimes more beneficial to identify the offspring with the highest fitness and prioritize them to ensure the highest chances of genetic success. The behavior described by this option is not altruistic for two reasons. First, the advantage of increased fitness is given selectively to only some of the offspring . Additionally, this behavior does not incur a cost to the parent (such as reduced reproductive success or increased risk of being spotted by a predator) and, therefore, does not match the definition of altruistic behavior. Option E. Fish move in schools to protect against predators – This option is incorrect because moving in groups (such as herds, flocks, or schools) is not altruistic behavior. Moving in groups is beneficial to all members of the group and does not place a disproportionate disadvantage on one individual (as seen in altruism). Moreover, it provides improved foraging efficiency (gathering food) as well as improved vigilance and protection against potential predators. Moving in a group may allow for altruistic behaviors to occur — such as a chimpanzee sounding an alarm call to its group — however, the act of moving in a group is not intrinsically altruistic because no individual incurs a cost to increase indirect fitness. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "Ecological succession is the process by which an ecological community changes over time (i.e. a change in the species inhabiting an area). This change may occur for several reasons and is divided into two general types: primary and secondary succession. Primary succession occurs when a habitat is colonized by life for the first time after previously being completely lifeless . This is caused by a large disturbance in the habitat that allows life to flourish such as a volcanic eruption leaving freshly cooled down lava, a dust storm forming new sand dunes, or a retreating glacier revealing new rocks for life to form for the first time. Remember that the key concept here is that primary succession is the very first time a particular habitat is colonized by life. Secondary succession occurs when a natural habitat, that was previously occupied by vegetation and life, experiences a disturbance that eliminates most or all life (e.g., wildfire, hurricane, or deforestation) but is later recolonized by life/vegetation. Although the question does not mention the term secondary succession, the wording “ already established ecosystem ” indicates that life has existed in this habitat before, making it a secondary succession. The figure below illustrates both types of succession. A deforestation event can be a significant disturbance that eliminates many sources of food and vegetation, which can then eliminate many forms of life. Consequently, this may pave the way for secondary succession to occur in the recently affected ecological community. Therefore, Option C , Deforestation, is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Newly formed sand dunes – This option is incorrect because newly formed sand dunes are pieces of land that did not exist before. Since this new habitat has never held life before, it has no previously established ecosystem. A colonization event here would constitute primary succession, not secondary, making this answer option incorrect. Option B. Land formed from solidified lava – This option is incorrect because the question specifically refers to an “already established ecosystem” whereas newly formed land from lava would be classified as a new habitat, and therefore, life would not have existed there before. The question is specifically asking about secondary succession, however, newly formed land from lava can only induce primary succession, not secondary. Option D. Seasonal change in sea level – This option is incorrect because while seasonal changes in sea levels can alter the conditions of an ecosystem, they do not necessarily result in ecological succession unless they cause a significant disturbance or change to the existing community of species. Additionally, the “seasonal” change in sea level suggests that these changes are fairly predictable, and any affected species are likely to have evolved adaptations. In contrast, secondary succession is usually caused by disturbances such as flooding, wildfires, and hurricanes. Option E. Permafrost – This option is incorrect because permafrost is not an event ; rather, the term permafrost describes the state of the ground. Just like a piece of land may be described as sandy or chalky, permafrost describes a piece of land that is frozen most of the year; therefore, it cannot be considered a disturbance that would lead to ecological succession. Note that permafrost does not necessarily mean pure ice; rather, permafrost is soil that remains below freezing temperature. Permafrost is predominantly seen within tundra biomes and can only support short vegetation because of the frozen ground.",

Therefore, the correct answer to this question is Option A. Right ventricle , because the right ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonary circuit, as mentioned above. Furthermore, you can also answer this question by knowing the overall flow of blood throughout the heart: Blood from the body → superior & inferior vena cava → right atrium → right ventricle → pulmonary artery → Lungs When the blood picks up oxygen in the lungs, it then flows from the lungs in this direction: To the pulmonary veins → left atrium → left ventricle → aorta → Body CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Left ventricle – This option is incorrect because the left ventricle pumps blood to the entire body. In other words, it pumps blood through the systemic circuit. The left ventricle has thicker muscle walls compared to the right ventricle because the systemic circuit is much larger than the pulmonary circuit (both in terms of blood volume and distance traveled by blood). Option C. Right atrium – This option is incorrect because the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the rest of the body through the superior and inferior vena cava. From the right atrium, blood must first flow through the tricuspid valve and into the right ventricle to then be pumped into the pulmonary circuit. Option D. Aorta – This option is incorrect for two reasons. First, the aorta is not a chamber of the heart. Recall that the heart is composed of two upper chambers called the atria, and two lower chambers called the ventricles. Moreover, the aorta is the primary blood vessel through which oxygenated blood reaches body tissue; therefore, the aorta is part of the systemic circuit, not the pulmonary, making this answer option incorrect. The aorta is particularly muscular because it must withstand the force of blood being pumped from the left ventricle to the entire body. Option E. Left atrium – This option is incorrect because the left atrium does not pump blood into the pulmonary circuit – instead, the left atrium receives blood from the pulmonary circuit. More specifically, the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins.",

The ileocecal valve separates the small and large intestines. If the ileocecal sphincter were damaged, the passage of digested material between the small and large intestines would be disrupted. As seen in the figure below, the ileum, the longest part of the small intestine, joins the cecum, the first portion of the large intestine, at the ileocecal valve.

The sphincter of Oddi does not influence the passage between small and large intestines, making this answer option incorrect. Option B. Pyloric sphincter – This option is incorrect because the pyloric sphincter allows partially digested food (chyme) to pass from the stomach to the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). The pyloric sphincter does not regulate the passage between the small and large intestines, making this answer option incorrect. Option D. Esophageal sphincter – This option is incorrect because the esophageal sphincter allows food to pass from the esophagus into the stomach. Since the esophageal sphincter does not regulate the passage between small and large intestines, this answer option is incorrect. Note: although the esophageal sphincter is also known as the cardiac sphincter (because it is close to the heart), it does NOT regulate or interact with the heart. Option E. Rectum – This option is incorrect . Not only is the rectum neither a sphincter nor a valve, but the rectum is at the end of the digestive tract, well past the junction between the small and large intestines.

      "concept_text": "The cell membrane is said to be a lipid bilayer because it is made up of a double layer of phospholipids. Because they have both a hydrophilic and hydrophobic part, phospholipids are amphipathic . The negative charge of the phosphate group makes the phosphate head hydrophilic . Consequently, the heads of the outer layer face the extracellular liquid, while the hydrophilic phosphate heads of the inner layer face the cytosol – both aqueous environments. This leaves the hydrophobic fatty acids tails of both layers to inwardly face each other and minimize exposure to water. Fatty acid tails are hydrophobic because they are made up of mostly non-polar bonds between carbon and hydrogen. Therefore, Option D , Fatty acid tail , is the correct answer. The plasma membrane is also referred to as the “ fluid mosaic model ” because its structure resembles a fluid and flexible mosaic of different components embedded in the phospholipid bilayer (e.g., proteins, cholesterol, and carbohydrates). None of the phospholipids are rigidly bound to each other, so phospholipids are constantly sliding laterally within the layer and are free to move around – hence the term “fluid.” The fluid mosaic model plays a crucial role in the membrane’s selective permeability, flexibility, enzymatic activity, and cell signaling. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Polar head – This option is incorrect because the polar head is hydrophilic – not hydrophobic. The polar head is made up of a phosphate group and a glycerol molecule. The phosphate group has a distinct negative charge because of the oxygen atoms (PO₄³⁻). This creates an uneven distribution of electrons throughout the molecule, making it highly polar, just like water. Since “like dissolves like,” this makes the polar head hydrophilic – not hydrophobic. Option B. Phosphate group – This option is incorrect because the phosphate group is part of the hydrophilic polar head. In fact, the phosphate group is what gives the polar head its hydrophilicity due to the strong negative charge of the four oxygen atoms (PO 4 3- ). By carrying a highly negative charge, the phosphate group makes the head of the phospholipid highly polar (just like water), and since “like dissolves like,” the polar head is hydrophilic and directly interacts with aqueous environments. Option C. Ribosomal subunit - This option is incorrect because ribosomal subunits are not part of the cell membrane. Ribosomes are formed from two ribosomal subunits (one larger and one smaller). Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have ribosomes freely floating in their cytosol, however, eukaryotes also have ribosomes embedded in their rough ER. Ribosomes are made up of RNA and protein and they serve as the site of protein synthesis in the cell. Neither eukaryotic nor prokaryotic ribosomes are located in the cell membrane, making this answer option incorrect Option E. Glycoproteins – This option is incorrect because glycoproteins embedded in a cell’s membrane can have both a hydrophilic and hydrophobic portion; this makes glycoproteins amphipathic – not only hydrophobic, as suggested by this answer option. The portion that faces out toward the aqueous environment is hydrophilic, while the portion that is embedded deep in the lipid bilayer is hydrophobic. Note: remember, the terms “cell membrane” and “lipid bilayer” are not synonymous; rather, the cell membrane has multiple components, one of which being the lipid bilayer.",

Examples of protostomes include mollusks, arthropods, and annelids. In deuterostomes , the blastopore becomes the anus first; the oral end of the animal develops later from the second opening.

Many enzymes are synthesized in their inactive form and are later activated when they reach their target tissue. For example, the zymogen pepsinogen is the inactive form of pepsin. Pepsinogen is secreted by chief cells in the mucosal layer of the stomach. Once hydrochloric acid (HCl) is secreted by parietal cells into the stomach lumen, it causes pepsinogen to be cleaved into its active form, pepsin . The term “cleavage” is used to describe this activation process because, as seen in the figure below, it involves the breakage of a bond to remove a peptide chain and reveal the enzyme’s active site. Once pepsinogen is activated into pepsin, it is then able to hydrolyze peptide bonds to break down proteins. As such, the correct answer to this question is Option A , It directly catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds . Since pepsinogen is a zymogen, it is inactive and cannot directly catalyze any reactions; in other words, it must be activated before it can perform enzymatic functions. CC BY 4.0",

Recall that pepsinogen is a zymogen and, by definition, it exists in an inactive state. The activation of pepsinogen to pepsin relies on hydrochloric acid (HCl) being released by parietal cells. Without the presence of HCl, pepsinogen would remain in its inactive form. Option C. It must be activated for digestion – This option is incorrect because this is a true statement; pepsinogen must be activated for digestion because it is a zymogen. Recall that a zymogen is the inactive form of another enzyme and is unable to carry out any function without first being activated. Option D. It is a proenzyme – This option is incorrect because this is a true statement pepsinogen is a proenzyme because “proenzyme” is another term for “zymogen” – an enzyme in its inactive form. Option E. It is activated by cleavage – This option is incorrect because this is a true statement; indeed, HCl causes pepsinogen to cleave itself into pepsin. When hydrochloric acid (released by parietal cells) interacts with pepsinogen, it cleaves a peptide chain from pepsinogen, thus revealing the active site and turning the enzyme into its active form, pepsin. This option may have been tempting because of the term “cleavage.” Recall that, generally in biology the term cleavage refers to the act of splitting, separating, or dividing. In this example, a peptide chain is cleaved (separated) from the enzyme to reveal the active site, thus activating pepsinogen into pepsin.",

      "poe_text": "Option A. Similar modes of transport – This option is incorrect . Just because two or more species within an ecological ecosystem have similar modes of transport (e.g. birds flying or fish swimming), does not necessarily mean that said species will compete. While it is more likely for two species with similar modes of transport to occupy the same ecosystem and interact with each other, that is not enough to incite interspecies competition. The requirement for interspecies competition to occur is there must be an environment with limited resources and two or more species that rely on said resources. Option B. External fertilization – This option is incorrect because external fertilization does not induce interspecies competition. External fertilization is when the sperm and egg fuse outside the body; it is used by fish and amphibians to prevent their gametes from drying out. While external fertilization may expose the fusion of gametes to other species, this alone does not constitute interspecies competition. The requirement for interspecies competition to occur is there must be an environment with limited resources (such as nutrients or territory) and two or more species that rely on said resources. Option C. Hypertonic – This option is incorrect because the term hypertonic describes the relative concentration of solute in a solution and is completely unrelated to competition between species. Hypertonicity is observed when a cell is in a solution in which there is a higher solute concentration outside the cell, forcing water to leave the cell to achieve homeostasis; as a result, the cell shrinks.  Hypertonicity is completely unrelated to the concept of interspecies competition. All instances of interspecies competition occur because there is an environment with limited resources (such as nutrients or territory) and two or more species that rely on said resources. Option E. Hybrid zone – This option is incorrect . A hybrid zone is a geographical boundary where hybridization occurs; that is, a land area within which two different species mate and give rise to offspring of mixed ancestry. Over time, this relationship between the two species can lead to one of three outcomes: reinforcement (the two species continue to diverge until they can no longer mate), fusion (the two species evolve into one species), or stability (two species remain distinct but with enough similarities to continue mating with each other). Hybrid zones do not foster interspecies competition; in fact, hybrid zones foster the opposite: mating between species (hybridization). Therefore, this answer option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "The skin is divided into three main layers: epidermis (most superficial), dermis (middle), and hypodermis (deepest).  The epidermis can be further divided into the following five layers (from most superficial to deepest): For questions regarding the skin, make sure you have memorized both names for the deepest layer of the epidermis (stratum germinativum/basale) as they are interchangeable. The deepest layer of the epidermis, the stratum germinativum consists of a single row of stem cells that continually divide to give rise to new skin cells Therefore, Option A , Stratum germinativum , is the correct answer. Of the two daughter cells produced from each mitotic division, one cell remains in the germinativum layer to continue dividing while the other begins differentiating into a mature skin cell known as a keratinocyte . As constant cell division pushes the skin cells outward through the epidermal layers and toward the skin surface, they fill with keratin, flatten, and lose their organelles. The outermost layer of the epidermis, the Stratum corneum , is composed of 20–30 layers of these dead keratin-filled cells. The stratum corneum functions as a hydrophobic physical barrier to protect the organism against pathogens, ultraviolet light, water loss, and injury. We recommend knowing these concepts for the test. Below is an illustration to help visualize this concept: CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Stratum spinosum – This option is incorrect because the stratum spinosum does not produce new skin cells; only the deepest layer of the epidermis (stratum germinativum aka basale) produces new skin cells. Instead, the stratum spinosum provides strength and flexibility to the skin due to the desmosome junctions that tightly hold several layers of keratinocytes together. These protruding junctions give the layer a “spiny” appearance, hence the name spinosum. In addition, the stratum spinosum contributes to the skin's immune response by housing Langerhans cells. Option C. Stratum corneum – This option is incorrect because the stratum corneum does not produce new skin cells; in fact, it is the last layer to receive the skin cells produced by the stratum germinativum (deepest layer) as they move toward the skin’s surface. As the skin’s outermost layer, the stratum corneum forms the primary hydrophobic barrier against pathogens, ultraviolet light, water loss, and injury. This protection is achieved by 20-30 layers of dead and flattened keratinocytes. Option D. Stratum lucidum – This option is incorrect because the stratum lucidum does not produce new skin cells. Instead, the stratum lucidum provides additional thickness and support in areas of high friction and it is present only in the soles of feet and palms of hands. Option E. Stratum granulosum – This option is incorrect because the stratum granulosum does not produce new skin cells. Instead, the stratum granulosum is a layer of dying cells that have begun to flatten as they go through apoptosis. As the name suggests, the stratum granulosum contains granules that release hydrophobic lipids, which contribute to the waterproof properties of the skin.",

      "concept_text": "Cell membranes are selectively permeable; that is, some substances can pass through the membrane while others cannot. The movement of particles through the cell membrane can be divided into two broad categories: Passive vs Active Transport. Small, uncharged molecules (e.g. O 2, CO 2 , or hydrophobic molecules) use passive transport to pass through the membrane down their concentration gradient without the input of energy . In contrast, active transport requires the input of energy to move particles against their concentration gradient . While some substances can simply pass directly through the membrane, others require facilitated transport. Facilitated transport is the use of a channel or carrier used by larger molecules (e.g. glucose) or charged particles (e.g. ions) that cannot cross the membrane directly by themselves. Passive transport can be simple diffusion or facilitated, depending on the molecule - but active transport must always by facilitated by a protein carrier or channel. Passive transport is a general term that can encompass passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion (down the concentration gradient), osmosis, dialysis, and countercurrent exchange. Passive diffusion is the simplest mechanism by which a molecule can cross the plasma membrane. Any lipid-soluble molecule can diffuse across the phospholipid bilayer (due to being small and non-polar) and directly enter the cytosol of the cell. Therefore, Option B , Passive diffusion , is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Osmosis – This option is incorrect because osmosis refers to the movement of a solvent (typically water) – not a solute such as lipid-soluble molecules. To elaborate, osmosis is the process by which water passes through a semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution into a more concentrated one. Although lipid-soluble molecules can move through a semipermeable membrane, they are not the solvent, therefore, their movement cannot be labeled as osmosis. Option C. Active transport – This option is incorrect because active transport involves transporter proteins that require energy to move molecules against their gradient (from a low to a high concentration). Active transport is not typically used for lipid-soluble molecules because there is no need for energy input to transport them across the cell membrane; lipid-soluble molecules can usually diffuse unassisted down their concentration gradient. In contrast, active transport is usually used by large and/or polar molecules because they cannot pass through the cell membrane on their own (input of energy is needed). Option D. Filtration – This option is incorrect because filtration is typically not used for the transport of lipid-soluble molecules across the cell membrane. Filtration is the process of separating suspended particles from a fluid through a porous material in which the fluid can pass while the suspended particles are retained. In the body, filtration is most commonly seen in the nephrons of the kidney where blood is filtered. Only specific molecules are allowed to pass out of the blood from the glomerulus and into the kidney tubules. Option E. Apoptosis – This option is incorrect because apoptosis is not a process by which substances cross a cell membrane. Rather, apoptosis is programmed cell death. Apoptosis is part of normal cell function & development and occurs in many instances, including the elimination of infected or damaged cells, embryonic development, and operation of the nervous system. While critical to proper cell function, apoptosis is not directly involved in cross-membrane transport, which makes this answer option incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "The patterns of evolution across time often vary depending on the environmental pressures faced by different species. To answer this question, we need to know the difference between analogous vs homologous structures as well as convergent vs divergent lineages. When two species have a similar body structure (such as wings, fins, or forelimbs), the relationship between said structure can be described as either analogous or homologous. If two different species without a common ancestor face similar environmental pressures (such as environmental changes or predators), they may independently evolve analogous structures in response to said pressures. For example, birds and butterflies both experienced an environmental pressure to develop the ability to fly and each species independently developed its wings. Therefore, their wings are said to be analogous structures. Homologous structures also resemble each other; however, the two species do share a recent common ancestor and they inherited said structure from their common ancestor. For example, all vertebrates owe their forelimbs to their common ancestor. Therefore, the forelimbs of humans, bats, and whales are said to be homologous. The concept of convergent vs divergent evolution is very closely tied to analogous and homologous structures. As seen in the figure below, convergent evolution can give rise to analogous structures while, on the other hand, divergent evolution can give rise to homologous structures. Convergent evolution occurs when two species without a common ancestor grow more and more alike over time (they “converge”) due to similar environmental pressures. In contrast, divergent evolution occurs when two species who do share a recent common ancestor become increasingly different over time (they “diverge”). This question mentions that dolphins and marine fish are “distinct lineages” which means they do not share a recent common ancestor. Therefore, their similar trait is a result of convergent evolution, which makes Option C , Analogous and convergent , the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Homologous and convergent – This option is incorrect because the fins of dolphins and marine fish are said to be analogous structures, not homologous . This question mentions that dolphins and marine fish have “distinct lineages” which means they do not share a recent common ancestor, as dolphins are mammals, not fish. Recall that if two species exhibit similar structures without having a recent common ancestor, the structures are said to be analogous. It should be noted that this answer option is only partly incorrect because the relationship between the two lineages is indeed convergent. This is because the two species are not genetically related, yet they evolved to be more alike over time. Nevertheless, this answer option as a whole is incorrect because the structures are analogous. Option B. Homologous and divergent – This option is incorrect because the fins of dolphins and marine fish are said to be analogous structures, not homologous . This question mentions that dolphins and marine fish have “distinct lineages” which means they do not share a recent common ancestor; after all, dolphins are mammals – not fish. Recall that if two species exhibit similar structures without having a recent common ancestor, the structures are said to be analogous because they must have developed independently. Moreover, the distinct lineages are an indication that convergent evolution took place, and not divergent, as this option suggests. Option D. Analogous and divergent – This option is incorrect because divergent evolution occurs between species that have a recent common ancestor. Since this question mentions that dolphins and marine fish have “distinct lineages” we know that they do not share a recent common ancestor; after all, dolphins are mammals – not fish. Therefore, their fins must have developed independently through convergent evolution after experiencing similar environmental pressures. It should be noted that this answer option is only partly incorrect because the fins are indeed analogous structures. This is because the two species are not genetically related, yet they evolved similar structures due to similar evolutionary pressures. Nevertheless, this answer option as a whole is incorrect because the lineages are convergent – not divergent. Option E. Parallel and stabilizing – This option is incorrect because parallel evolution is when two related species (i.e. they share a recent common ancestor) undergo similar changes. This is different from divergent evolution, which occurs when related species undergo changes that are not similar and “diverge” from each other (such as human hands vs bird wings vs whale fins). Moreover, this option is incorrect because stabilizing selection does not occur between different species. Rather, stabilizing selection occurs within a population of one species and describes the tendency of intermediate values to be favored over extreme values, forming a bell curve.",

      "concept_text": "Maintaining genetic diversity within a population is extremely important in the context of evolution. Without it, a population would be unable to adapt to new evolutionary pressures and would also experience increased inbreeding. Crossing over is one of the main ways that nature increases genetic diversity within a population. As such, crossing over occurs only in meiosis and not mitosis (recall that mitosis creates genetically identical daughter cells, i.e. minimizes genetic diversity) . In simple terms, crossing over is the exchange of DNA between paired homologous chromosomes (one from each parent). Crossing over occurs during prophase of meiosis I and begins when two homologous chromosomes (one inherited from each parent) pair up in a process known as synapsis. Each pair of homologous chromosomes — each made up of two sister chromatids — tightly align to form a structure called a tetrad , being held by the synaptonemal complex. The formation of this structure is necessary for segments of the chromosomes to be swapped between the homologous pairs, and thus create new and genetically unique chromosomes that are passed to the offspring. Since the exchange of DNA between non-sister chromatids cannot proceed without the formation of a tetrad, Option B , Tetrads , is the correct answer. The regions where crossing over occurs are referred to as chiasmata .",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Lysosomes – This option is incorrect because lysosomes are not directly involved in any aspect of chromosomal crossing over. Lysosomes are vesicles that contain digestive enzymes with low pH. As such, lysosomes are involved in numerous crucial cellular functions including the breakdown of bacteria and cell debris, apoptosis, autophagy, and the digestion of food particles after endocytosis While lysosomes are vital to proper cellular function, they are not directly involved in chromosomal crossover, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option C. Centrosome – This option is incorrect because centrosomes are not directly involved in chromosomal crossing over. Centrosomes are two organelles found near the nucleus of animal cells and contribute to cell division as microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs). Recall that MTCOs are crucial to cell division because they form the mitotic spindle, which pulls sister chromatids apart during anaphase. While vital in proper cell function and cell division, centrosomes do not contribute directly to chromosomal crossing over, therefore, this option is incorrect. Another reason this option is incorrect is that centrosomes are already present in a cell – they are not formed. Note: remember the difference between centro some vs centro mere, as the two are often confused. Centromeres are not organelles ; rather, a centromere is the region of DNA where the two sister chromatids are linked together after replication. Also recall that kinetochores (yellow dots in the figure above) are protein complexes where spindle fibers attach in order to pull the sister chromatids apart during cell division. Kinetochores are located on centromeres. Option D. Chitin – This option is incorrect because chitin is not directly involved in any aspect of chromosomal crossing over. Chitin is a structural polysaccharide made from polymers of beta-glucose that contain nitrogen atoms. Chitin is commonly found in fungal cell walls and the exoskeleton of arthropods and does not contribute to chromosomal crossing over, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option E. Cleavage furrow – This option is incorrect because the cleavage furrow is not directly involved in any aspect of chromosomal crossing over. The cleavage furrow is a contractile ring that forms in the later stages of animal cell division during cytokinesis. Using actin and myosin microfilaments, the ring contracts and pinches the cytoplasm into two separate daughter cells. The cleavage furrow is a crucial structure for cytokinesis; however, it does not contribute to chromosomal crossing over, which makes this answer option incorrect.",

Therefore, Option A , Hair , is the correct answer; all the other features are also found in Classes other than Mammalia. Hair grows in follicles derived from the stratum germinativum of the epidermis and it provides insulation as well as some additional protection to the animal. Hair growth continues until mitotic division in the root stops. Individuals in which mitosis completely stops at the hair root are more likely to go bald.",

Keratin is a fibrous structural protein found in all chordates and it is used to form specialized tissue such as hair, nails, claws, horns, antlers, and beaks. Keratin plays a crucial role in the strength and protection of several body structures in many animal classes (other than mammals), making this answer option incorrect. Option C. Melanin – This option is incorrect because melanin is a broad term for a group of natural pigments found in most organisms including mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and birds. Melanin contributes to color variation in hair, skin, and iris of the eyes and has a crucial role in skin protection against UV radiation — hence the lower rates of skin cancer in individuals with higher skin pigmentation. Melanin is produced by melanocytes located in the stratum basale of the epidermis (aka stratum germinativum). Because melanin is not exclusive to mammals, this option is incorrect. Option D. Dermis – This option is incorrect because the dermis layer of the skin is not exclusive to mammals; in fact, all vertebrate animals have a dermis layer (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, etc.). In mammals, the dermis layer contains hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands, whereas in other vertebrates it contains dermal scales (reptiles) and feathers (birds). Option E. Adipose tissue – This option is incorrect because adipose tissue is not exclusive to mammals. Adipose tissue is present in other animal classes such as birds, reptiles, and amphibians.

      "concept_text": "One of the ways we can classify life on earth is by each organism’s ability to grow in the presence – or absence – of oxygen. To some organisms oxygen is toxic, to other organisms, oxygen is vital for metabolizing energy, and other organisms lay somewhere in between. Obligate aerobes are strictly aerobic (require oxygen). Obligate anaerobes are strictly anaerobic (oxygen is toxic). Aerotolerant anaerobes cannot use oxygen for energy, however, oxygen does not kill them. Microaerophiles require oxygen, however, too much oxygen may be harmful to them. Finally, facultative anaerobes are organisms that make ATP through aerobic respiration if oxygen is present but are also capable of switching to anaerobic respiration or fermentation if oxygen is absent. For example, bacteria such as E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., and certain fungi are facultative anaerobes. Therefore, Option C , Facultative anaerobes , is the correct answer. Note that the vast majority of the microorganisms found in the body of humans and mammals are facultative anaerobes The figure below illustrates the different types of organisms that exist in nature. Notice how for each organism, the higher its dependency on oxygen, the closer to the surface it resides (where oxygen concentration is highest) and vice versa. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Obligate aerobes – This option is incorrect because obligate aerobes are organisms that constantly require oxygen to grow. Through cellular respiration, these organisms use oxygen to metabolize substances like sugars or fats to obtain energy. In this type of respiration, oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor for the electron transport chain. Option B. Obligate anaerobes – This option is incorrect because obligate anaerobes are organisms that can only live in environments that lack oxygen (i.e. anaerobic environments). Unlike most organisms in the world, these organisms are poisoned by oxygen. Obligate anaerobes are typically bacteria. Option D. Aerotolerant anaerobes – This option is incorrect because aerotolerant anaerobes are organisms with an exclusively anaerobic (fermentative) type of metabolism, but they are insensitive to the presence of oxygen. Unlike obligate anaerobes, aerotolerant anaerobes are not killed by oxygen. They live by fermentation alone whether or not oxygen is present in their environment. Option E. Microaerophiles – This option is incorrect because microaerophiles are microorganisms that require oxygen to survive, however, too much oxygen exposure may be harmful. Microaerophiles require environments containing lower levels of oxygen than the atmosphere.",

      "concept_text": "If a bodybuilder injects himself with testosterone and other androgens regularly, there is an increase in overall testosterone concentration in his body, and because of testosterone’s negative feedback on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, this causes downregulation of natural testosterone production by the testes . Since testicle cells are also responsible for sperm production (a.k.a. spermatogenesis), the negative feedback that shuts down this organ to cease natural testosterone function, also inadvertently shuts off sperm production. Therefore, Option A , Decreased spermatogenesis , is the correct answer. In normal physiological conditions, testosterone is produced from the Leydig cells (interstitial cells of the testes, shown in the figure below). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is released from the hypothalamus and stimulates the anterior pituitary to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). LH then stimulates the Leydig cells to produce testosterone. As part of testosterone regulation, testosterone itself exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary, reducing the release of GnRH and LH, respectively. In the question above, injection of testosterone and other androgens would elicit the same negative feedback loop, resulting in the downregulation of natural testosterone production – but also the downregulation of spermatogenesis, as FSH production is inhibited. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Increase of natural testosterone production – This option is incorrect because this would cause a decrease of natural testosterone production instead of an increase. As seen in the figure above, testosterone exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, resulting in the downregulation of FSH release. Downregulated release of FSH from the anterior pituitary would cause decreased spermatogenesis. Option C. Decreased estrogen release – This option is incorrect because testosterone does not affect the release of estrogen. Instead, increased testosterone may result in the aromatization of testosterone into estrogen (thereby increasing estrogen levels); however, the details of this process are out of the scope of the test. Option D. Decreased muscle mass – This option is incorrect because increased testosterone concentration in the body (whether injected or naturally produced) would result in the opposite; there would be an increased muscle mass as long as there is sufficient muscle stimulation (i.e. working out). This is because one of testosterone’s main functions is to stimulate protein synthesis in muscles. Enhanced muscle mass is one of the primary reasons for testosterone injections by bodybuilders and other athletes. Option E. Increased size of testes – This option is incorrect because injections of testosterone or other androgens will cause a decrease in natural spermatogenesis and atrophy (loss of mass) of the testes because the natural production of testosterone will be significantly reduced.",

      "concept_text": "Proteins are macromolecules that serve numerous crucial functional, structural, and regulatory roles in the body. Proteins can be categorized into four distinct structural levels: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. The most fundamental of the four, the primary protein structure, is a chain of amino acids bonded together via peptide bonds. The other three structures cannot exist without the proper synthesis of the peptide chain that makes up the primary structure. Recall that protein synthesis follows the central dogma , which states that DNA is transcribed into mRNA, and mRNA is then translated into protein. The translation of mRNA into protein is carried out by ribosomes that travel along an mRNA strand and add one amino acid for every three nucleotides being read. The ribosomes are also responsible for the creation of the peptide bonds that hold amino acids together. Every time a ribosome adds a new amino acid to the chain, it also forms a peptide bond between adjacent amino acids through dehydration synthesis. Once a ribosome has finished translating an mRNA strand, a polypeptide chain is formed, which makes up the primary structure of proteins. Because the nucleotide sequence of mRNA is directly translated into the sequence of amino acids that form the primary structure of the protein, Option C , Nucleotide sequence of the mRNA , is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Hydrogen bonding – This option is incorrect because hydrogen bonding is essential in shaping the secondary and tertiary protein structures – not the primary. Alpha helices and beta sheets are held together by hydrogen bonding between amino acids of adjacent peptide chains. Numerous side chains contain functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding (e.g. hydroxyl group, amino group, carbonyl group, and carboxyl group). In addition, hydrogen bonds between side chains of amino acids stabilize the folds of the tertiary structure and therefore contribute to its overall 3D shape. While important for the secondary and tertiary structure of proteins, R-group interactions do not directly determine primary protein structure. Option B. Interaction between amino acid R-groups – This option is incorrect because interactions between amino acid R groups give rise to primarily tertiary protein structures – not primary. Recall that each amino acid consists of a central carbon, an amino group, a carboxylic acid group, and the R-group a.k.a. side chain. Each amino acid has its own unique R-group which determines the amino acid’s structure, function, and other important characteristics such as polarity and charge. R-group interactions can consist of 5 main types of interactions: hydrogen-bonding, ionic bonding, hydrophobic interactions, disulfide bonds, and Van der Waals forces. While important for the tertiary structure of proteins, R-group interactions do not directly determine primary protein structure. Option D. Disulfide bonds – This option is incorrect because disulfide bonds contribute to tertiary structure – not primary. As seen in the figure above, disulfide bonds are a type of covalent bond that can form between two sulfur-containing cysteine R-groups. While important for the tertiary structure of proteins, disulfide bonds do not directly determine primary protein structure. It is important to remember that among the four macromolecules, only proteins exhibit disulfide bonds. One important example is the role of disulfide bonds in the structural integrity of im munoglobulins (a type of protein). Disulfide bonds maintain the overall structure of an antibody by linking the light and heavy chains together. Option E. Promoter sequence length – This option is incorrect because promoter sequences do not directly determine primary protein structures. Instead. promoter sequences define the exact location along a DNA strand where RNA polymerase should start transcribing a gene. While they play a crucial role in gene expression, promoter sequences do not directly determine primary protein structure.",

      "concept_text": "In general terms, animals can be divided into three categories based on their diet: herbivores consume only plants, carnivores consume only meat, and omnivores fall in the middle and consume both plants and meat. Animal flesh and plants are composed of different materials, and therefore, require a different set of body structures to be metabolized. For example, the muscles, organs, and skin of animals are mostly composed of proteins and lipids. Therefore, a meat-consuming animal needs sharp teeth to tear and chew meat, and also needs the appropriate enzymes in the digestive tract to break down the high protein content. On the other hand, plants are mainly composed of cellulose and other carbohydrates. Because of its beta-1,4 bonds and its tightly packed structure, cellulose is a notably challenging molecule to be processed for extraction of nutrients – both while chewing and later while being metabolized in the digestive tract. Moreover, when compared to meat, plants are generally less nutrient-dense, which makes it harder to extract sufficient quantities of nutrients from plants. For these reasons, an animal that only consumes plants (herbivores) cannot survive without specialized body structures for the proper digestion of plants. For example, flat molar teeth allow for grinding and crushing tough plant materials and, more importantly, a long digestive tract allows for an increased surface area to house the digestive enzymes that break down cellulose while simultaneously increasing total digestion time . This allows for maximal absorption of nutrients from plants despite their lower density of nutrients and the challenge of digesting cellulose. Therefore, Option E, Long digestive tract , is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Sharp teeth – This option is incorrect because herbivores do not have sharp teeth. Instead, herbivores have wide and flat teeth that assist in grinding and crushing tough plant materials. Recall that plants are very high in cellulose, which is difficult to break down. Flat teeth allow for better crushing and grinding of plant tissue; therefore, flat teeth aid in the absorption of nutrients from plants by preparing plant materials for digestion in the small and large intestines. In contrast, carnivores have sharp teeth that help them kill prey and later tear the meat off the bone while eating. Option B. Flat hooves – This option is incorrect because hooves are hard coverings that protect the toes of ungulate animals (large mammals with hooves) such as horses, deer, cattle, or cattle. While many animals with hooves happen to be herbivores (e.g. horses, cattle, and deer), hooves themselves have nothing to do with the ability to digest plants, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option C. Long and sticky tongues – This option is incorrect because long and sticky tongues are not unique to herbivores. Instead, there are plenty of animals with long and sticky tongues who are not herbivores, such as chameleons, frogs, or pangolins. Long and sticky tongues allow a predator to reach its prey or food from a distance, but the presence of such structure does not indicate whether or not the animal is herbivore. While a long, sticky tongue could help a herbivore reach high leaves, it is not a defining feature of herbivores, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option D. Photosynthetic intestinal bacteria – This option is incorrect because the presence of photosynthetic bacteria in the intestines would not aid in the digestion of plants. Recall that photosynthesis requires direct sunlight in order to fuel the chemical reactions to synthesize glucose and ATP. Since no amount of sunlight reaches the intestine, it would be impossible for photosynthetic bacteria to survive and effectively perform photosynthesis.",

If a sperm cell and oocyte fuse to create a zygote, the mother’s reproductive system needs to be immediately ready to support it and nurture it. To be fully ready for implantation, the corpus luteum (formed after ovulation) begins producing progesterone and estrogen, which stimulate the endometrial tissue to thicken with nutrient-rich blood and the uterine lining to be receptive to the implantation of an embryo. The release of hCG is crucial to pregnancy and the early development of the embryo because it prevents the disintegration of the corpus luteum, which then prevents the shedding of the endometrium and therefore, provides the necessary blood supply for the implanted embryo to be supported and nurtured. The hCG hormone is released by the placenta only if pregnancy has occurred , which makes it an excellent target molecule for pregnancy tests. Therefore, Option E , hCG , is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. HGH – This option is incorrect because Human Growth Hormone (HGH) is not secreted in response to a pregnancy, and it is not the target molecule of pregnancy tests. Rather, HGH is produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. It plays crucial developmental functions in the body by stimulating bone growth and muscle development in all ages but especially children and adolescents. In adults, HGH helps maintain a physiologically healthy body composition and metabolism. While crucial in the development of the body, HGH is not associated with pregnancy; therefore, it cannot be used as a target molecule for pregnancy tests. Option B. Testosterone – This option is incorrect because testosterone is not associated with pregnancy. Instead, testosterone is primarily a male sex hormone that plays a crucial role in sperm production and secondary sex characteristics in males. While testosterone has a few limited functions in females, it is not associated with pregnancy, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option C. Cortisol – This option is incorrect because cortisol is not a marker for pregnancy. Cortisol plays an important role in regulating the body’s stress response as well as regulating metabolism. It is the body’s main stress hormone and is secreted by the adrenal glands of both males and females throughout their lives.  Therefore, cortisol cannot be used as a target molecule for pregnancy tests. Option D. Estrogen – This option is incorrect because estrogen is not an indication of pregnancy. Estrogen is a female sex hormone and has several crucial roles in the menstrual cycle and the overall sexual reproductive system in females. While pregnancy does induce a rise in estrogen levels, pregnancy is not the only time estrogen is present in the body. In fact, very often there is a detectable amount of estrogen in female urine (regardless of pregnancy status). Therefore, a pregnancy test that uses estrogen as a marker would cause countless false positive results.",

To achieve this, they use a multitude of communication methods – one of which is cell induction. Cell induction is the process of cells influencing the development of other adjacent cells by signaling a change in their gene expression. This occurs specifically during cell differentiation (i.e. stem cells becoming specialized). In other words, cell induction influences the fate of nearby cells. As shown in the figure below, this is usually carried out using a cell-signaling cascade using signaling vectors such as growth factors. The change in gene expression leads to the translation of different proteins, which in turn leads to a different set of functions, which ultimately leads to differentiation into a specialized cell. For example, during early embryonic development, the optic vesicle of the brain releases certain signaling molecules that travel to nearby cells. These molecules activate the expression of certain genes in those nearby cells, which eventually leads to the development of the optic lens. The optic vesicle just “induced” the development of lens cells. Remember, induction does not mean that the optic vesicle is turned into the lens of the eye. Rather, induction is the instruction of nearby cells to develop into a certain tissue or structure. Therefore, Option D , Induction , is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Transformation – This option is incorrect because transformation does not involve one cell directing the development of another cell. Instead, transformation is when a bacterial cell absorbs exogenous DNA from its surroundings and incorporates it internally. Transformation is very useful to bacteria because it can increase genetic diversity or introduce new traits such as antibiotic resistance. While transformation is a powerful way for bacterial cells to influence each other, it does not direct the development of a cell or group of cells, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option B. Transduction – This option is incorrect because transduction does not direct the development of a group of cells. Rather, transduction occurs when a bacteriophage virus transfers genetic material from one bacterium to another. The new cell now serves as a host cell and will be used to further spread the virus to more bacterial cells. Because this involves the sharing of genetic material between individuals who are not parent-offspring, it is referred to as horizontal gene transfer. While transduction can induce big changes in a cell’s function due to a virus, it does not induce a change in the development of another cell, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option C. Transcription– This option is incorrect because transcription is not a process that induces development in cells. Instead, transcription is the process by which DNA is used as a template to create a single strand of mRNA (messenger RNA). In eukaryotes, once the mRNA molecule is created, it is shuttled out of the nucleus and into the cytosol where translation can occur. Transcription does not direct the development of another cell; therefore, this answer option is incorrect. Option E. Conjugation – This option is incorrect because conjugation does not direct the development of another cell. During conjugation, bacteria transfer DNA between each other via a cytoplasmic bridge, known as a pili. This shared DNA is often in the form of a plasmid and can serve to spread beneficial traits such as antibiotic resistance.

      "concept_text": "The mitochondrion is a membrane-bound organelle found in almost all eukaryotic cells. Parts of the mitochondrion include the outer membrane, the inner membrane which has many cristae (folds), the intermembrane space, and the mitochondrial matrix (space enclosed by the inner membrane). Its main function is to generate ATP by being the site of several metabolic processes. If a mutation occurs and the mitochondria become dysfunctional, all of the processes occurring within the mitochondria will be affected. These processes include pyruvate oxidation (occurs in the matrix), the citric acid cycle (occurs in the matrix), the electron transport chain (embedded in the inner membrane), and oxidative phosphorylation (occurs in the intermembrane space and inner membrane). The only process of cellular respiration that does not occur within the mitochondria is glycolysis and hence, will not be affected if the mitochondria become dysfunctional. As seen in the figure below, glycolysis is the catalysis of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, which yields a net gain of 2 molecules of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation and occurs in the cytosol of the eukaryotic cell – independent of the mitochondria. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is Option B , Glycolysis .",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Pyruvate oxidation – This option is incorrect because pyruvate oxidation occurs inside the mitochondrion, therefore, a dysfunctional mitochondrion would be unable to carry out this process. After pyruvate is produced by glycolysis, it enters the mitochondrion and is converted to acetyl CoA via pyruvate oxidation. Acetyl CoA then enters the Citric Acid Cycle and continues facilitating the production of ATP. In general terms, pyruvate oxidation links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle, and occurs inside the mitochondrial matrix, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option C. Citric acid cycle – This option is incorrect because the citric acid cycle (a.k.a. Krebs Cycle) occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. A dysfunctional mitochondrion would be unable to carry out this process. After pyruvate enters the mitochondrion, it is converted into acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA then enters the Citric Acid Cycle to be broken down and form CO 2 , ATP, NADH, and FADH 2 . The electron carriers NADH and FADH 2 will then shuttle electrons to the electron transport chain to power ATP production. Because the Citric Acid Cycle cannot occur without fully functioning mitochondria, this answer option is incorrect. Option D. Electron transport chain – This option is incorrect because the electron transport chain (ETC) is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, therefore, it cannot occur if mitochondria are dysfunctional. As seen in the figure above, the ETC is responsible for the majority of ATP production in aerobic respiration (approximately 32 ATP molecules). The ETC begins with NADH and FADH 2 donating electrons to cytochromes (protein carriers) embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The electrons are then passed down a series of protein complexes to create a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The potential energy harvested from these electrons moving to progressively lower free energy levels is later coupled with ATP synthase enzymes to produce ATP. Since the electron transport chain is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, this process cannot occur without fully functioning mitochondria, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option E. Oxidative phosphorylation – This option is incorrect because oxidative phosphorylation takes place inside mitochondria. Oxidative phosphorylation is the synthesis of ATP using the energy harvested from the redox reactions in the electron transport chain. This is unlike substrate-level phosphorylation (used by glycolysis), which directly generates ATP by having an enzyme transfer a substrate’s phosphate group to an ADP molecule. Since oxidative phosphorylation depends on the electron transport chain and occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane, it cannot occur in dysfunctional mitochondria, which makes this answer option incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "Before we tackle the specifics of this question, it is useful to take a zoomed-out view first. Recall that all eukaryotes fall into one of four kingdoms: Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia . The kingdom Animalia (animals) is further categorized in the phyla listed below: Organisms from the phyla Cnidaria and Echinodermata are the only two phyla that display radial symmetry; that is, their body parts are arranged around a central axis. In contrast, all other phyla have bilateral symmetry – except for the phylum Porifera, which is asymmetrical . Therefore, Option A , Echinodermata , is the correct answer. Examples of Phylum Echinodermata include starfish and sea urchins. The general shape and body parts of these animals are symmetrically divided in half along many different lines that pass through their central point, like dividing a pizza in half. The illustration below depicts this concept. For the test, you should memorize all the animal phyla in the list above, along with their respective characteristics. This question tests your knowledge of body plan symmetry (i.e. asymmetrical vs radial vs bilateral); however, you are just as likely to be asked about tissue organization (i.e. diploblast vs triploblast), coelom formation (i.e. acoelomate vs pseudocoelomate vs true coelomate), or embryonic development (i.e. protostome vs deuterostome). To see a detailed comparison between all the animal phyla and their corresponding characteristics, please refer to the Animalia Phyla Study Sheet . CC BY 4.0",

Furthermore, Arthropoda have coelomate bodies, a chitin exoskeleton, and multiple pairs of jointed appendages. Having more species than all other animal phyla combined, Arthropoda is the largest animal phylum (around 85 percent of all animals are arthropods) and includes spiders, insects, and crustaceans. Option C. Mollusca – This option is incorrect because they do not exhibit radial symmetry; rather, Mollusca exhibit bilateral symmetry. Mollusks have coelomate bodies, complete digestive tracts, and usually have open circulatory systems with an internal cavity called the hemocoel. A few examples of mollusks are snails, octopuses, squids, and bivalves. Option D. Porifera – This option is incorrect because Porifera exhibit an asymmetrical body plan. Porifera are more commonly known as sponges, and they are the oldest animal phylum. They feed by filtering water through their sponge walls, and they are capable of reproducing both sexually and asexually. Porifera are commonly used in the production of antibiotic medication because they host a diverse range of bacteria. Option E. Rotifera – This option is incorrect because they do not exhibit radial symmetry; instead, Rotifera exhibit bilateral symmetry. Rotifera are filter feeders, have a pseudocoelom, and are capable of parthenogenesis – a type of asexual reproduction.",

      "concept_text": "Ozone is a molecule with the formula O 3 (three oxygen atoms linked together). The ozone layer is a section of the earth’s atmosphere where ozone molecules are found in relatively high concentration, and it is crucial to life as we know it because it absorbs most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation . Depletion of the ozone layer would lead to catastrophic consequences for most organisms on Earth. The only organisms that would remain largely unaffected are extremophiles, due to their high tolerance to extreme conditions like high UV radiation, high salinity, or extremely high & low temperatures. In fact, this is what the first form of life on earth looked like billions of years ago. Let us go over a timeline of Earth’s development to help us tackle this question: In summary, around 2.5 billion years ago some prokaryotes developed the ability to perform photosynthesis, which classified them as autotrophs. Through photosynthesis, these autotrophic prokaryotes released oxygen into Earth’s atmosphere, which eventually led to the Great Oxidation Event and, subsequently, the creation of the ozone layer. Therefore, Option A , Autotrophic prokaryotes , is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Anaerobic eukaryotes – This option is incorrect because the ozone layer was formed by a certain type of prokaryotes – note eukaryotes. Specifically, it was formed by cyanobacteria. In addition, eukaryotes are believed to have appeared after the oxygenation of the Earth’s atmosphere. Once formed, the ozone layer absorbed a significant portion of UV radiation entering the atmosphere, which converted the previously hostile conditions into much more hospitable habitats, thus allowing new life to appear, likely including eukaryotes. Option C. Sponges – This option is incorrect because sponges appeared long after the creation of the ozone layer (at least two billion years later). Sponges are eukaryotes and are members of the kingdom Animalia and the phylum Porifera, which could not have formed before the protection provided by the ozone layer, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option D. Heterotrophic eukaryotes – This option is incorrect because heterotrophs , by definition, are incapable of producing their own food; they obtain energy by consuming organic matter. Since oxygen is produced by autotrophs performing photosynthesis, heterotrophs could not have been responsible for the creation of the ozone layer. Moreover, all eukaryotes (including heterotrophic eukaryotes) are believed to have appeared after the creation of the ozone layer due to the protection it provided from UV radiation. Option E. Fungi – This option is incorrect because fungi are heterotrophs and they do not produce oxygen as a byproduct of their metabolism. Recall that heterotrophs are incapable of producing their own food. Since oxygen is produced by autotrophs performing photosynthesis, heterotrophs could not have been responsible for the creation of the ozone layer.

      "concept_text": "Proteins are polypeptides that can have up to four levels of structure: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. The primary structure is composed of a linear series of amino acids linked together via peptide bonds (hence the term poly peptide ). The secondary structure is composed of polypeptides that are bent into alpha helices and beta-pleated sheets . As shown in the image below, this morphing of the polypeptide into a 3D shape is made possible by hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygen and amino hydrogen of nearby amino acids. The tertiary structure is the 3D structure formed primarily due to interactions between amino acid R groups such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, Van der Waals forces, ionic bonding, and disulfide bonds. Lastly, the quaternary structure is a group of two or more separate peptide chains being held together by interactions similar to those in tertiary structures. Because alpha helices and beta-pleated sheets are a direct result of hydrogen bonding, the correct answer is Option D , Hydrogen bonding . Note: Denaturation refers to the disruption or complete destruction of the interactions between secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures only – denaturation does not affect the peptide bonds of the primary structure, but it does render the protein non-functional. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Ionic bonding – This option is incorrect because ionic bonds do not contribute to primary structures of proteins – instead, they play an important role in tertiary and quaternary structures. Ionic bonds are a result of oppositely charged side chains coming into close contact. For example, an ionic bond can form between a positively charged lysine and a negatively charged aspartic acid. These interactions help to stabilize the folded shape of the protein (tertiary structure) and can be important in the assembly of multi-subunit proteins (quaternary structure). Option B. Disulfide bonds – This option is incorrect because disulfide bonds do not contribute to primary structures. Rather, disulfide bonds are observed in tertiary and quaternary structures as they are interactions between side chains of amino acids (R groups). Specifically, cysteine is the only amino acid that forms disulfide bonds. Although tertiary structures are held together by non-covalent interactions, disulfide bonds are an exception and are considered covalent bonds. As such, they offer a relatively strong linkage between cysteine groups and firmly hold the 3D shape of the tertiary structure. Option C. Hydrophobic effect – This option is incorrect because this is mostly observed in tertiary and quaternary structures since the hydrophobic effect is considered to be an interaction between side chains of amino acids. Due to the aqueous nature of the cytoplasm surrounding proteins, tertiary structures fold in a way that clusters the hydrophobic side chains together in the core of the structure, minimizing exposure to water. Option E. – This option is incorrect because it is actually non-covalent interactions that form alpha helices and beta-pleated sheets. Recall that a covalent bond involves the equal sharing of an electron pair between two atoms (e.g. in an H 2 molecule, two hydrogen atoms form a covalent bond by sharing a pair of electrons). In contrast, alpha helices and beta-pleated sheets are formed through hydrogen bonding , which is a type of non-covalent interaction. Hydrogen bonding occurs between the partially positively charged hydrogen of one molecule and the partially negatively charged electronegative atom (N, O, or F) of a different molecule.",

      "concept_text": "ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy currency of living cells, and it powers countless biochemical pathways in nature. Three common methods for ATP production are cellular respiration, substrate-level phosphorylation, and photosynthesis. The highest ATP yield is achieved by cellular respiration , which is made up of distinct biochemical pathways and processes. Cellular respiration breaks down glucose molecules to generate ATP. The breakdown of glucose begins with glycolysis, which occurs in the cell cytoplasm. Glycolysis uses substrate-level phosphorylation to produce a net gain of 2 ATP molecules, two pyruvate molecules, and two NADH. Each pyruvate molecule enters the mitochondrion and undergoes pyruvate oxidation to be converted into acetyl-CoA (acetyl coenzyme A). Each acetyl-CoA then enters the Citric Acid Cycle (a.k.a. Krebs cycle ) which involves a series of biochemical steps to produce one ATP, three NADH, and one FADH 2 (high-energy electron carriers). However, keep in mind that two pyruvates are produced per one glucose molecule, therefore, the ATP output of the Krebs cycle per glucose molecule is 2 ATP . The high-energy electron carriers are then used to power the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) which is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The ETC creates a proton gradient that drives ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation, yielding 32 ATP molecules (majority of ATP in cellular respiration). In summary, glycolysis yields 2 ATP, the Krebs cycle yields 2 ATP, and the Electron Transport Chain yields 32 ATP per molecule of glucose. Therefore, Option D , Electron Transport Chain , is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Glycolysis – This option is incorrect because glycolysis produces much fewer ATP molecules when compared to the Electron Transport Chain (two ATP vs 32 ATP, respectively). Glycolysis can be viewed as having an “energy investment” and an “energy payoff” phase. The investment pathway requires 2 ATP molecules to be carried out, however, the subsequent payoff pathway generates a total of four ATP molecules, bringing the net gain from glycolysis to 2 ATP molecules. Option B. Krebs cycle – This option is incorrect because the Krebs cycle produces much fewer ATP molecules when compared to the Electron Transport Chain (two ATP vs 32 ATP, respectively). Although the Krebs cycle produces some ATP, this is not the primary role of this pathway. Rather the Krebs cycle primarily serves to generate high-energy electron carriers (NADH and FADH 2 ) to carry high-energy electrons to the electron transport chain. Option C. Fermentation – This option is incorrect because fermentation does not produce any ATP. Rather, the purpose of fermentation is the oxidation of NADH to regenerate NAD+. As glycolysis occurs, the cell’s supply of NAD+ is eventually converted to NADH. For glycolysis to be able to continue when no oxygen is available, the NAD+ must be regenerated through a method other than aerobic cellular respiration. Fermentation converts NADH back into NAD+, allowing glycolysis to continue even in anaerobic conditions. Option E. Cori cycle – This option is incorrect because the Cori cycle does not directly produce ATP. Instead, the primary function of the Cori cycle is to recycle lactate produced by muscles during anaerobic conditions. The Cori cycle occurs in the liver, and it converts lactate back into glucose, which can be sent to energy-hungry muscles and tissues. Not only does the Cori cycle not produce any ATP, but it consumes ATP to carry out its functions.",

The cells starting meiosis are called primary oocytes. These cells will begin the first meiotic division, but their progress is arrested in prophase I of meiosis. Therefore, Option B , Prophase I of meiosis , is the correct answer. The primary oocytes gather in the ovary and at the time of birth, all future eggs are in the prophase stage. Upon reaching puberty, hormonal signals trigger one primary oocyte per cycle to resume meiosis and develop into a secondary oocyte. The secondary oocyte begins meiosis II but is arrested again at metaphase II. If fertilization occurs, meiosis II goes on to completion. Below is an illustration to help visualize this concept. Note the number of chromosomes sets along each stage (1n vs 2n). Females are born with oocytes that are 2n because meiosis I has not gone to completion yet. It is only after the completion of meiosis that the diploid primary oocyte becomes a haploid secondary oocyte. CC BY 4.0",

It is only after puberty that meiosis continues to form a haploid secondary oocyte and a polar body. A meiotic arrest occurs, this time at the metaphase II stage. If the secondary oocyte is fertilized, the cell continues through meiosis II, completing meiosis, producing a second polar body and a haploid ovum, which fuses with the sperm nucleus to form the diploid zygote. Option C. Prophase of mitosis – This option is incorrect because gametogenesis is the production of sperm (spermatogenesis) and eggs (oogenesis) through the process of meiosis, not mitosis. Recall that mitosis gives rise to diploid cells that are genetically identical, whereas meiosis gives rise to haploid cells (gametes) that are genetically unique. The purpose of reproduction is to give rise to a genetically unique and diverse offspring; therefore, proper function of meiosis is crucial. Option D. Metaphase I of meiosis – This option is incorrect because oogenesis is arrested at prophase I at birth, resulting in a diploid primary oocyte. After puberty, meiosis continues, to form a haploid secondary oocyte and a polar body. A meiotic arrest occurs, this time at the metaphase II stage. If the secondary oocyte is fertilized, the cell continues through meiosis II, completing meiosis, producing a second polar body and a haploid ovum, which fuses with the sperm nucleus to form the diploid zygote. Option E. Metaphase II of meiosis – This option is incorrect because oogenesis is arrested at prophase I at birth, resulting in a diploid primary oocyte. The eggs are arrested at metaphase II of meiosis only after puberty. Once puberty has begun, meiosis continues, to form a haploid secondary oocyte and a polar body. A meiotic arrest occurs, this time at the metaphase II stage. If the secondary oocyte is fertilized, the cell continues through meiosis II, completing meiosis, producing a second polar body and a haploid ovum, which fuses with the sperm nucleus to form the diploid zygote.",

      "concept_text": "All life on earth falls under one of three domains : Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. These three domains are further subdivided into six kingdoms : Eubacteria (bacteria), Archaebacteria (Archaea), Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia. This question is testing your knowledge of the six kingdoms of life and their characteristics. For the test, it is important to know the general characteristics of each of the six kingdoms, outlined in the table below. The question mentions that the organism of interest is plant-like , unicellular , and with a nucleus . To answer this question let us look at the three properties individually and find the answer option that matches the description best. CC BY 4.0 In summary, Protista is a group of eukaryotic and unicellular organisms. They have a nucleus that is surrounded by a nuclear envelope. Additionally, some protists are plant-like and can perform photosynthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is Option D. Protista .",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Animalia – This option is incorrect because all organisms of the class Animalia are, by definition, multicellular and heterotrophic. In contrast, the organism mentioned in the question is unicellular and plant-like (i.e. heterotrophic). Option B. Plantae – This option is incorrect because all plants are, by definition, multicellular organisms. In contrast, the organism mentioned in the question is unicellular. While there are some unicellular organisms that can perform photosynthesis (e.g. algae), these organisms belong to the kingdom Protista – not Plantae. Option C. Monera – This option is incorrect because Monera are unicellular organisms that do not have nuclei. You may have noticed that Monera is not one of the six kingdoms listed in the table above. An older method of classification used to group kingdom Bacteria and kingdom Archaea together as the kingdom Monera (essentially all prokaryotes) because of some similarities such as the lack of membrane-bound organelles. However, further taxonomic research revealed that Bacteria and Archaea are fairly different; therefore, the kingdom Monera was dropped and split into the kingdoms of Eubacteria (bacteria) and Archaebacteria (Archaea). Option E. Fungi – This option is incorrect because fungi are not plant-like. Fungi can exist as either unicellular or multicellular organisms. However, one of the defining characteristics of fungi is that they are heterotrophs. That is, they cannot produce their own food (through processes such as photosynthesis) and, instead, must consume other organisms to obtain nutrients.",

      "concept_text": "As the functional unit of the lungs, alveoli are the tiny air sacs where gas exchange occurs with overlying capillaries. Because alveoli are spherical in shape and lined with water, the surface tension on the water-air interface produces a large force acting inward that can “collapse” the sacks, which would render them unusable, as seen in the figure below. To prevent this, healthy individuals have a layer of surfactant that coats the inner surface of the alveoli.  Surfactant is a phospholipid-rich substance produced by Type II alveolar cells and functions to reduce the surface tension in the alveoli. There is much less surface tension in the surfactant-air interface when compared to the water-air interface. Hence, the tendency for alveoli to collapse inward is significantly reduced with a lining of surfactant. Therefore, Option C. Collapsed alveoli , is the correct answer to this question. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Decreased metabolism – This option is incorrect because an individual's metabolism (or rate of metabolism) is not directly affected by the presence or absence of surfactant. Instead, one of the most common direct causes of decreased metabolism is hypothyroidism, which involves the under-secretion of T3 and T4 hormones. In healthy individuals, the secretion levels of T3 and T4 are in a healthy balance with the rest of the biochemical needs of the body, and these hormones function to increase the metabolic rate. In the case of under-secretion of these hormones, the consequences will likely include a decreased metabolism, weight gain, fatigue, and sensitivity to cold. Option B. Lack of stomach mucus – This option is incorrect because an individual's ability to produce stomach mucus is not directly affected by the presence or absence of surfactant. Instead, lack of stomach mucus would be the result of dysfunctional mucous cells. These cells are located in the lining of the stomach, and they excrete a consistent supply of mucus that lubricates and protects the stomach lining from the acidic environment. However, the presence of surfactant is not directly affected or regulated by stomach mucus, as it is an entirely separate substance found in a different area of the body. Option D. Lower bone calcium – This option is incorrect because an individual's bone calcium levels are not directly affected by the presence or absence of surfactant. Recall that bone calcium and blood calcium levels are both regulated by the hormones calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Calcitonin lowers blood calcium levels and raises bone calcium by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts (cells that break down bone to release calcium). In contrast, PTH raises blood calcium and lowers bone calcium by stimulating osteoclast activity. Therefore, lower bone calcium would not be caused by a lack of surfactant, rather it would be directly caused by low calcitonin levels or high PTH levels. Option E. Reduced night vision – This option is incorrect because an individual's night vision is not directly affected by the presence or absence of surfactant. Instead, night vision (i.e. the ability to see in low-light environments) is driven by rod cells in the eye. The two types of photoreceptors found in the retina of the eyes are rod cells and cone cells. Rods function in environments with little light and cones function in environments with lots of light to transmit color and sharp images. Use the mnemonic “C for Color” to remember the difference. Therefore, reduced night vision would not be caused by a lack of surfactant, rather it would be directly caused by a lack of or dysfunction of the rod cells in the eye’s retina.",

      "concept_text": "First, let us recall the difference between genes vs alleles. A gene is a stretch of DNA that codes for a trait or characteristic, whereas an allele codes for the specific variant of that trait. For example, two siblings both have the gene for eye color, however, one has the “green” allele while the other has the “brown” allele. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, each carrying one allele from the father and one allele from the mother. The first 22 pairs are called autosomal chromosomes , and they influence almost the entire body except for sexual development. The 23 rd pair are the sex chromosomes (X and Y), which determine biological sex and drive sexual development. Since the question presents an autosomal scenario, we know that it does not involve the sex chromosomes, therefore, biological sex will be irrelevant in the inheritance of this specific condition. Therefore, Options A and B are incorrect. Dominant vs recessive refers to how alleles interact with each other to determine the phenotype being expressed by the organism. A dominant allele will express its corresponding trait even if there is only one copy of the allele present. In contrast, a recessive allele is expressed only if two copies of the allele are present. Dominant alleles “mask” or “overrule” the expression of a recessive allele when paired together. A homozygous individual carries two identical alleles (e.g. AA or aa). A heterozygous individual carries two different alleles (e.g. Aa). If a condition is autosomal recessive , as mentioned in the question, then both alleles must be recessive for the condition to be expressed (e.g. aa). A heterozygote individual cannot be affected by an autosomal recessive condition because both alleles need to be in the recessive form, but heterozygotes carry two different alleles. Therefore, Option E , Heterozygotes will not be affected by the condition , is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Males will have the condition more often – This option is incorrect because biological sex is irrelevant in the inheritance of autosomal conditions. Recall that only sex-linked conditions are affected by sex. If a condition is said to be “autosomal” like the example in this question, then, by definition, the condition is not sex-linked because autosomal refers to the first 22 chromosomes (which are not the sex chromosomes X & Y). As such, a person’s sex does not influence the chances of being affected by an autosomal recessive condition. Option B. Females will have the condition more often – This option is incorrect because biological sex is irrelevant in the inheritance of autosomal conditions. Recall that only sex-linked conditions are affected by sex. If a condition is said to be “autosomal” like the example in this question, then, by definition, the condition is not sex-linked because autosomal refers to the first 22 chromosomes (which are not the sex chromosomes X & Y). As such, a person’s sex does not influence the chances of being affected by an autosomal recessive condition. Option C. Homozygous dominant individuals will be affected by the condition – This option is incorrect because a homozygous dominant individual will not carry any of the alleles responsible for the condition. Recall that the condition in question is autosomal recessive. Therefore, only individuals carrying two recessive alleles will be affected by the condition (e.g. aa). In contrast, homozygous dominant individuals carry none of the affected alleles (e.g. AA). Option D. Two unaffected parents cannot have an affected child – This option is incorrect because two unaffected parents could indeed have an affected child. If an individual is unaffected, then there are two possible explanations regarding the genotype: either the individual is homozygous dominant (e.g. AA) or heterozygous (e.g. Aa). A carrier of a condition is a heterozygous individual that carries the recessive allele for a condition but is not affected because the expression of the recessive allele is masked by the dominant allele. If two carriers reproduce (Aa x Aa), there is a 25% chance that their offspring is affected by the autosomal recessive condition (Punnett square results in 1 out of 4 being the “aa” genotype).",

      "concept_text": "This question refers to a genetic engineering technique where scientists insert segments of eukaryotic cDNA (complementary DNA) into prokaryotic cells (such as bacteria) for them to transcribe and translate into proteins. What makes this a powerful technique, and the reason it is the preferred method, is that prokaryotes lack introns , which are the non-coding segments of DNA found in eukaryotic DNA. Recall that, in eukaryotes, DNA is composed of coding segments (exons) and non-coding segments (introns), as seen in the figure below. A useful mnemonic is: E xons = E xpressed  vs I ntrons = I n between. This lack of intros is one of the reasons why in prokaryotes, transcription and translation can occur simultaneously. That is, as RNA Polymerase moves along the DNA strand transcribing the mRNA, ribosomes can immediately start attaching to that emerging mRNA. This makes overall DNA expression in prokaryotes simpler and faster than in eukaryotes and makes it a favorable technique in genetic engineering. Therefore, Option B , Prokaryotic genes lack introns , is the correct answer. It should be noted that for a prokaryote to express eukaryotic DNA, one major obstacle needs to be addressed first: since prokaryotes lack introns, they also lack the cell machinery that performs splicing (removal of non-coding segments). Therefore, a prokaryote would be unable to translate functional proteins if given a DNA strand with introns. To avoid this, before delivering the DNA strand to a prokaryote, scientists remove all non-coding segments from the strand of interest to create a cDNA strand (complementary DNA). This way, no splicing needs to be performed by the prokaryote. Likewise, it is simpler to use a prokaryotic vector rather than a eukaryotic one for expression of the cDNA because there is no risk of prokaryotes attempting to modify the mRNA transcript (in a eukaryotic vector, post-transcriptional and post-translational modification could end up altering the final desired product).",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Prokaryotes have different compartments for their post-translational modification – This option is incorrect because prokaryotes lack compartmentalization Remember that prokaryotes, by definition, lack membrane-bound organelles such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, or Golgi apparatus. Because prokaryotes do not have a nuclear membrane to separate transcription from translation (as seen in eukaryotes), transcription and translation in prokaryotes occur simultaneously in the cytoplasm (as RNA polymerase moves along the DNA strand transcribing DNA into mRNA, ribosomes can immediately start attaching to that emerging mRNA and begin translation). Option C. Eukaryotic genes are more easily identified with prokaryotic promoters – This option is incorrect. The decision to use prokaryotes to express eukaryotic DNA has nothing to do with promoter regions. A promoter is a region of a DNA strand that attracts RNA polymerase to attach and begin transcription. While promoters are a crucial part of gene expression in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, they are not the reason prokaryotes are used for eukaryotic gene expression, which makes this answer option incorrect. Rather, the main benefit of using prokaryotes is their reliability in gene expression, which is a result of the lack of introns. Prokaryotes do not perform splicing, and therefore, they do not run the risk of invertedly making inaccurate alterations to the final product through splicing. Option D. Prokaryotic ribosomes are able to move faster due to their smaller size – This option is incorrect because this is not a benefit of using prokaryotic gene expression. While it is true that prokaryotic ribosomes are smaller, and it is also true that prokaryotic gene expression as a whole is faster than in eukaryotes, this difference in speed is not caused by the smaller size of prokaryotic ribosomes. Rather, the reason prokaryotic gene expression is faster is because of the coupling of transcription and translation made possible by the lack of nuclear membrane (lack of compartmentalization). Furthermore, the reason prokaryotic cells are preferred for eukaryotic gene expression is not for speed, but for reliability of expressing the final gene product. Option E. Prokaryotic nuclei have more efficient transcription factors – This option is incorrect because prokaryotes do not have nuclei. Recall that one of the defining characteristics of prokaryotes is the lack of membrane-bound organelles such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or mitochondria. This answer option incorrectly suggests that prokaryotes have nuclei. Moreover, this answer option also suggests that transcription factors are more efficiently used by prokaryotes, which is incorrect. In reality, transcription factors are much more commonly used by eukaryotes due to the higher degree of gene expression and regulation seen in eukaryotic gene expression. On the other hand, prokaryotes rely much more on operons to regulate their gene expression. An operon is a cluster of genes that control transcription and consist of promoter, operator, and structural genes.",

      "concept_text": "Incomplete dominance is a form of intermediate inheritance; that is, a type of inheritance in which the alleles from each parent blend together to form a “mixed” or “blended” phenotype in the offspring. This may occur if the two alleles are equally dominant to each other, resulting in a scenario where neither allele can be fully dominant over the other. In the example below, when a red -colored flower (genotype C R C R ) and a white -colored flower (genotype C W C W ) breed and produce a heterozygous offspring that has pink -colored flowers (genotype C R C W ). This trait is a combination of the phenotypes of both alleles. In incomplete dominance, one allele for a specific trait is not completely expressed over its paired allele. Therefore, Option C , Incomplete dominance , is the correct answer. Here is a visualization of this concept: CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Polygenic inheritance - This option is incorrect because polygenic inheritance is not the expression of an intermediate or “blended ” phenotype (as seen in the example above). Instead, polygenic inheritance is the interaction of many genes to shape a single phenotype with continuous variation such as height, skin color, or hair color. Polygenic inheritance can be described as the opposite of pleiotropy, where one gene affects multiple phenotypes. Option B. Complete dominance - This option is incorrect because complete dominance occurs when the dominant allele completely masks the effect of the recessive allele. In the question above, neither phenotype (red vs white) completely masks the other, which makes this answer option incorrect. Most examples of inheritance you are initially exposed to while learning the basics of genetics involve complete dominance. That is, the offspring exhibit only one dominant allele that completely overrides the phenotype of the recessive allele. This is known as simple Mendelian inheritance because this pattern was first described in detail by Gregor Mendel. Option D. Pleiotropy - This option is incorrect because pleiotropy occurs when a single gene affects multiple, seemingly unrelated features or aspects of an organism’s phenotype. For example, sickle cell anemia is the result of only one gene mutation, however, it has numerous consequences on an individual's phenotype beyond anemia, such as organ damage, frequent infections, vision issues, and increased stroke risk. Pleiotropy can be described as the opposite of polygenic inheritance; in polygenic inheritance, multiple genes affect one phenotype (e.g. multiple genes together determine someone’s height). Option E. Co-Dominance - This option is incorrect . In co-dominance, both alleles in the genotype are seen in the phenotype simultaneously (in this example, the flower would have patches of red and white color if there was co-dominance). However, in incomplete dominance, a mixture or “blend” of the alleles in the genotype is seen in the phenotype (pink flowers). Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "Rods are a type of photoreceptors within the retina that are necessary for night vision and vision in dimmer lighting. They mainly occupy the outer edges of the retina. Rod cells contain pigments called rhodopsin , which undergo chemical change when exposed to light rays and cause these photoreceptor cells to signal bipolar cells near the retina, which then send signals to the brain through the optic nerve. Therefore, a defect in rod cells would impair the ability to see in dim (low) lighting. As such, Option A , Inability to see dim light , is the correct answer. Rod cells are commonly confused with cone cells , which are the other type of photoreceptors, responsible for transmitting color vision and sharp images.

Moreover, cone cells allow us to focus on fine details and provide our sharpest central vision. Option C. Inability to see in bright light – This option is incorrect . Although rods are very light-sensitive, it would be less likely for damaged rods to show poor performance in environments with bright light compared to dim lighting. Rod cells are responsible for processing dimly lit environments. They contain a photopigment called rhodopsin, which is incredibly sensitive to even tiny amounts of light. Therefore, rod cells are specialized in night vision and any damage to rod cells would hinder vision in dark environments, not bright ones. Option D. Inability to see far distances – This option is incorrect because this would occur because of a lens defect/suboptimal eye shape. This is called myopia and occurs when the lens is too strong, which causes the light rays to focus in front of the retina. This is also called short-sightedness because you can clearly see objects that are within a short distance. Option E. Inability to see near distances – This option is incorrect because this would occur because of a lens defect/suboptimal eye shape. This is called hyperopia and occurs when the lens is too weak, which causes the light rays to focus slightly behind the retina.

      "concept_text": "In eukaryotic cells, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle) occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, as shown in the image below. In contrast, prokaryotic cells lack mitochondria and carry out the Krebs cycle in the cytosol. Therefore, Option D , Mitochondrial matrix , is the correct answer. The Krebs cycle is a biochemical pathway that serves as a crucial step of cellular respiration in any organism that uses oxygen to produce energy. Cellular respiration breaks down glucose molecules to generate ATP. To achieve this, the breakdown of glucose begins with glycolysis, which occurs in the cell cytoplasm. Glycolysis uses substrate-level phosphorylation to produce a net gain of 2 ATP molecules, two pyruvate molecules, and two NADH. Each pyruvate molecule enters the mitochondria and undergoes pyruvate oxidation to be converted into acetyl-CoA (acetyl coenzyme A). Each acetyl-CoA then enters the Krebs cycle , and the net result is one ATP, three NADH, and one FADH 2 (high-energy electron carriers). These high-energy electron carriers shuttle high-energy electrons to the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) which is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The ETC creates a proton gradient that drives ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation, yielding roughly 32 ATP molecules (the majority of ATP in cellular respiration). CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Plasma membrane – This option is incorrect because the Krebs cycle takes place in the mitochondrial matrix. Moreover, neither of the two membranes of the mitochondrion is referred to as a “plasma membrane”. Because of the mitochondrion’s unique double-membrane composition, the mitochondrial membranes are referred to as the “inner” and “outer” membranes. Regardless, neither of these two membranes hosts the Krebs cycle, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option B. Mitochondrial inner membrane – This option is incorrect because it is actually the Electron Transport Chain – not the Krebs cycle – that is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The Krebs cycle takes place in the mitochondrial matrix. The Electron Transport Chain (ETC) is a crucial component of cellular respiration because this is where oxidative phosphorylation occurs. As electrons move through the protein complexes of the ETC, a proton gradient is formed in the inner mitochondrial matrix. It is this proton gradient that drives ATP synthase, the enzyme that ultimately produces the majority of ATP in cellular respiration. Option C. Cytoplasm – This option is incorrect because the Krebs cycle does not take place in the cytoplasm; the Krebs cycle takes place in the mitochondrial matrix. This is likely the result of the mitochondrion’s history as a once independent energy-producing organism (recall endosymbiotic theory). If the Krebs cycle occurred in the cytoplasm (outside the mitochondrion), then the Electron Transport Chain (inside the mitochondrion) would not receive enough high-energy electron carriers to carry out oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis and fermentation are the two main energy-producing processes that take place in the cytoplasm. Option E. Mitochondrial inter-membrane space – This option is incorrect because the Krebs cycle takes place in the mitochondrial matrix and not in the inter-membrane space. The inter-membrane space is the narrow region between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Its main function is to maintain the proton gradient that drives oxidative phosphorylation and, ultimately, the production of ATP (the “end goal” of cellular respiration).",

    "explanation": {
      "concept_text": "Evolution selects for genetic success; therefore, an organism’s structure, function, and overall behavior are rooted in increasing the possibility of its genes being passed down to the next generation. But how this “goal” is achieved by an organism can vary. Throughout evolution, two main “techniques” have emerged: (1) produce as many offspring as possible while maintaining minimal parental investment into each offspring or (2) produce a low number of offspring but dedicate large amounts of time and energy in maintaining high parental investment for each offspring. Both strategies have proven very successful in an evolutionary context. The difference between them can be distinctly seen in their survivorship curve (a graph that visualizes the proportion of individuals surviving early, middle, and old age). As seen in the figure below, a Type I survivorship curve is characterized by a high rate of survival in early and middle age but sees a steep increase in deaths in old age (that is, most individuals live to old age, after which mortality rates increase dramatically). Type II survivorship curve sees constant mortality rates throughout all ages, and lastly, Type III survivorship curve has high mortality rates in early age, but later plateaus following an exponential decay curve. In other words, species that follow a Type III curve have a high death rate early in life, but those individuals lucky enough to survive that initial period have a good chance of living a long time. R-selected species produce many offspring and dedicate minimal parental investment (e.g. frogs, fish, and rabbits). As a result, most of the offspring die at an early age, therefore, R-selected species exhibit a Type III curve . In contrast, K-selected species produce few offspring and invest more time and resources into each offspring (e.g. humans, elephants, and kangaroos). Because only a few offspring were produced, parental investment can be maintained high, which allows most of the population to survive to old age, after which deaths rapidly increase due to natural causes. Therefore, K-selected species exhibit a Type I survivorship curve. A useful mnemonic to remember the difference is that R ats are R -selected vs K angaroos are K -selected. Since most humans live to old age, at which point death rates rapidly increase, Option D, K-selected species is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Ecological succession – This option is incorrect because ecological succession describes how one community is gradually replaced by another group of species; this does not relate to the survivorship curve of a population. The original scenario posed by the question refers to the recurring trend (Type I survivorship) seen in human populations. In contrast, ecological succession occurs only in instances of significant disturbance in a community such as wildfire, hurricane, or flood. Option B. Stabilizing selection – This option is incorrect because stabilizing selection does not dictate the age at which humans die. Stabilizing selection describes the tendency of intermediate values in a population to be favored over extreme values, forming a bell curve. For example, a new virus kills individuals who are extremely short and extremely tall in a population, while those who are closer to the mean are more likely to survive. This event is considered “stabilizing” because it “selects” for the mean value (closer to the peak of the bell curve). few other types of selection are Directional, Industrial, and Disruptive selection. Option C. R-selected species – This option is incorrect because R-selected species experience the opposite of what is being described in the question. R-selected species experience a Type III survivorship curve, which is characterized by a rapid rate of mortality in the population in early age, which later plateaus in an exponential decay curve. This is a result of minimal parental investment (less attention, care, and resources being invested into each offspring inevitably leads to higher mortality rates). Remember that this is “by design” and is the way with which the population dynamics of such organisms have evolved. Although there is a very steep decline in population in early age, the few individuals that survive are enough to reproduce and keep the lineage alive. In contrast, human populations follow a Type I survivorship curve, characterized by a high rate of survival in early and middle age, followed by a steep increase in deaths in old age. Option E. Cell differentiation – This option is incorrect because cell differentiation is unrelated to the survivorship trends of a population. Cell differentiation is the process by which stem cells become specialized to perform specific functions in a multicellular organism. For example, muscle cells contract to provide movement, nerve cells transmit electrical signals for communication, red blood cells carry oxygen, and skin cells form a protective barrier from the outside world; all these cells originated from stem cells that underwent differentiation. It is important to remember that during cell differentiation, the cell still retains its full original genome. Cells differentiate and “specialize” as a result of the select set of genes they express and not because the genome itself has been changed.",

Therefore, Option C , Dorsal solid nerve cord is the exception, which makes it the correct answer. Because it is hollow, the nerve cord acts as a “tube” that holds the spinal cord and fills up with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) early in development. CSF is crucial to the health of a chordate because it acts as a shock absorber for the spinal cord and brain and helps maintain chemical homeostasis. Moreover, “dorsal” describes the position of the hollow nerve cord as running along the backside of the animal’s body. All chordates contain the following features during development: CC BY 4.0",

Option B. Pharyngeal gill slits – This option is incorrect because all Chordata will, at some point in their development, have this structure. Eventually, pharyngeal gill slits either become gills, disappear, or develop into another structure. In humans, the pharyngeal slits eventually develop into the inner ear.

Muscular postnatal tail – This option is incorrect because this structure is found in Chordata at some point during embryonic development. Most chordates retain this structure even through adulthood. For example, fish, reptiles, birds, and most mammals possess a postnatal tail. This structure, however, is sometimes “lost” by the time the animal reaches adulthood and becomes a vestigial structure. In apes (including humans), the remnant of the muscular post-anal tail is the coccyx, more commonly known as the tailbone.",
