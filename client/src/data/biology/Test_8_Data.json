      "concept_text": "Angiosperms , also known as anthophyta, are flowering plants which include fruits, maple, oaks, grass, etc., and are the dominant land plant form. The flower is the reproductive structure of an angiosperm. The pistil, specifically, is the female reproductive structure, consisting of three parts: ovary, style, and stigma. The ovary encloses one or more ovules with an egg nucleus. The ovule inside the ovary consists of a megaspore mother cell that undergoes meiosis to form four haploid megaspores. Since meiosis takes place inside the female reproductive structure (pistil), specifically the ovary, Option B is correct. Angiosperms begin the process of fertilization when pollen lands on the sticky stigma. The pollen tube, a structure designed to deliver sperm cells to the female gametophyte, contains two sperm cells and a vegetative nucleus that can grow down the style toward the ovule. The ovule inside the ovary consists of a megaspore mother cell that undergoes meiosis to form four haploid megaspores. One of these megaspores survives to undergo mitosis three times to create eight nuclei. Six of the nuclei form an embryo sac which contains the egg. Once the pollen tube (two sperm cells) reach the embryo sac, one sperm cell fertilizes the egg and forms a diploid zygote. The other sperm cell fuses with polar nuclei to create a triploid nucleus and endosperm for nutrient supply. This unique process of fertilization is called double fertilization. Double fertilization is the fertilization of the egg and polar nuclei each by a separate sperm cell. Aside from the pistil, the major parts of a flower also include the stamen and petals. The stamen is the male reproductive structure, consisting of three parts: pollen-bearing anther, stalk, and filament. The petals function to attract pollinators and also protect the flower bud. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Pedicel – Filament – This option is incorrect because the filament is part of the male reproductive structure of the plant and eggs are the sex cells of the female reproductive structure of the plant. The filament functions to support the anther, the pollen-producing structure of the plant. The pedicel is a structure that attaches a single flower to its stem. Option C. Stamen – Anther – This option is incorrect because the stamen is the male reproductive structure of the plant and eggs are the sex cells of the female reproductive structure of the plant. The anther is a chamber where the pollen develops. Option D. Perianth – Sepal – This option is incorrect because the perianth and sepal are the part of the plant that hide and enclose the pistil. Hence, the perianth and sepal belong to the non-reproductive part of the plant. As the non-reproductive part of the plant, these structures do not serve a purpose in the production of egg cells. Option E. Stamen – Microsporangium – This option is incorrect because the stamen is the male reproductive structure of the plant and eggs are the sex cells of the female reproductive structure of the plant. The microsporangium is a structure in the plant’s male reproductive organ where the development of pollen takes place.",

      "concept_text": "Cell membranes consist of a continuous double layer of lipid molecules. Such biological membranes are mainly composed of phospholipids and proteins along with some cholesterol. Phospholipids , specifically, consist of a glycerol backbone, one phosphate group, and two fatty acid tails. The glycerol backbone and phosphate group are a part of the hydrophilic (water-loving; tendency to get absorbed or dissolved by water) head, whereas the two fatty acid tails are a part of the hydrophobic (water-fearing; tendency to not mix with water) tail. When a molecule has both polar and nonpolar parts, we call them amphipathic. The amphipathic nature of phospholipids has allowed them to form a lipid bilayer in which the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the extracellular/intracellular environment (which is aqueous) while the hydrophobic tails are hidden on the inside and therefore not exposed to water. While the hydrophilic part of the lipid bilayer comprises the glycerol backbone and phosphate group, the hydrophobic part of the lipid bilayer comprises the two fatty acid tails. Therefore, Option D is correct. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Polar head – This option is incorrect because polar molecules are hydrophilic, since polar molecules dissolve easily in water. Polar molecules dissolve easily in water because water is also a polar molecule and “like dissolves like”. Therefore, Option A is referring to the hydrophilic head of the lipid bilayer that consists of the glycerol backbone and phosphate group. Since the question is asking to identify the hydrophobic component of the lipid bilayer, this option is incorrect. Option B. Phosphate group – This option is incorrect because the phosphate group belongs to the hydrophilic head of the lipid bilayer, along with the glycerol backbone. Since the question is asking to identify the hydrophobic component of the lipid bilayer, this option is incorrect. Option C. R group – This option is incorrect because although the R group is located by the hydrophilic head, R groups can either be hydrophilic, hydrophobic, or neutral depending on its chemical structure. The R group of a phospholipid refers to a variable group of atoms/molecules that provides each phospholipid its unique chemical and physical properties. The R group of a phospholipid is attached to its phosphate group. Option E. Extracellular matrix – This option is incorrect because the extracellular matrix is not a component of the lipid bilayer and instead lies above it. The extracellular matrix, consisting of fibrous structural proteins, adhesion proteins, and polysaccharides secreted by cells, is found in animals between adjacent cells.

Membrane-bound organelles include the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, and peroxisomes. An example of a membrane-bound organelle found exclusively in eukaryotes is the nucleus. The nucleus serves to store genetic information. The nucleus contains chromatin, a general packaging structure of DNA around proteins. The nucleus, specifically the nucleolus inside the nucleus, also serves as the site of ribosome synthesis. Since prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus, they store their genetic material in an irregular shaped region called the nucleoid. Prokaryotic DNA exists in a single, circular, naked, double-stranded state without chromatin level organization. Therefore, Option A is correct. CC BY 4.0.",

      "concept_text": "The endosymbiotic theory is the leading evolutionary theory about the origin of early eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells. The endosymbiotic theory suggests that at some point in history, an aerobic or photosynthetic bacterium was engulfed by another cell to form mitochondria and chloroplasts respectively. The aerobic or photosynthetic bacterium was engulfed through phagocytosis (cell eating) then remained undigested as it provided new functionality to the engulfing cell. For example, the aerobic bacterium allowed cellular respiration within the engulfing cell that previously lacked such functionality. Similarly, the photosynthetic bacterium provided photosynthetic ability to the engulfing cell that previously lacked such functionality. CC BY 4.0 Evidence for the endosymbiotic theory includes similar key features between mitochondria and chloroplasts. 1) Mitochondria and chloroplasts both have their own naked and circular DNA, similar to prokaryotic DNA structure. 2) Mitochondria and chloroplasts both have a double membrane. 3) Mitochondria and chloroplasts both have 70S ribosomes consisting of the 50S and 30S subunits, similar to prokaryotic ribosomes. 4) Mitochondria and chloroplasts can both reproduce independently of the host cell through a fission-like process, similar to how prokaryotes replicate oneself. 5) Mitochondria and chloroplasts are both susceptible to antibiotics, indicating that the organelles may have bacterial origins. The presence of the naked and circular DNA within mitochondria and chloroplasts provides support to the endosymbiotic theory. Therefore, Option A is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Single membrane – This option is incorrect because mitochondria actually have double membranes, not a single membrane. The double membrane supports the endosymbiotic theory because it suggests that as the original free bacteria were internalized, it obtained a part of the host cell membrane in addition to its own membrane, leading to two separate phospholipid bilayers. Chloroplasts also have a double membrane which similarly adds support to the endosymbiotic theory. Option C. Production of ATP – This option is incorrect because while mitochondria do produce ATP through cellular respiration, the production of ATP is not a part of the evidence for the endosymbiotic theory. Option D. Same genome as host – This option is incorrect because mitochondria have its own naked and circular DNA, separate from the DNA of its host. The human nuclear genome is significantly larger, whereas the human mitochondrial genome is comparatively tiny and with different genes. The fact that mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own unique DNA and, therefore, have a different genome from its host provides support to the endosymbiotic theory. Option E. Division by mitosis – This option is incorrect because like bacteria, mitochondria actually divide by binary fission, not mitosis. Mitochondria and chloroplasts can both reproduce independently of the host cell through binary fission. Binary fission is a simple form of asexual reproduction in which an organism is directly separated into two organisms. On the other hand, mitosis is a more complex eukaryotic cell division mechanism of dividing and separating chromosomes that occurs in somatic cells. In prokaryotic cells, mitosis and meiosis do not occur.",

      "concept_text": "ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a common source of chemical energy. ATP stores potential energy in the form of chemical energy. New ATP is formed in the mitochondria via phosphorylation in which ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate come together using energy from the exergonic reactions such as the breakdown of glucose. ATP, however, is an unstable molecule because the three phosphates in ATP are negatively charged and repel each other. Hence, when one phosphate group is removed via hydrolysis, a more stable ADP molecule results. The change from a less stable molecule to a more stable molecule always releases energy; therefore, ATP hydrolysis releases energy. CC BY 4.0 Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) informs us whether a given chemical reaction can occur spontaneously. If ΔG is negative, then the reaction can occur spontaneously. On the other hand, if ΔG is positive, the reaction occurs non-spontaneously. Spontaneous chemical reactions are generally more favorable than non-spontaneous chemical reactions. In the context of biology, chemical reactions can be coupled together if they share intermediates. Hence, an unfavorable reaction with a positive ΔG value can be driven by a second, highly favorable reaction with a negative ΔG value. In other words, an unfavorable endergonic reaction can be driven by a favorable exergonic reaction. This is how ATP drives chemical work. When the chemical bonds within ATP are broken, energy is released and that energy can be harnessed for cellular work that may be endergonic. Therefore, Option A is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Brings the reactants closer together – This option is incorrect because ATP does NOT bring reactants closer together and instead serves as an energy source for important biological functions. Enzymes bind to reactant molecules and bring them closer together such that chemical bond-breaking and bond-forming processes can take place more readily. By doing so, enzymes are able to speed up chemical reactions. Option C. Generates glucose molecules – This option is incorrect because ATP does not produce glucose molecules. The main purpose of ATP is serving as an energy source for important biological functions by harnessing energy from exergonic reactions to power endergonic reactions. In fact, the reverse occurs in cellular respiration: glucose is broken down to create ATP. Option D. Lowers the activation energy – This option is incorrect because enzymes are globular proteins that act as catalysts. Catalysts lower the activation energy of a reaction in order to accelerate the rate of the overall reaction. Since ATP is not an enzyme and does NOT lower activation energy, and instead serves as an energy source for important biological functions, this option is incorrect. Option E. Converts chemical energy to sunlight – This option is incorrect because the conversion of chemical energy to sunlight is not only NOT a function of ATP, but it is simply an impossible process that does not exist. During photosynthesis, sunlight is converted to chemical energy through a series of chemical reactions.",

Apex predators eat tertiary consumers, which eat secondary consumers , which eat primary consumers , which eat primary producers . Primary producers are autotrophs that convert sunlight into chemical energy. Primary producers include plants, photosynthetic protists, and cyanobacteria. An energy pyramid illustrates the amount of energy that is transferred at each trophic level. On average, only 10% of energy is transferred up trophic levels due to thermodynamic losses. 90% of the energy is lost to metabolism and to decomposers when they die. Hence, energy is greatest at the primary producer level and lowest at the tertiary consumer level. In living organisms, energy is stored in organic material which contributes to biomass. Thus, the trophic level with the greatest energy has the greatest biomass. In other words, the primary producers that directly receive energy from the sun have the greatest amount of biomass. Also, the number of organisms in a trophic level is directly proportional to the amount of biomass. Since there are more primary producers than any other type of organism on the energy pyramid, primary producers have the greatest biomass.  Therefore, Option D is correct. CC BY 4.0",

We know that each parent must contribute one of these chromosomes. Let’s look at their genotypes: Now, let’s examine what the son will inherit from each parent. The son is male and we know that the Y chromosome can only come from the father. This means the X chromosome will be inherited from the mother. Because the son has a 50% chance of inheriting either X chromosome from the mother, there is a 50% chance he will be XY (normal) and a 50% chance he will be X h Y (hemophiliac). Remember that even if a condition is X-linked recessive, it will be expressed in males because there is no second copy of the chromosome to mask the condition. Therefore, option X is correct. Remember that in this question, you are already being told the couple is having a son. The probability you calculate should be limited to outcomes with XY chromosomes, since the question is not asking the probability of having a son and the probability of that son having hemophilia, but already assumes that the child is a son.

In order for there to be a 0% chance that the couple’s son will have hemophilia, the mother must have two copies of the normal (wild-type) gene.

On the other hand, if two genes are unlinked (physically far apart), they are more likely to be separated during crossing over of homologous chromosomes.

Epigenetics regulates when certain genes are expressed. In other words, it allows specific genes to turn “on” or “off”. Since epigenetics do not alter the nucleotide sequence, epigenetic changes explain why genetically identical organisms can still have noticeable physical differences. Epigenetic changes take place by altering the chromatin structure. Chromatin is a condensed structure of DNA that is wrapped around proteins like histones to reduce their size. It is important to understand that the more tightly DNA is wrapped around histones, the less accessible it is for transcription and the lower the gene expression. On the other hand, the more loosely DNA is wrapped around histones, the more accessible it is for transcription and the higher the gene expression. Epigenetic regulation methods take advantage of the concept of “tight = silenced, loose = expressed”. Epigenetic changes include these two major modifications: Since epigenetics refers to heritable changes in the expression of genes due to modifications that do NOT alter the nucleotide sequence, it is incorrect that epigenetics modifies nucleotide sequence. Therefore, Option A is correct. CC BY 4.0",

This means that the modifications made to the DNA (not the nucleotide sequences) can be passed on from parent to daughter cell, or from parents to offspring. Option C. Contributes to phenotypic variability – This option is incorrect because epigenetic modifications influence gene expression by either inducing the expression or inducing the suppression of specific genes and thus do contribute to phenotypic variability. In other words, epigenetic changes explain why genetically identical organisms can still have noticeable physical differences. Option D. Influences gene expression – This option is incorrect because epigenetic changes do influence gene expression by affecting the accessibility of DNA and the ability of histones to wind DNA around itself. Specific genes are turned “on” or “off” under the influence of epigenetic changes. Option E. May result from external or environmental factors – This option is incorrect because epigenetic changes can be triggered by changes in the environment such as temperature, diet, exposure to chemicals and UV, as well as biological changes such as aging. These environmental factors can cause genetically identical twins to have noticeable physical differences. For example, if one twin maintained a nutritious diet while the other twin did not, the genetically identical twins may display a difference in size due to diet affecting growth.",

In other words, if allele frequencies remain constant from generation to generation, then there is no evolution. These are the requirements to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium: Large populations are necessary for decreasing the effects of genetic drift. Genetic drift is the random increase and decrease of an allele by chance. It has a larger effect on smaller populations because the chances of an allele being lost or fixed in the population become much higher.

Mutations are random changes in DNA sequence that introduce new alleles to a population. The random introduction of new alleles to a population disturbs Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Option C. No natural selection – This option is incorrect because the absence of natural selection is a requirement of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Natural selection is the increase and decrease of allele frequencies due to adaptations to the environment. The environment should not impact allele frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; hence, the absence of natural selection is a requirement of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Option D. No gene flow – This option is incorrect because the absence of gene flow is a requirement of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Gene flow is the introduction and removal of alleles from a population when individuals leave (emigrate) or enter the population. However, migration does not happen under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we assume that the population is isolated and isolated populations cannot have gene flow. Option E. Random mating – This option is incorrect because random mating is a requirement of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Random mating is a mating system in which individuals of a population choose mates randomly. Hence, random mating decreases the chances of any allele from changing in frequency. If the population took on a non-random mating system, then individuals would choose mates based upon particular traits, increasing the frequency of the alleles encoding those traits.",

They have antigen receptors, but do not make antibodies. Hence, T lymphocytes work by searching for antigens displayed by antigen-presenting cells instead of directly attacking antigens on a pathogen. All nucleated cells display MHC I (major histocompatibility complex I) on its plasma membrane. If a cell is infected by a virus, viral protein fragments are displayed on MHC I, indicating to a T lymphocyte that the cell is infected. The T cell then differentiates into a CD8 (cytotoxic) T cell that recognizes and destroys non-self cells by releasing perforin, a protein that can puncture cells. Perforin can attack many cells at once because they do not phagocytize infected cells. MHC II (major histocompatibility complex II) is displayed primarily by antigen-presenting cells that can take up and display free-floating fragments of pathogenic protein products. A T cell binding to MHC II differentiates into a CD4 (helper) T cell. This helper T cell stimulates the activation of B lymphocytes and other T lymphocytes.

      "concept_text": "The lymphatic system is the open, secondary circulatory system that transports excess interstitial fluid (lymph) through lymphatic vessels, the movement of which is aided by adjacent muscle contractions, and returns it to the primary circulatory system via the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct. The lymphatic system has valves to prevent backflow when fluid gets sent to the blood circulatory system. The image below illustrates the essential components of the human lymphatic system along with its function of draining fluid away from tissues. Since the main function of the lymphatic system is returning escaped fluids back to the primary circulatory system, Option B is correct. The lymphatic system also plays a role in transporting absorbed fats from the small intestine to the blood. In addition to absorbed fats, proteins and large particles that can’t be taken up by the capillaries are removed to the lymph. The lymphatic system also contains lymph nodes that have phagocytic leukocytes that filter the lymph and serve as immune response centers. CC BY 4.0",

The absorbed fats are transported from the small intestine to the blood. Option C. Transport of nutrients towards target cells – This option is incorrect because the transport of nutrients towards target cells is carried out by the circulatory system and the capillaries interacting with the target cells, not the lymphatic system. The circulatory system is responsible for transporting nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and red blood cells throughout the body. Option D. Synthesis of erythrocytes – This option is incorrect because erythrocytes (red blood cells) are produced in the red bone marrow, not in the lymphatic system. Hematopoietic stem cells of the red bone marrow give rise to mature erythrocytes. Option E. Take up particles except larger proteins – This option is incorrect because the lymphatic system can recover proteins and large particles that cannot be directly taken back into the capillaries due to the limited gaps between capillary epithelial cells. These proteins and large particles are removed from the lymph, and eventually brought back into the circulatory system.",

      "concept_text": "Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter secreted at the neuromuscular junction, between neurons in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.  Acetylcholine primarily functions to excite skeletal muscles. Acetylcholine receptors are known as cholinergic receptors . Acetylcholine binds to these receptors on post-synaptic membranes for nerve transmission, instead of directly entering the skeletal muscle cell. Acetylcholine is then broken down into acetic acid and choline in order for it to be recycled back to the pre-synaptic cell. The detection of acetylcholine by acetylcholine receptors triggers the opening of gated ion channels. As gated ion channels open up, positively charged sodium ions rush into the muscle fiber, causing it to depolarize. The depolarization leads to an action potential that is fired along the entire membrane to initiate contraction. Degradation of the acetylcholine signal in the synaptic cleft may occur in various mechanisms Since acetylcholinesterase performs hydrolysis to break down acetylcholine and terminate a signal, acetylcholinesterase prevents acetylcholine from remaining for too long in the synapse. Therefore, Option C is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Choline acetyltransferase – This option is incorrect because as its name suggests, choline acetyltransferase transfers an acetyl group onto choline to produce acetylcholine and thus is not involved in clearing acetylcholine from the synaptic cleft. (Note: Choline acetyltransferase goes beyond the scope of the exam.) Option B. Passive diffusion into pre-synaptic cell – This option is incorrect because acetylcholine does not passively diffuse back into the pre-synaptic cell. Instead, after acetylcholine binds to the receptors on muscle cells, it is broken down by acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft. Once acetylcholine is broken down into acetic acid and choline, its components are actively taken up by the pre-synaptic cell for recycling. Option D. Degradation by post-synaptic cell surface receptors – This option is incorrect because the post-synaptic cell surface receptor plays no role in breaking down acetylcholine. A receptor is a structure that receives and transmits a signal between extracellular and intracellular environments. The post-synaptic cell surface receptor, specifically, allows acetylcholine to bind to it and consequently opens up to allow the flow of ions. Acetylcholine is degraded by an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft. Option E. Uptake by post-synaptic cell – This option is incorrect because acetylcholine never enters the post-synaptic cell; it only binds to the receptors located at the surface of the post-synaptic cell. The acetylcholine is then broken down by acetylcholinesterase in the synapse.",

      "concept_text": "An action potential propagates down a neuron’s axon due to a cascade of ions. A stimulus causes gated ion channels to open, allowing an influx of Na + ions into the axon, depolarizing the neuron. If the threshold level is reached, an action potential is caused, resulting in the opening of voltage-gated Na + channels down the entire length of the neuron. The propagation of an action potential is also called a conduction impulse. The speed of an action potential is influenced by the size and myelination of an axon . An axon with a larger diameter allows an impulse to propagate faster because it has less resistance against the flow of ions. Thus, a thicker axon allows for a faster propagation of an action potential. The other factor affecting the speed of an action potential is myelination . The propagation of an action potential involves the opening of ion channels that let in Na + . In myelinated axons, when Na + flows into the axon at a Node of Ranvier, these ions rapidly diffuse down the axon within the myelinated segments to the next Node of Ranvier. In this manner, the action potential “jumps” from node to node. The “jumping” from node to node is called saltatory conduction. In unmyelinated axons, the action potential propagates slower because it has to propagate along the entire length of the membrane. On the other hand, in myelinated axons, the action potential propagates faster because it only has to jump from node to node. Furthermore, heavily myelinated axons allow impulses to propagate faster, since Na + ions are unable to leak out at myelinated sections that don’t have ion channels. Ion channels are positioned only on non-myelinated sections of the axon. Therefore, saltatory conduction occurs much faster in axons with heavy myelination. To sum up, the axons with the fastest conduction impulse will have a combination of a thick diameter and myelination. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Thin and myelinated – This option is incorrect because thin neurons whose axons have smaller diameters have an increased resistance to ion flow which can slow down the velocity of the action potential. Option C. Thick and unmyelinated – This option is incorrect because the action potential has to propagate along the entire length of the membrane in unmyelinated axons, causing a slower conduction impulse. Furthermore, unmyelinated neurons lack the necessary myelin insulation that prevents charge leakage out of the neuron from the neuron membrane. This charge leakage causes the neuron’s signal to dissipate at a faster rate which means that the signal will not travel as far or as fast. Option D.

      "concept_text": "The stages of embryonic development are as follows. When the egg (female gamete) is fertilized by a sperm (male gamete), a diploid zygote forms. The zygote then undergoes cleavage. The cleavage stage involves the rapid cell division of the zygote without cell growth and produces cells called blastomeres. Blastomeres have less cytoplasm than the original zygote. Successive cleavage results in a solid ball of ~8 cells called the morula. Cell division continues and liquid fills the morula, pushing cells outward to form a circular cavity surrounded by a single layer of cells. This hollow, 128-cell structure is called the blastula. The fluid-filled cavity is called the blastocoel.  In humans, the blastula is called the blastocyst when it implants into the endometrium. The blastocyst consists of an outermost trophoblast that forms the extraembryonic membranes and the inner cell mass that develops into the embryo. Hence, the zygote is the earliest stage seen during embryonic development because the zygote is formed once sperm and ovum nuclei fuse. The zygote stage is followed by a series of cleavage to form the next stages of the developing embryo. Therefore, Option B is correct. CC BY 4.0",

Blastocyst – This option is incorrect because the blastocyst stage comes after the morula stage. In humans, the blastula is called the blastocyst when it implants into the endometrium. The blastocyst contains an outermost trophoblast as well as inner cell mass. Option D. Blastomere – This option is incorrect because blastomeres are not an embryonic stage. Blastomeres are cells formed by the rapid cell division of the zygote (earliest stage seen during embryonic development). Option E. Trophoblast – This option is incorrect because the trophoblast is a thin layer of cells forming the outer layer of a blastocyst. The trophoblast produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to maintain estrogen and progesterone production from the corpus luteum. The estrogen and progesterone production maintains the endometrium during pregnancy. Since the trophoblast doesn’t arise until after the morula stage, and is not an embryonic stage of development, this option cannot be correct.",

Dehydration synthesis refers to the chemical reaction in which there is a release of water when two smaller molecules are joined to form a larger molecule. Polymers are broken down by hydrolysis. Hydrolysis refers to the chemical reaction in which water is used to break down the chemical bonds within a particular substance. CC BY 4.0 As shown in the table below, proteins are composed of amino acid monomers. Since enzymes are proteins that act upon substrate molecules, cellular enzymes are formed by the polymerization of amino acid monomers. Therefore, Option B is correct. Canadian DAT Pro Tip: It is important to know the monomers that form the 4 main biological macromolecules (also known as polymers). CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Phospholipid bilayer from monosaccharides – This option is incorrect because phospholipids are formed from glycerol, two fatty acids, and a phosphate group. Monosaccharides are not the monomer for phospholipid bilayer, but are rather the monomer for polysaccharides (carbohydrates) such as glycogen, amylopectin, and cellulose. Furthermore, phospholipids are not polymers because while they are composed of monomers, they don’t consist of a series of repeating monomers. Option C. Glycogen from nucleic acids – This option is incorrect because glycogen is formed from monosaccharide monomers (in this case, glucose). Nucleic acids are not the monomer for glycogen, but are rather the polymer for nucleotides. Option D. Peptide from fatty acids – This option is incorrect because peptides are not formed from fatty acids. Peptides are formed from amino acid monomers. Fatty acids are not the monomer of peptides, but are rather the monomer that makes up lipid macromolecules such as phospholipids and triglycerides. Phospholipids consist of two fatty acids while triglycerides consist of three fatty acids. Option E. RNA from cholesterols – This option is incorrect because RNA is not formed from cholesterol. Nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are formed from nucleotide monomers. Cholesterol is not the monomer for RNA, but is rather a precursor for many types of hormones such as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, progestins, androgens, and estrogens. Cholesterols are steroids composed of three 6-membered rings and one 5-membered ring.",

      "concept_text": "The immune system consists of an innate and adaptive component. While the innate immune system provides generalized protection, the adaptive immune system develops a specific response to a specific antigen. Though it does not play a major role in protecting the body during a primary immune response, it does protect the body from future infections in a secondary immune response. The B lymphocytes are a part of the adaptive immune system and control antibody-mediated or humoral immunity, as shown in the image below. With the help of helper T cells, B cells differentiate into plasma and memory B cells. The plasma cells produce antibodies that are released into the blood to attack bacteria. These antibodies may tag a pathogen for digestion via opsonization, neutralize said antigen, or lead to the activation of the complement system. Instead of releasing antibodies, the memory B cells retain information for receptors of antigens. This is essential in providing a significantly faster antibody response to subsequent infections by the same detected antigen in a secondary immune response. Since the memory B cells of B lymphocytes are able to retain the memory of previously encountered antigens, Option E is correct. Under the clonal selection theory, a wide variety of antigens are present on pre-existing B cells even before the body has needed to respond to some pathogen. This wide variety of B cell receptors allows the body to potentially recognize a pathogenic antigen. When this occurs, this particular B cell will then undergo clonal expansion to multiply and produce memory B cells and plasma cells in preparation for a future infection by that same pathogen. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. A component of the innate immune system – This option is incorrect because B lymphocytes are a component of the adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system involves an immune response geared toward recognizing a specific antigen. It is called adaptive because it develops after the primary response when the body learns to recognize a particular antigen. Recognition of the antigen is retained in memory B cells. On the other hand, the innate immune system involves nonspecific immunity in which the body provides generalized cellular protection against pathogens as the first line of defense. Option B. A component of cell-mediated immunity – This option is incorrect because B lymphocytes control antibody-mediated immunity instead of cell-mediated immunity. Antibody-mediated immunity involves the response to antigens or pathogens that circulate in lymph or blood. During an antibody-mediated response, macrophage and helper T cells stimulate B cell production. The B cells then produce plasma cells and memory cells. On the other hand, cell-mediated immunity is controlled by T lymphocytes that respond to non-self cells. The cell-mediated response is a response to cells invaded internally by pathogens. Option C. Consists of cytotoxic B cells and Helper B cells – This option is incorrect because the classes of B lymphocytes are the antibody-producing plasma cells and memory B cells. The perforin-producing cytotoxic T cells and immunity-boosting helper T cells are classes of T lymphocytes. Option D. Surrounds pathogens to tag for phagocytosis – This option is incorrect because the antibodies produced by plasma B cells participate directly in opsonization. Opsonization is the process of tagging a pathogen with antibodies to signal them for phagocytosis. The plasma B cells themselves play an indirect role by producing these antibodies, but do not directly surround the pathogens themselves.",

Complex organic molecules were then synthesized from inorganic compounds. As polymers formed from the organic compounds and self-replicated, organic molecules became protobionts. Protobionts were the precursors of cells that were metabolically active but unable to reproduce. From these protobionts, primitive heterotrophic prokaryotes were formed. Once the primitive heterotrophic prokaryotes evolved and gained the ability to produce their own food, primitive autotrophic prokaryotes were formed. Cyanobacteria is an example of an autotrophic prokaryote. The photosynthetic ability of such autotrophs produced large amounts of oxygen, contributing to the formation of the ozone layer. The ozone layer caused the termination of primitive cells and abiotic evolution, leading to the formation of eukaryotes. The endosymbiotic theory explains that eukaryotic cells originated among prokaryotes. The earliest autotrophic cells to appear on Earth were the primitive autotrophic prokaryotes (the cyanobacteria). The atmosphere did not yet contain significant amounts of oxygen, and these autotrophic cells did not rely on oxygen to survive. They were capable of performing photosynthesis and produced oxygen as a result. Therefore, Option D is correct.",

Aerobic organisms can survive and grow in an oxygenated environment; therefore, aerobic prokaryotes could not have existed in an environment lacking oxygen. Option B. Anaerobic eukaryotes – This option is incorrect because eukaryotes were introduced after heterotrophic prokaryotes and autotrophic prokaryotes were formed. The endosymbiotic theory explains that eukaryotic cells originated among prokaryotes. Therefore, anaerobic eukaryotes cannot be the earliest autotrophic cells to appear on Earth. Option C. Heterotrophs – This option is incorrect because the question is asking for the earliest autotrophic cells to appear on Earth. Autotrophs are organisms that can produce their own food, whereas heterotrophs are organisms that cannot produce their own food and instead take nutrition from other sources. Autotrophs and heterotrophs are mutually exclusive categories: by definition, it is impossible for an autotroph to be a heterotroph, and vice versa. Option E. Neutrophils – This option is incorrect because neutrophils are not autothophic cells. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that destroy pathogens through phagocytosis - the engulfment of foreign particles, bacteria, and dead or dying cells. Instead of producing their own food, neutrophils obtain nutrients such as glucose from external sources.",

Alternative splicing is the production of different combinations of introns and exons to allow a particular gene to express different variations of a particular protein product, as shown in the image below.

      "concept_text": "The fast and slow blocks of polyspermy are necessary to prevent polyploidy. These blocks work to make the fertilized egg impenetrable against additional sperm. First, let us review the process of fertilization . After sperm is activated by capacitation, the flagella become hyperactive and the acrosome is more permeable. When the sperm penetrates the outer corona radiata (dense layer of cells surrounding the oocyte) to bind to the ZP3 protein of the zona pellucida, mutual recognition occurs. This binding to ZP3 allows the acrosomal reaction to occur. The digestive enzymes in the acrosome degrade the zona pellucida to allow the sperm’s membrane to merge with that of the egg, depositing the sperm’s nucleus in the egg. The integration of the sperm’s nucleus with the egg’s nucleus now results in a diploid cell known as a zygote. This process of exocytosis of cortical granule contents may be familiar to you. Recall that in a neuron, the influx of Na + in the action potential’s wave of depolarization eventually leads to the opening of Ca 2+ channels that increase intracellular Ca 2+ levels. This leads to the exocytosis of neurotransmitters. The difference between this process and the slow block is the source of the Ca 2+ but in both cases, the increase in cytoplasmic Ca 2+ leads to exocytosis. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Hyperpolarization – This option is incorrect because membrane depolarization occurs due to the influx of Na + in the fast block of polyspermy. Hyperpolarization does not contribute to the formation of the polyspermy block. Option B. Intracellular acetylcholine release – This option is incorrect because acetylcholine is not involved in the polyspermy blocks. Furthermore, acetylcholine is not released intracellularly; it is released extracellularly into the neuromuscular junction. Option C. Extracellular calcium influx – This option is incorrect because it is actually intracellular, not extracellular, Ca 2+ that is released from intracellular stores to increase cytoplasmic Ca 2+ levels which will eventually lead to the exocytosis of cortical granules. Option E. Synthesis of ZP3 – This option is incorrect because synthesizing ZP3 proteins would not block polyspermy, as ZP3 proteins are necessary for the sperm to bind to the egg. The ZP3 proteins bind to proteins expressed in the head of the sperm and trigger the acrosomal reaction. This process is known as fertilization and thus cannot occur without the ZP3 protein.",

That is, the particular combination of sex chromosomes in the previous offspring has no bearing on the combination of the next offspring. Since the mother only has two X chromosomes, the female gamete is guaranteed to have an X chromosome. The father has an X and Y chromosome, so the male gamete has a ½ chance of having an X chromosome and a ½ chance of having a Y chromosome.

The Hardy-Weinberg model is as follows: p + q = 1 p 2 + 2pq + q 2 = 1 Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. The first part of this model describes how the only alleles present are the dominant and recessive alleles so the sum of their individual allele frequencies must be 1. The second part of this model describes how the probability of being homozygous for the dominant allele, heterozygous, and homozygous for the recessive allele must add to 1. In other words, all members of the population are either homozygous dominant (p 2 ), heterozygous (2pq), or homozygous recessive (q 2 ) for this particular gene. First, we examine the allele frequencies of the dominant and recessive alleles and verify that they sum up to 1. This indicates to us that these are the only alleles present for the gene in question. Here, we have 0.40 for the dominant allele and 0.60 for the recessive allele which indeed sums up to 1. Next, we calculate the frequency of the heterozygous individual.

This arises from the concept of telomere shortening , which is the shortening of DNA with each round of replication. Telomeres are DNA sequences found at the ends of chromosomes that are added to prevent the loss of important genomic information when chromosome ends get shorter. This is due to the way that the lagging strand works. DNA polymerase needs 3’-OH to start replicating, and after all RNA primers are removed, there is always an un-replicated region at the end of the strand. This is genetic information that is lost and provides a reason why telomeres shorten with each round of replication. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Wobble Effect – This option is incorrect the Wobble Effect explains flexibility in the identity of the third nucleotide in a codon. The Wobble Effect describes how one amino acid can be coded for by several different codons. Hence, it minimizes the damage that can be caused by a misreading of a codon. For example, if the codon CUU, coding for the amino acid leucine, was misread as CUC, CUA, or CUG during transcription, the codon will still be translated as leucine. Option B. Genetic drift – This option is incorrect because genetic drift describes the change in allele frequency that occurs due to the random movement of members of a population. Genetic drift is particularly susceptible to occurring in small populations that already have a low number of members. Genetic drift is a way to describe gene changes in populations whereas the question asks about a phenomenon that occurs in an individual, particularly related to its cell division and replication. Option C. Genetic equilibrium – This option is incorrect because genetic equilibrium is a state where allele frequencies do not change with time and thus no evolution is occurring. Genetic equilibrium is also known as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Since genetic equilibrium is used to describe populations, this answer choice cannot be correct as the question asks about a phenomenon that occurs in an individual, particularly related to its cell division and replication. Option E. Theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics – This option is incorrect because this answer choice is describing Lamarck’s theory which states that body features acquired during one‘s lifetime can be passed down to their offspring. For example, a giraffe that developed a long neck to reach and eat from tall trees can pass that acquired characteristic to their offspring. However, it is important to note that this is a discredited theory of evolution and that this answer choice is further incorrect because evolution applies to populations and not specific individuals.",

      "concept_text": "Gene expression is the process of converting a gene into a protein product through the steps: transcription and translation. DNA is converted to RNA through transcription and RNA is converted to proteins through translation. During translation, amino acids are added to a growing chain to form a functional protein. Translation , specifically, involves using mRNA as a template to produce a polypeptide that may fold into a protein. The ribosome holds the mRNA. The particular sequence of three nucleic acids, or codon, is “read” by the ribosome and tRNA (transfer RNA) with the corresponding amino acid for that codon delivers the amino acid to the ribosome for polymerization. This process is known as translation because genetic information is translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids and proteins. The process of translation is illustrated below. Based on codon readings, tRNA delivers corresponding amino acids to ribosomes for amino acid polymerization. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",

Monosaccharides – This option is incorrect because the linking of monosaccharides is done by dehydration/condensation reactions that remove water molecules and thus form glycosidic bonds between monosaccharides. tRNA is not involved in the process of polymerizing monosaccharides. Option C. Ribonucleic acids – This option is incorrect because the linking of ribonucleic acids (RNA) is done by an enzyme called RNA polymerase during RNA synthesis as part of transcription. RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA molecules from a template of DNA. tRNA is not involved in the process of polymerizing ribonucleic acids. Option D.

DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA molecules from nucleotides. tRNA is not involved in the process of polymerizing deoxyribonucleic acids. Option E. Genes – This option is incorrect because genes are arranged on DNA chromosomes with each gene having its unique position called a locus. Genes are not “linked” together by a process and exist along a chromosome in a specific order. (Note that the concept of “linked genes” is different from the process of “linking” described in the question.

      "concept_text": "Lamarck proposed that traits are inherited by offspring based on the use or disuse of these traits. Traits that are used would be strengthened and readily passed on to offspring while traits that were in disuse would weaken and be less prominent in offspring if present at all. However, this theory was disproved because evolution applies to populations and not specific individuals. For example, the offspring of athletes are not necessarily any fitter than the offspring of non-athletes If Lamarck‘s theory were to be correct, then the offspring of athletes should be fitter than the offspring of non-athletes because athletes with good physique would be able to pass on strong physical traits to their offspring. Physical characteristics themselves cannot be passed onto offspring; only genes can be passed on. Therefore, Option A is best associated with the theory of use and disuse. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Darwin – This option is incorrect because Darwin proposed the theory of natural selection, also known as “survival of the fittest”, to explain evolution. This theory proposed that due to competition for limited resources, traits that enabled a species to produce more viable offspring were passed down. In other words, alleles that provide a reproductive advantage will be selected for and become more common from one generation to the next. Alleles that are disadvantageous will be selected against and become less common. Over time, populations become more adapted to their environment. Option C. Cuvier – This option is incorrect because Cuvier proposed the theory of catastrophism where major natural disasters shaped the structure and types of life on Earth. In other words, the alleles that managed to survive extinction would reproduce and be passed on to offspring. Therefore, the particular traits depend on what traits are randomly driven to extinction and what traits are spared by the catastrophe. While catastrophes can play a role in driving evolution, they fail to explain the gradual evolutionary changes shown in fossil records to the same extent as other theories, such as Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection. Option D. Mendel – This option is incorrect because Mendel experimented with pea plants to explore the nature of inheritance. From this research, he put forth the laws of inheritance that described how alleles were inherited. Mendel proposed that heritable factors (genes) come in pairs (alleles) that are independently inherited, one allele from each parent. Option E. Wallace – This option is incorrect because Wallace co-authored research with Darwin regarding evolution and natural selection. He independently proposed the theory of natural selection as well, then built the theory up with Darwin’s work which led to the more comprehensive theory of natural selection as we understand it today.",

Pheromones can be detected through various means including smelling and ingestion. Depending on the chemical, they may result in a variety of different effects. Releaser pheromones trigger a reversible, short-term response. For example, ants use formic acid, a releaser pheromone, to mark a trail to food. Primer pheromones trigger long-term physiological and behavioral changes in development. For example, a queen bee can release a chemical to prevent the development of reproductive capabilities.

ADH acts on these collecting ducts to increase the number of aquaporin channels which allow more water to leave the urine and become reabsorbed by the cells of the collecting duct. Hence, ADH makes the urine more concentrated by facilitating the transport of water out of urine and into the cells of the collecting duct. That water is eventually brought back to the bloodstream, raising the blood volume. ADH also acts on the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, though its effect is greatest on the collecting duct.

The Loop of Henle, making up a majority of the nephron, consists of the descending and ascending loops. The descending loop is permeable to water; hence, water leaves and the solute concentration in the tube increases. The descending loop of Henle allows organisms to reabsorb water; the longer the loop of Henle, the more water an organism can reclaim. The ascending loop then pumps out NaCl, causing the solute concentration in the tube to decrease. Option E. Acts on proximal convoluted tubule by decreasing permeability to water – This option is incorrect because ADH does not act to decrease water permeability, but rather increases water permeability. Furthermore, ADH does not act on the proximal convoluted tubule and, in fact, acts primarily on the collecting duct.",

      "concept_text": "The main functions of the large intestine are the absorption of water, electrolytes, and vitamins. The absorption of water in the colon of the large intestine concentrates the indigestible material, producing feces that are stored in the rectum. The large intestine also absorbs electrolytes through its ion channels. Furthermore, symbiotic bacteria in the large intestine produce vitamin K and B12 that can be absorbed in the intestines. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer. The roles of the different segments of the digestive system are summarized below. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Stomach – This option is incorrect because the stomach does not carry out the absorption of water or nutrients. The stomach is the site of mechanical and chemical digestion of food (particularly proteins). The muscles in the stomach are activated to break down food. The stomach also secretes gastric juice, containing digestive enzymes and HCl, to break down food that enters the stomach. Option B. Ileum – This option is incorrect because while the jejunum and the ileum that follows are the primary sites of nutrient absorption and some water absorption occurs as well, mineral absorption does not occur in these sites. Aside from the absorption of nutrients, the ileum also contains Peyer’s patches which are large aggregates of lymphoid tissue. Furthermore, the ileum is a part of the small intestine. Since there is no bacteria-produced vitamin K in the small intestine, this option is incorrect. Option D. Duodenum – This option is incorrect because the duodenum is the site of continuing digestion by pancreatic digestive enzymes and bile from the liver. The duodenum breaks down starch and proteins as well as other food types such as fats and nucleotides. Hence, very little if any absorption occurs in the duodenum. Furthermore, the duodenum is a part of the small intestine. Since there is no bacteria-produced vitamin K in the small intestine, this option is incorrect. Option E. Jejunum – This option is incorrect because while the jejunum and the ileum that follows are the primary sites of nutrient absorption and some water absorption occurs as well, mineral absorption does not occur in these sites. Furthermore, the jejunum is a part of the small intestine. Since there is no bacteria-produced vitamin K in the small intestine, this option is incorrect.",
