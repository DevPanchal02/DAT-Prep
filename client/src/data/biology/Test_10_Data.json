The three classes of biopolymers are polypeptides, nucleic acids, and sugars. Amino acids are combined to form a chain known as a polypeptide (e.g., protein). Individual nucleic acids are joined to form polynucleotides (e.g., DNA and RNA). Individual monosaccharides are joined to form polysaccharides (e.g., starch, glycogen, amylose, etc.). As mentioned above, amino acids are bonded together in long chains to create polypeptides, also called proteins. Enzymes are tertiary (globular) protein molecules, thus they are made up of amino acids. Therefore, Option C . Amino acid and digestive enzyme is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",

Deoxyribonucleic acid and ribosome – This option is incorrect because ribosomes consist of both proteins and RNA components which consist of amino acid and ribonucleotide monomers respectively. Deoxyribonucleic acid is not a monomer but is actually made up of monomers called deoxyribonucleotides which DO NOT play a direct role in the structure of ribosomes. Option B. Nucleic acid and phospholipid – This option is incorrect because phospholipids are made up of a glycerol molecule, two fatty acids, and a phosphate group. Nucleic acids are monomers that join together to form polynucleotides such as DNA and RNA. Option D. Cholesterol and polysaccharide – This option is incorrect because polysaccharides are made up of simple sugars called monosaccharides, held together by glycosidic bonds. For example, the polysaccharide, starch, is composed of glucose monomers. Cholesterol is a lipid and therefore, is not a monomer of polysaccharides. Recall that cholesterol is the precursor for steroid hormones. Option E. Amino acid and ribozyme – This option is incorrect because ribozymes are RNA molecules that act as enzymes. Because ribozymes are RNA molecules, they are made up of ribonucleotide monomers, not amino acids, making the answer choice incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "When blood reaches the capillary beds, it is the hydrostatic pressure at the arteriole end of the capillary that pushes out some of the plasma into the interstitial space (the space between cells). However, some of this fluid returns to circulation at the venous end of the capillary due to oncotic pressure, also known as colloid osmotic pressure. The remaining fluid within the interstitial space will be filtered and returned to venous circulation via lymphatic vessels. This fluid is called lymph once it has entered a lymphatic vessel. This balance of filtration due to hydrostatic pressure and reabsorption due to oncotic pressure is illustrated below. Oncotic pressure results from the fact that large proteins, primarily albumin, cannot move out of the capillaries. The greater concentration of proteins inside the blood compared to the lymph results in a gradient that draws some fluid back into the capillaries through osmosis. In summary, oncotic pressure and hydrostatic pressure move fluid in opposite directions. Oncotic pressure draws fluid into blood vessels while hydrostatic pressure pushes fluid out of blood vessels. If there were fewer plasma proteins, oncotic pressure is reduced so less fluid is returned to the blood and more fluid remains behind in the lymph. This would result in increased lymph volume. Therefore, Option A . Greater lymph volume , is the correct answer. CC BY 3.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Blood volume increase – This option is incorrect because less blood plasma proteins would lead to a decreased oncotic pressure as there are less proteins acting to pull water into the blood vessels. This means that less water will be moving into the blood vessels which would lead to a decreased blood volume. Option C. Elevated hydrostatic pressure – This option is incorrect because hydrostatic pressure is not affected by blood plasma proteins. Hydrostatic pressure is simply the pressure that blood exerts on the walls of blood vessels or capillaries after being pumped from the heart. The pressure that is affected by a change in the concentration of blood plasma proteins is the oncotic pressure. Less blood plasma proteins would cause a reduction in the oncotic pressure and an increase in blood plasma proteins would cause an increase in the oncotic pressure. Option D. Greater oncotic pressure – This option is incorrect because less blood plasma proteins would lead to a decreased oncotic pressure as there are less proteins acting to pull water into the blood vessels. Option E. More white blood cells – This option is incorrect because a change in the concentration of blood plasma proteins does not affect the amount of white blood cells in the bloodstream.",

      "concept_text": "There are various digestive enzymes for the various major biomolecules. The major names to recognize are discussed below. Based on this information, the answer is Option E. Chymotrypsin . ◦ Proteases/Peptidases catalyze the breakdown of proteins into small chains or single-unit amino acids. ◦ Pepsin is a protease secreted as pepsinogen by the stomach’s chief cells. Pepsinogen is the inactive precursor of pepsin that becomes activated when it is exposed to the stomach’s acidic environment. This activation by cleavage makes pepsinogen a zymogen. Pepsinogen is released due to stimulation by the hormone gastrin which is released by the G cells of the stomach when it is filled with food. ◦ Trypsin is a protease secreted in its inactive form (trypsinogen) by the pancreas. Trypsinogen is activated via cleavage by another protease, enteropeptidase, to form active trypsin. ◦ Chymotrypsin is another protease that is released by the pancreas as chymotrypsinogen. Chymotrypsinogen is the inactive precursor (zymogen) of chymotrypsin that becomes activated in the presence of trypsin. ◦ Amylases , salivary and pancreatic, break starches and glycogens down into simpler carbohydrates. ◦ Lipases break down fats into individual fatty acids and glycerol which can be absorbed through the intestinal epithelia. Gastric lipase is released due to stimulation by the hormone gastrin which is released by the G cells of the stomach when it is filled with food. ◦ Nucleases break down nucleic acids into individual nucleotides.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Gastrin – This option is incorrect because gastrin is not an enzyme but rather a peptide hormone. Gastrin is secreted by G cells when food enters the stomach. The release of gastrin causes parietal cells to secrete HCl. Gastrin also causes chief cells to secrete pepsinogen and gastric lipase. Option B. Amylase – This option is incorrect because this enzyme is a carbohydrase that is responsible for breaking down polysaccharides into smaller saccharide chains. Proteases are responsible for breaking down proteins. Option C. Nuclease – This option is incorrect because this enzyme is responsible for breaking down nucleic acids. Proteases are responsible for breaking down proteins. Option D. Helicase – This option is incorrect because this enzyme functions in DNA replication to unwind the DNA strands so each individual strand can be replicated.",

      "concept_text": "When viewing phylogenetic trees , a common form like the one shown in the example places the oldest ancestral organism at the bottom and the more recent descendants at the top. The nodes represent a common ancestor of the related descendants. Consider, for example, nodes A and B below. Node A represents the common ancestor of humans, bonobos, and chimpanzees. Node B represents the common ancestor of both the bonobos and chimpanzees. The orange line prior to node B represents the ancestral lineage of common ancestor B. What these nodes are indicating is a speciation event (the formation of a new and distinct species) in which an ancestral lineage gives rise to new, more recent lineages. In the example here, the orange line in the image below represents the ancestral lineage of common ancestor B. However, a speciation event occurs, and this ancestor gives rise to two new species that can no longer mate (this inability to mate is what truly makes two species separate). This gives rise to the new bonobo and chimpanzee lineages. Point C represents a branch. Branches represent a series of ancestors that lead to a node or a branch tip. In this case, the branch represented by point C represents the ancestors of chimpanzees (but not bonobos). Because there was a speciation event of a common ancestor between bonobos and chimpanzees, a node was created in the phylogenetic tree (node B) causing a subbranch to be created for bonobos rather than their own distinct branch. This subbranch is meant to indicate that bonobos and chimpanzees share a common ancestor and are evolutionarily related to each other. Therefore, Option E . Chimpanzees and bonobos have a shared common ancestor is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Chimpanzees and bonobos have a common ancestor that is a female-dominant species – This option is incorrect because there is nothing to indicate that the ancestor of chimpanzees and bonobos is a female-dominant species according to the information in the phylogenetic tree. Common ancestors do not necessarily share the traits of their descendants. Furthermore, the gender ratio of an organism is not represented by phylogenetic trees, which show evolutionary relationships over time. Option B. Bonobos do not share a common ancestor with humans – This option is incorrect because Bonobos and chimpanzees do share a common ancestor with humans. Following the lineages back, node A represents the common ancestor to all three descendants. Option C. Bonobos are more closely related to humans than chimpanzees – This option is incorrect because the most recent common ancestor to both the bonobos and humans is the ancestor at node A. This ancestor is also the ancestor of chimpanzees. Since this speciation event that gave rise to the human, bonobo, and chimpanzee lineages is the earliest speciation event, we know that humans branched off from this common ancestor first. The next speciation event that gives rise to the new bonobo and chimpanzee lineages (at note B) is more recent. This means that bonobos cannot be more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees. Additionally, phylogenetic trees are meant to be read from bottom to top. Relationships on the horizontal axis mean nothing in phylogenetic trees. In fact, the bonobos and chimpanzees could swap positions on the tree and still be equally valid. Option D. Chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than bonobos – This option is incorrect. See the detailed explanation for Option C. Bonobo and chimpanzee lineages are the result of the most recent speciation event (at node B), so they are more closely related to each other than to humans.",

One of the major processes includes nitrogen fixation in which atmospheric nitrogen (N 2 ) is converted into ammonia (NH 3 ) and ammonium (NH 4 + ) by nitrogen-fixing bacteria in legume root nodules. Therefore, Option C . Root nodules , is the correct answer. Animals that ingest these plants now obtain some nitrogenous compounds from the plants. The decomposition of these animals and their waste products then releases ammonium into the soil. Ammonium is also produced via ammonification by free nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil. Through nitrification, ammonium is converted to nitrites (NO 2 - ) which are then converted to nitrates (NO 3 - ) by other bacteria. These nitrates can then be incorporated by plants via the assimilation (absorption of food or nutrients) of nitrogen. Animals can also ingest nitrogen in this manner. Denitrifying bacteria convert nitrates (NO 3 - ) back into atmospheric nitrogen (N 2 ). CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Rhizoids – This option is incorrect because rhizoids are hair-like structures of bryophytes that help anchor them into the soil and absorb nutrients. However, they are not considered true roots as bryophytes lack true vascular tissue. Recall that examples of bryophytes include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. While plants are involved in nitrogen assimilation (the absorption of nutrients), they do not directly perform nitrogen fixation themselves. Option B. Dinoflagellates – This option is incorrect because dinoflagellates are a type of plant-like protist. Plant-like protists belong to the kingdom Eukarya. Eukaryotes are not able to fix nitrogen. This process is only capable of being done by prokaryotes. It is worth mentioning that eukaryotes can form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing organisms, which offers an efficient method for eukaryotic organisms to obtain fixed nitrogen. Option D. Detritivores– This option is incorrect because detrivores are a subclass of decomposers. Examples of detrivores include worms, slugs, and millipedes. These organisms help break down organic wastes (detritus). Detritivores do not participate in nitrogen fixation, rather, they release N 2 by converting organic compounds back to NH 4 + (ammonification). Option E. Tracheophytes – This option is incorrect. Tracheophytes are plants that possess vascular tissue (xylem and phloem). Plants are not capable of nitrogen fixation and instead, rely on other organisms to convert atmospheric nitrogen into nitrites and nitrates that plants can then assimilate for use.",

      "concept_text": "In order to answer this question, it is important to first understand that there are two different routes for bone formation. The first is known as intramembranous ossification where undifferentiated connective tissue is replaced by bone. This type of ossification is primarily seen in flat bones. The second type of ossification is known as endochondral ossification which is the growth of bone via the growth and solidification of cartilage at the growth plate. Endochondral ossification is more common than intramembranous ossification and is primarily seen in long bones. The epiphyseal plate or line marks the separation of the epiphysis and the metaphysis. During endochondral ossification, the lengthening of long bone s occurs from the epiphyseal growth plate. Chondrocytes (cartilage cells) add cartilage on the epiphysis side of the epiphyseal growth plate while the side closer to the diaphysis is ossified. As a result, as the long bone grows, cartilage is constantly added to one end of the epiphyseal growth plate while the other side is hardening. In adults, this epiphyseal growth plate fuses and no cartilage remains. Now, it is regarded simply as the epiphyseal plate . Therefore, Option B . Growth of cartilage in the epiphyseal plate is the correct answer. You do not need to know more details of long bone growth but a graphic showing the process is shown below for your reference. Note also that the epiphyseal growth plate is quite liable to fracture in children. Due to the relatively poor vasculature of the cartilage area, cartilage heals very slowly, and fractures of this type are slow to resolve. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Osteoblast activity in the bone marrow – This option is incorrect because the bone marrow is not the tissue that is responsible for bone growth. Red bone marrow, found in the epiphyses of long bones, is where blood stem cells are stored to create all the blood cells that exist in our bodies. Yellow bone marrow, found in the medullary cavity of long bones, stores fats. Option C. Osteoclast activity in the diaphysis – This option is incorrect because osteoclasts are responsible for breaking down and degrading bone. Therefore, it cannot be responsible for the growth of long bones. Also, growth in the shaft/central part of the bone (known as the diaphysis) does not result in the growth of the overall long bone but rather, increases the thickness of the bone. Option D. Osteoblast activity in the medullary cavity – This option is incorrect because the medullary cavity is not a tissue where bone growth occurs. The medullary cavity is a hollow cavity within the diaphysis where the bone marrow is contained. This yellow bone marrow is responsible for storing fat. It is not involved in the growth of long bones. Option E. Growth of cartilage in the cortical bone – This option is incorrect because bone growth in the cortical bone does not result in the overall growth of the long bones. Recall that cortical bone is the outer layer of bone comprised of osteons while cancellous bone is the inner layer of bone that contains a web of trabeculae. Cortical bone technically does not contain cartilage. It is actually the growth of cartilage in the epiphyseal plate that results in the growth of long bones.",

      "concept_text": "Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter involved in neuron-neuron communications, the neuromuscular junction, and the parasympathetic nervous system. For it to act on the post-synaptic cell, it must bind to receptors that recognize its specific shape. If some foreign molecule were to bind to acetylcholine, it would change or block acetylcholine’s shape from interacting with the receptor. This would prevent the propagation of the acetylcholine signal to the target cell. In this case, since the snake venom is binding with and blocking the function of acetylcholine, the result would be muscle paralysis. The acetylcholine is no longer able to target the post-synaptic receptors, which prevents ligand-gated and voltage-gated sodium channels to open on the skeletal muscle fiber. If these channels are not able to open, no additional sodium will enter the cell to cause it to depolarize and there will be no stimulation for a skeletal muscle contraction. Therefore, Option E . Post-synaptic cell will not depolarize , is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Acetylcholinesterase will be destroyed – This option is incorrect because acetylcholinesterase is the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, primarily at the neuromuscular junction. Therefore, since the venom interacts with acetylcholine and not acetylcholinesterase, destroying acetylcholinesterase cannot be a possible mechanism of action for the venom. Option B. Voltage-gated calcium channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum will open – This option is incorrect voltage-gated calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic reticulum after an action potential has been successfully transferred from a neuron to the muscle fiber. Since the effects of acetylcholine have been blocked by the snake venom, the post-synaptic cell will not depolarize, and an action potential will not be transferred to the muscle fiber. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option C. Post-synaptic cell will hyperpolarize – This option is incorrect because acetylcholine will not be free to interact with the post-synaptic receptor on the post-synaptic cell. This means that there will not be an additional flow of ions into the cell so the cell will not hyperpolarize. It’s also important to mention that the cell will not depolarize (as it should with the interaction with acetylcholine). Option D. Ligand-gated sodium channels on the post-synaptic muscle fiber will open – This option is incorrect. When the venom binds to acetylcholine, it will prevent acetylcholine from binding to acetylcholine receptors on the sarcolemma of the postsynaptic muscle fiber. This means that ligand-gated sodium channels will not open and the post-synaptic muscle fiber will not depolarize.",

This area allows for gas exchange and also contains vascular bundles (xylem and phloem) for the transport of water and sugar. In the lower epidermis are openings called stoma. The opening and closing of the stoma is controlled by guard cells . These allow the uptake of CO 2 for photosynthesis and limit water loss by evaporation.

      "concept_text": "Allopatric speciation is the formation of new species, speciation , due to reproductive isolation resulting from a geographic barrier. This geographic barrier separates a population and interrupts gene flow. As a result, the gene pool diverges enough that reproduction between the separated population is no longer possible because the gametes are no longer compatible. Due to the lack of breeding between the separated populations and the evolution of each population to their respective environment, new species will be formed. Therefore, Option A . Allopatric speciation is the correct answer. In contrast, sympatric speciation is one that occurs without geographic barriers. Instead, reproductive isolation occurs by other mechanisms (balanced polymorphism, polyploidy, and hybridization). The image below illustrates this concept. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Adaptive radiation – This option is incorrect because adaptive radiation is the evolution of many species from one single ancestor. This occurs when members of the ancestral species are introduced to a new ecological niche and evolve to those new ecological conditions. Different environmental pressures cause the development of new traits that eventually leads to new species. Option C. Balanced polymorphism – This option is incorrect because this is a form of sympatric speciation that involves natural selection to create various polymorphisms. This can occur within an area due to different conditions within that area that a population can occupy. For example, a species of insect may develop different colors in an area because one group of those insects might camouflage with rocks while others may camouflage with logs. Since these insects are occupying different parts of a particular area, they will only interact with other similar insects in those same parts. The insects that camouflage with the rocks will now be isolated from the insects that camouflage with the logs. Therefore, reproductive isolation may occur and lead to speciation. Option D. Sympatric speciation – This option is incorrect because this occurs without geographic barriers. Instead, reproductive isolation occurs by other mechanisms (balanced polymorphism, polyploidy, and hybridization). Option E. Polyploidy – This option is incorrect because this is another form of reproductive isolation between the aneuploid gametes that are incompatible with normal diploid gametes. However, they can combine with other compatible aneuploid gametes and develop into a new species. The example that is commonly seen is amongst plants. A nondisjunction can occur in a 2n plant species that results in diploid gametes as opposed to normal haploid gametes. These diploid gametes are not compatible with haploid gametes but are still able to either self-pollinate or reproduce with other 2n gametes. This will result in a 4n zygote that is reproductively isolated from the original diploid species. If this 4n plant reproduces with another 4n plant, it can result in the formation of a new species.",

This is important for situations such as forensics or anthropology where there may be a very limited amount of DNA available for study. Therefore, Option E . PCR is the correct answer. Let us briefly review how a machine would perform the PCR technique as shown below. First, DNA primers are added to the DNA sample because DNA polymerase cannot synthesize new strands of DNA from scratch. In addition, taq polymerase (a heat-resistant DNA polymerase) is also added to the sample for synthesizing new strands. A thermal cycler machine cycles through three distinct stages to allow for the replication of the DNA sample. In the first stage ( denaturation ), the machine heats the sample up to around 95°C. The heat splits the DNA double helix into two new individual strands. Then, the temperature is decreased to around 60°C. This stage is called annealing and allows the DNA primers to hybridize to their complementary targets on each single strand of the DNA sequence. Finally, the sample is heated up again to around 70°C in order for the taq polymerase to synthesize the new DNA strands. This final stage is known as elongation or DNA synthesis . This completes one cycle of PCR. Each cycle doubles the amount of DNA in the sample. CC BY 3.0",

Habituation describes a form of learned behavior that allows an animal to disregard meaningless stimuli. This helps the animal avoid wasting energy on useless responses. An example is seen when sea anemones disregard a “feeding” stimulation with a stick. Therefore, Option D . Habituation is the correct answer.

While meiosis is similar to mitosis, there are subtle differences that are important to distinguish. Let’s briefly summarize the steps of the cell cycle. Interphase is the phase of the cell cycle that cells spend 90% of their time. Interphase can be broken up into 4 distinct stages: G 1 G 0, S, and G 2 . The stages of interphase are not crucial to answer this question so they will not be discussed in detail here. It is important, however, that you take the time to review and understand all phases of the cell cycle for the Canadian DAT, including the different stages of interphase. One important detail to note is that chromosome duplication occurs during the synthesis phase (S phase) of interphase. Keep this in mind moving forward. As previously mentioned, chromosomes are duplicated into sister chromatids during the S phase of interphase. These sister chromatids are identical and are attached at the centromere. Because of this duplication event, the cell in question now contains twice the number of chromatids (32) but still maintains the same number of chromosomes (16). Because the organism in question is diploid (2N), we know that each of its chromosomes contains a homologous pair, making the total number of chromosomes in the cell 16 (8 total pairs), hence 2N=16. During prophase I , these homologous chromosomes (that now contain 2 sister chromatids) pair up forming a tetrad (a pair of homologous chromosomes that are in physical contact for crossing over). During metaphase I , these tetrads line up at the metaphase plate before being pulled apart to opposite poles of the cell during anaphase I. It is important to note that anaphase I only separates the paired homologous chromosomes, NOT the sister chromatids. This means that the chromosome and chromatid count after anaphase I remains the same. After anaphase, telophase I and cytokinesis I separate the diploid parent cell into 2 haploid daughter cells. This is why meiosis I is referred to as a reductional division. It is after cytokinesis that the chromosome and chromatid count is halved in each of the daughter cells. Each daughter cell will have 8 chromosomes and 16 chromatids compared to the 16 chromosomes and 32 chromatids in the original parent cell. Therefore, Option C . 8 and 16 is the correct answer. Meiosis II in each daughter cell is very similar to mitosis. Prophase II is much like prophase I, however, there will be no pairing up of homologous chromosomes during prophase II because each daughter cell is now haploid. During metaphase II, the chromosomes (each with two sister chromatids attached at the centromere) line up at the metaphase plate. During anaphase II , the sister chromatids are pulled at the centromere to opposite poles of the cell. It is at this point that the chromatids are considered chromosomes. Keep in mind that the chromatid count remains the same at 16 but each one of these chromatids now represents a chromosome. This increases the chromosome count to 16 in each of the two daughter cells. After cytokinesis II, the chromosome and chromatid count are halved once again. This leads to 4 individual daughter cells that each have 8 chromosomes and 8 chromatids. The chart below tracks the chromosome and chromatid count of a 2N = 46 cell throughout each of the different phases of meiosis. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. 8 and 8 – This option is incorrect because meiosis I results in 2 haploid daughter cells that each possesses half the number of chromosomes and chromatids compared to the parent cell. However, these chromosomes will still have an intact centromere to keep the sister chromatids together as the splitting of the sister chromatids does not occur until meiosis II. Sister chromatids are not considered chromosomes until they are pulled apart at the centromere in meiosis II.

Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have ribosomes that function in protein translation, although the location of synthesis and structure is slightly different. Ribosomes are made up of two ribosomal subunits. These subunits are composed of ribosomal protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The proteins of ribosomes are manufactured by cytosolic ribosomes before being shuttled into the nucleolus. Once in the nucleolus, the rRNA and ribosomal protein assemble into a ribosomal subunit. These subunits are then shuttled back to the cytoplasm where they combine to form a fully functional ribosome. The nucleolus consists of regions of condensed DNA, RNA, and proteins that serve to manufacture ribosomal subunits, as shown in the image below. Therefore, Option C . Nucleolus is the correct answer.

      "concept_text": "The autonomic nervous system can be divided into two groups, the parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is associated with “fight or flight”. The sympathetic nervous system is activated during times of stress or potentially harmful situations. The sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate, can both dilate and constrict blood vessels (to redirect blood flow), dilate bronchi and bronchioles, increase glycogenolysis (the conversion of glycogen to glucose for energy), and inhibit digestion, urination, and salivary secretion. The parasympathetic nervous system works to activate the “rest and digest” state. This means increasing activity in organs responsible for digestion and excretion. Therefore, it causes contraction of the bladder,  relaxes muscles, lowers heart rate, and increases gastrointestinal activity. Below are some other functions of the autonomic nervous system that you should be familiar with for the Canadian DAT. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Vasoconstriction of peripheral vessels – This option is incorrect because vasoconstriction of peripheral vessels happens due to sympathetic activation. This happens to redirect blood flow to the heart (due to elevated heart rate), muscles, lungs, etc., as they are more involved and most important in the “fight or flight” response. Option B. Dilation of pupils – This option is incorrect because the dilation of pupils happens due to sympathetic activation, specifically to allow an increased amount of light to enter the eye during emergency situations. This leads to an increase in the amount of visual information that the organism receives to better handle the stressful situation at hand. Option D. Increased conversion of glycogen to glucose – This option is incorrect because the increased conversion of glycogen to glucose is associated with sympathetic activation. Glucose is the body’s primary form of energy. Glycogen is the storage form of glucose and can be found in the muscles and liver. Glycogen can be broken down into glucose through a process called ‘glycogenolysis’. This process occurs when there is a higher demand for glucose in the body. During the “fight or flight” response, muscles are more active and require more glucose delivery Option E. Contraction of the urinary sphincter – This option is incorrect because contraction of the urinary sphincter is associated with sympathetic activation. The urinary sphincter controls the flow of urine from the bladder to the urethra. Contraction of the urinary sphincter would prevent urination from happening as this is not a crucial process during a fight or flight response. Parasympathetic activation causes relaxation of the sphincter.",

      "concept_text": "Fertilization can be external or internal. External fertilization is fertilization that occurs outside of both parents’ bodies. The female lays the eggs then the male releases sperm near the eggs, after which the sperm must make their way to the eggs. For this reason, external fertilization is the dominant form of fertilization in aquatic animals where there is a fluid media for sperm to readily travel through. Since there can be many females and males involved and there is no precise mating between two individuals, there is a greater mixture of genes. In aquatic species that utilize external fertilization, fertilization is coordinated by conditions such as water temperature. Additionally, less complex reproductive structures are needed as the gametes are simply produced and released into the environment. Structures are not needed to precisely deposit gametes into the female or retain the fertilized egg for internal development. However, because the eggs develop outside the body, they are threatened by predation. Thus, the female may lay as many as a million eggs to compensate for the poor zygote survival rate. Internal fertilization occurs inside reproductive organs when the sperm arrives at or is deposited into the female reproductive system. Thus, the external environment does not play any direct role in the success of fertilization. This form of fertilization is found mostly in land animals. Since the egg is fertilized within the mother, the risks of predation of the zygotes are limited and the survival rate is increased compared to external fertilization. Because there is a higher chance of zygote survival, fewer gametes are necessary for a successful reproductive cycle. Therefore, Option C . Fewer gametes are necessary is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Mating does not need to occur on land – This option is incorrect because this is actually an advantage for external fertilization. External fertilization is often very efficient in aquatic environments because the sperm cells can be distributed and spread through water acting as a medium. The water is able to efficiently carry the sperm cells to the egg cells. Option B. Mating calls are not necessary – This option is incorrect because many times mating calls are necessary since internal fertilization requires two members of a species to get close. Mating calls are a method to attract mates which ultimately leads to reproduction. Option D. Less complex reproductive structures are needed – This option is incorrect . More complex reproductive structures are needed during internal fertilization in order to match the complimentary reproductive organs of the same species. This ensures fertilization only occurs within a species. Option E. Greater mixture of genes – This option is incorrect because internal and external fertilization only refers to the process of getting the sperm cells to the egg cell and the development environment of the resulting zygote. The two processes still have the same genetic variability associated with them.",

The structure of proteins can be broken down into four different levels: the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. The primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain where amino acids are joined together via peptide bonds. The secondary structure takes the form of either an alpha helix or a beta pleated sheet. These structures form due to hydrogen bonding between the amino (NH 2 ) and carboxyl (COOH) groups of amino acids in the proximity. The tertiary structure results from interactions between the various R groups of the amino acids within the polypeptide chain. The interactions between these R groups can be hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect, disulfide bonding (covalent bonding between cysteines), and Van Der Waals forces. And lastly, the quaternary structure consists of interactions between 2 or more polypeptide chains to create a protein complex. For example, hemoglobin contains four polypeptide chains in its total protein structure. All functioning proteins consist of a primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. Only some proteins contain a quaternary structure. This is an important concept to know for the Canadian DAT. The following diagram summarizes the 4 different types of protein structures: CC BY 4.0",

People with type A blood express the A antigen, type B expresses the B antigen, type AB expresses both A and B antigens, and type O does not express A or B antigens. As most evident by type AB blood expressing both A and B antigens, the I A and I B alleles are codominant , meaning that they can be expressed together, and one allele does not mask the other. However, both I A and I B alleles are completely dominant to the recessive i allele which does not produce antigens. This means that if an individual possesses the I A allele and the i allele, the i allele will be masked, and the individual will express the type A blood type. Let us consider the possible genotypes associated with each blood type phenotype with this in mind. CC By 4.0 Since blood type tests only test whether there are antigens that respond to particular antibodies by agglutination, these basic tests do not tell us whether a person with type A or type B blood is homozygous or heterozygous. We do not know whether the mother in question is homozygous or heterozygous for the I B allele so let us consider both possibilities. This question is simple to answer by using Punnett squares, which are shown below. We can see that the offspring cannot possibly have type O blood. Therefore, Option D . Type O is the correct answer. However, there is a simpler way to solve this. First, we must recognize that type O blood results when a person is homozygous for the recessive i allele.

      "concept_text": "The respiratory system is the organ system responsible for the exchange of gases between an organism and the external environment. Recall that oxygen is the final electron acceptor during oxidative phosphorylation , the process that directly relies on oxygen for the production of ATP. This makes the intake of oxygen, as well as the release of carbon dioxide, vitally important for life. It is important to note that the respiratory system works in conjunction with the circulatory system. The respiratory system is responsible for the intake of gases which then get passed along to the circulatory system which takes the essential gases to target bodily tissues. The circulatory system then returns non-essential gases from said bodily tissues to the respiratory system in order to be expelled from the body. There are two main circulatory systems that aid in the delivery of oxygen and expulsion of carbon dioxide from an organism: open circulatory systems and closed circulatory systems. Open circulatory systems do not rely on blood vessels to deliver gases to and from tissues within an organism. Open circulatory systems utilize hemolymph instead of blood as a medium for gas delivery. Closed circulatory systems, however, do rely on blood vessels that encapsulate blood and directly deliver gases to and from bodily tissues. Closed circulatory systems are much more efficient and are seen in organisms with greater oxygen demand, ultimately indicating a more efficient respiratory system. This is because when being transported in vessels, there exists a pressure that allows blood to reach greater distances in a much shorter amount of time. Because an open circulatory system is less efficient than a closed circulatory system, Option C. Open circulatory system is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Increased alveoli – This option is incorrect. Alveoli are small air sacs that exist as extensions to the bronchioles in the lungs. Alveoli are the surface area where the exchange of gases occurs between the (closed) circulatory system and the lungs. The more alveoli an organism has, the more surface area is available for gas exchange, ultimately leading to a more effective respiratory system. Because alveoli are only seen in organisms with a more efficient closed circulatory system, this option is incorrect. Option B. Moist skin – This option is incorrect. Earthworms are an example of an organism that coats themselves in mucous to increase moisture for simple diffusion. During this process, the moisture on the skin allows gases like carbon dioxide and oxygen to dissolve before diffusing into or out of an organism. Because of this, moist skin is favorable over dry skin for respiration. The closed circulatory system of the earthworm takes gases from the skin to the tissues and vice versa. Because earthworms have a more efficient closed circulatory system, this option is incorrect. Option D. Feathery gills – This option is incorrect. Feathery gills are respiratory structures commonly found in aquatic organisms. Gills are highly efficient structures that allow aquatic organisms to intake oxygen that’s dissolved in water. Similar to alveoli, gills are the surface area where gas exchange occurs. The greater the length/width of an organism’s gills, the more efficient its respiratory system will be; therefore, this option is incorrect. Option E. Blood vessels – This option is incorrect. Blood vessels are transport structures that encapsulate and deliver blood from tissues to the external environment and vice versa. Blood vessels ensure that gases are unable to diffuse out of the blood vessel until they’ve reached their destination. Blood vessels are exclusive to organisms that possess the more efficient closed circulatory system; therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "Natural selection is a non-random process in which certain adaptations and the associated alleles change in frequency due to environmental pressures, including competition. Natural selection is associated with ‘survival of the fittest’. Pressures result from competition for limited resources, heritable traits that affect reproduction, and the presence of genetic variations in a population that make some individuals better equipped for survival than others. In the context of natural selection, fitness refers to the ability to survive and produce fertile offspring. Environmental pressures will essentially “weed out” the unfit and result in a population that has accumulated favorable traits. One well-known example of natural selection in the healthcare industry is how the overuse of antibiotics has led to “superbugs”; bacteria that are more resistant to antibiotics than previous species. Therefore, Option B . The bacteria of current populations have more antibiotic resistance genes than previous generations is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. The bacteria were exposed to a high number of the human population – This option is incorrect because exposure to humans is not guaranteed to lead to evolution through natural selection. There must be pressures placed on the bacteria that lead to natural selection taking place. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect. Option C. The bacteria developed antibiotic resistance under Hardy-Weinberg conditions – This option is incorrect because evolution does not occur under Hardy-Weinberg conditions. Conditions that result in Hardy-Weinberg conditions are listed as follows: large population size (decrease the effect of genetic drift), no mutations, no natural selection, no gene flow, and random mating. It is important to note that Hardy-Weinberg conditions are impossible to meet in nature. Under Hardy-Weinberg conditions, we can see that no evolution is taking place and therefore, this answer choice is incorrect. Option D. The bacteria developed antibiotic resistance when in culture with already resistant bacteria – This option is incorrect because this is an example of conjugation. Conjugation is a form of horizontal gene transfer in which bacteria can exchange plasmids, which are short, circular DNA that contain genes that help survival. In conjugation, bacteria form pili bridges with other bacteria to exchange plasmids. In this manner, a bacterium can gain an antibiotic resistance gene from other resistant bacteria with this gene. Conjugation is not an example of natural selection because it does not occur over successive generations. Conjugation occurs within the same generation. Option E. The bacteria have less genetic diversity than their ancestors – This option is incorrect because natural selection requires genetic diversity. In fact, reduced genetic diversity, such as in Hardy-Weinberg conditions, will prohibit natural selection and evolution.",

      "concept_text": "Let us briefly review the light-dependent reactions . The goal of this set of reactions is to produce ATP and NADPH to drive the Calvin Cycle’s synthesis of glucose. The light-dependent reactions that produce these molecules occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. This set of reactions uses the energy from photons to energize electrons so that they move through the electron transport chain to generate an electrochemical gradient. This gradient of protons is used to generate ATP via chemiosmosis while the resulting high-energy electrons at the end of the transport chain are used to reduce the electron carrier s NADP to NADPH. It is important to note that the ATP produced from the light-dependent reactions is not used to power the cell. It is only used in the Calvin cycle in order to synthesize glucose. The electrons that flow through the electron transport chain are replenished by the hydrolysis of H 2 O to O 2 , which releases electrons into the chain and protons into the thylakoid lumen. Therefore, Option B . NADPH + O 2 is the correct answer. Together, all of the ATP and NADPH produced from the light-dependent reactions are used to drive the light-independent reactions of the Calvin Cycle to synthesize glucose from CO 2 .

      "concept_text": "To solve this question, we must first recognize that the cell does not have a cell wall, therefore, it must be an animal cell. Next, we must examine the effects of tonicity, as shown in the diagram below. CC BY 4.0 An animal cell in a hypertonic solution will shrivel because water will flow out of the cell where water is less concentrated and solute concentration is higher. Water will always flow from low to high solute concentration (or high to low water concentration) through a process known as ‘osmosis’. This makes the solute and water concentrations equal on both sides of a semi-permeable membrane. There will be no additional flow of water into or out of a cell in an isotonic solution because there is no water or solute gradient. Animal cells will be in balance in an isotonic solution. An animal cell in a hypotonic solution will lyse (swell and burst) because water will flow into the cell. Water is less concentrated inside of the cell due to a greater solute concentration. Therefore, Option B . Hypotonic is the correct answer. Canadian DAT Pro Tip : In plants, the presence of a rigid cell wall plays a role in stabilizing the cell. In hypotonic solutions, the presence of the rigid cell wall prevents the plant cell from lysing as an animal cell otherwise would. The cell wall secures the cell as it presses against it which results in a turgid plant cell. This turgidity contributes to a plant’s ability to stand straight up against gravity. It is for this reason that plants tend to straighten up after they are watered. Animal cells prefer an isotonic environment while plant cells prefer a hypotonic environment.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Hypertonic– This option is incorrect because a hypertonic solution would have a higher solute concentration than the intracellular fluid. Therefore, water would rush out of the cell to make the extracellular environment less concentrated with solutes. This will cause the cell to shrink. Option C. Isotonic – This option is incorrect because in an isotonic solution, there would be equal concentrations of solute inside and outside of the cell which would result in no net fluid movement in either direction. Therefore, the cell will not change in size. Option D. Isometric – This option is incorrect because this is not a term that relates to tonicity, but rather, a physiological term relating to or denoting muscular action in which tension is developed without contraction of the muscle. Option E. Hypertrophic – This option is incorrect. Hypertrophy refers to an increase in the size of an organ or tissue.

Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol It can occur under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. It is important to note that glycolysis itself is an anaerobic process. The fate of the pyruvate depends on the presence or absence of oxygen. If oxygen were not present, the resulting pyruvate from glycolysis will regenerate NAD + through a process known as ‘ fermentation ’. Here, pyruvate is converted to lactic acid or ethanol depending on the particular cell. In the process, NADH is oxidized back to NAD + . This regenerates NAD + necessary for further glycolysis to occur. When oxygen is present, pyruvate will be shuttled into the mitochondrial matrix where it will undergo pyruvate manipulations .
