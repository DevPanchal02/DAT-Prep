The Q10 value, more specifically, tells us how the rate of biological processes changes when an organism’s internal temperature shifts by 10°C. In this question, the Q10 value of an organism is 2. Hence, if the internal temperature of this organism increases by 10°C, its metabolic rate will double. On the other hand, if the internal temperature of this organism decreases by 10°C, its metabolic rate will decrease by half. Since Option D is the only option that correctly describes an organism with a Q10 value of 2, therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. The organism is an ectotherm – This option is incorrect because the Q10 value of an organism does not tell us whether an organism is an ectotherm or an endotherm. The Q10 value of an organism tells us how its biological processes  change based on its internal temperature. Ectotherms, also known as “cold-blooded” animals, are dependent on external sources of body heat. Endotherms, also known as “warm-blooded” animals, generate their own body heat. Hence, we can distinguish between ectotherms and endotherms based on how an organism obtains body heat. Option B. The amount of oxygen the organism absorbs at 20°C is half of that at 40°C – This option is incorrect because the Q10 value given in the question does not match the Q10 value of this option. The Q10 value of an organism tells us how the rate of biological processes changes when an organism’s internal temperature shifts by 10°C. If the Q10 value was 2 as given in the question, the amount of oxygen absorbed at 20°C should be a quarter of that at 40°C, since the temperature shifted by 20°C. However, since the amount of oxygen absorbed at 20°C was only half of that at 40°C, this option is incorrect. Option C. The amount of heat released by the organism at 20°C is twice that at 30°C – This option is incorrect because the Q10 value given in the question does not match the Q10 value suggested by this option. The Q10 value of an organism tells us how the rate of biological processes changes when an organism’s internal temperature shifts by 10°C. If the Q10 value was 2, as given in the question, the amount of heat released at 20°C should be half that at 30°C, since the temperature shifted by 10°C.

The chemical equation for photosynthesis is shown below: CC BY 4.0 Photosynthesis can be broken down into two main phases: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (the Calvin cycle) . During the light-dependent reactions, light energy is used to produce ATP and NADPH, both of which are directly used in the light-independent reactions. The light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle, is the second phase of photosynthesis. The Calvin cycle involves the fixing of 6 CO 2 molecules into 1 organic glucose molecule. The Calvin cycle can be broken down into 4 steps: The overall chemical equation for the Calvin cycle is: 6CO 2 + 18ATP + 12NADPH → 18ADP + 18P i + 12NADP+ + 1glucose Since the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) involve the fixing of CO 2 into glucose, therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Oxaloacetate is converted into citrate – This option is incorrect because citrate is converted into oxaloacetate during the  Krebs cycle. Recall that the Krebs cycle is the third step of aerobic cellular respiration. During the Krebs cycle, acetyl-CoA joins oxaloacetate to form citrate. This leads to a cascade of other steps that ultimately result in the following net products (for every 1 glucose): 4 CO 2 , 6 NADH, 2 FADH 2 , and 2 GTP. Option C. An electrochemical gradient leads to the phosphorylation of ATP molecules – This option is incorrect because this process occurs during the light-dependent reactions, instead of the light-independent reactions. Recall that during the light-dependent reactions, an electron transport chain is used to create a proton gradient (electrochemical gradient). An enzyme known as ATP synthase will utilize this proton gradient to phosphorylate ADP into ATP via chemiosmosis. Option D. Hexokinase phosphorylates a glucose molecule – This option is incorrect because this process occurs during glycolysis of aerobic cellular respiration, instead of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. Recall that glycolysis is the first step of aerobic cellular respiration. It should also be noted that glycolysis is paired with fermentation to produce ATP while oxygen is absent. Glycolysis is a process by which glucose is broken down to yield a net of 2 pyruvate, 2 ATP, and 2 NADH. The first step of glycolysis involves the phosphorylation of glucose via hexokinase to produce glucose-6-phosphate. Option E. NADH is oxidized into NAD + – This option is incorrect because the electron carrier NADH is not used during photosynthesis, and is not found in the chloroplast. During photosynthesis, NADPH is used as an electron carrier. During the light-independent reactions, NADPH is oxidized into NADP + . The electron carrier NADH is instead used during cellular respiration.",

Since there are 18 red flowers in a population of 200, the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals is 9% or 0.09. Since there are 84 pink flowers in a population of 200, the frequency of heterozygous individuals is 42% or 0.42. Although we are not directly given the number of white flowers, we can calculate the number of white flowers by subtracting the number of red and pink flowers from the total population. Subtracting 18 and 84 from 200 gives us 98. Since there are 98 white flowers in a population of 200, the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals is 49% or 0.49. Using these frequencies, we can calculate the frequency of the dominant and recessive alleles in the population. As shown above, the frequency of the dominant allele can be expressed as “p” and the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals can be expressed as “p2”. Hence, the frequency of the dominant allele will be √0.09  or 0.3. Similarly, the frequency of the recessive allele can be expressed as “q” and the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals can be expressed as “q2”. Hence, the frequency of the recessive allele will be √0.49  or 0.7. Since the frequency of the dominant allele is 0.3, therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",

      "concept_text": "The promoter sequence is a sequence of nucleotides on a DNA strand that RNA polymerase will bind to, just upstream of the gene being transcribed. “Upstream” describes the direction opposite of transcription. RNA polymerase binds to the promoter sequence in order to initiate transcription.The promoter sequence is usually a sequence of adenine (A) and thymine (T) nucleotides since adenine and thymine only bond to each other via 2 hydrogen bonds. Recall that cytosine and guanine bond to each other via 3 hydrogen bonds. Therefore, the bond strength between adenine and thymine is weaker than cytosine and guanine, making it an easier location to unwind the DNA double-helix. Both eukaryotes and prokaryotes possess promoter regions. Prokaryotic promoters are generally much more simple than eukaryotic promoters. RNA polymerase is able to directly bind to prokaryotic promoters. Prokaryotes commonly possess -35 and -10 elements. These numbers (-35 and -10) correlate to the number of nucleotides upstream of the transcription starting site. Remember, promoters are NOT the starting site, but rather, exist just upstream of the starting site. Hence, these elements are crucial for RNA polymerase recognition and binding. In eukaryotes, the promoter sequence is often more complex and larger than in prokaryotes. RNA polymerase is unable to directly bind to eukaryotic promoters and therefore, require the binding of transcription factors. Transcription factors are proteins that regulate the rate of transcription. These proteins bind to promoters and upregulate or downregulate transcription. One very common eukaryotic promoter sequence is known as the TATA box which assists in positioning the RNA polymerase at the start site. The TATA box is a region containing a repeating sequence of A and T nucleotides. Since both prokaryotes and eukaryotes possess a promoter sequence, therefore, Option A is the correct answer. Below is an image that shows the promoter region in prokaryotes: CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Protein translation occurs in the cytosol for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes – This option is incorrect because this statement is true. Translation is the conversion of messenger RNA (mRNA) into a protein via a ribosome. Protein translation occurs in the cytosol of the cell in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the ribosomes may be free floating in the cytosol or attached to the surface of the rough ER. Option C. Eukaryotic ribosomes are 80S and prokaryotic ribosomes are 70S – This option is incorrect because this statement is true. Ribosomes are organelles responsible for translating a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence into a protein. Ribosomes are made from two ribosomal subunits. Prokaryotic ribosomes are made from a 30S subunit and a 50S subunit, forming a 70S ribosome. Eukaryotic ribosomes are made from a 40S subunit and a 60S subunit, forming a 80S ribosome. The ‘S’ refers to svedberg units. Essentially, the greater the svedberg unit, the larger the molecule. Therefore, 80S ribosomes are larger than 70S ribosomes. Option D. RNA polymerase is necessary for transcription in eukaryotes and prokaryotes – This option is incorrect because RNA polymerase is required during transcription in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. RNA polymerase is responsible for binding to the promoter sequence and reading the DNA template strand in the 3’ to 5’ direction. However, nucleotides will be extended in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The mRNA strand that the RNA polymerase synthesizes is complementary to the template strand. Option E. Transcription and translation are simultaneous in prokaryotes but not eukaryotes – This option is incorrect because prokaryotes can carry out transcription and translation simultaneously, while eukaryotes cannot. Recall that in eukaryotes, transcription occurs in the nucleus and translation occurs in the cytoplasm. In prokaryotes, both transcription and translation occur in the cytoplasm (prokaryotes lack a nucleus). This allows prokaryotes to carry out transcription and translation simultaneously.",

When apoptosis occurs, the unnecessary cells that cause webbing die off, eventually allowing the fingers and toes to separate.",

      "concept_text": "Erythroblastosis fetalis is a condition where the immune system of a pregnant mother attacks the red blood cells (erythrocytes) of her fetus and destroys them (hemolysis). This occurs when the blood type of the mother is incompatible with that of the fetus. There are two possible incompatibilities: Rh incompatibility and ABO incompatibility. Out of these two, Rh incompatibility is the most common inducer of erythroblastosis fetalis. Rh , also known as Rhesus Factor , is an antigen that is found on the surface of red blood cells, similar to the A and B antigens. It is a dominant autosomal trait, and its presence is denoted by a positive (+) or Rh+ blood type whereas the lack of this Rh factor is denoted by a negative (-) or Rh- blood type. Being an antigen, Rh factor can induce an immune response if introduced in individuals that have a (-) blood type.  Erythroblastosis fetalis occurs when a mother is Rh- and the fetus is Rh+. If during the pregnancy, an event leads to the mixing of maternal and fetal blood (oftentimes a ruptured placenta), the mother’s body will recognize the Rhesus factor as foreign and begin to produce antibodies against the Rh antigen. In the vast majority of cases, during the first pregnancy, both the mother and the baby survive because the immune system has not had sufficient time to produce enough antibodies. However, if the Rh- mother were to become pregnant again with another Rh+ fetus, catastrophic problems can arise. The mother’s Rh antibodies are able to cross the placenta and attack the Rh+ red blood cells of the fetus, leading to destruction or hemolysis of the red blood cells and ultimately, anemia in the fetus. Since erythroblastosis fetalis is a result of Rh- blood from the mother interacting with Rh+ blood of the fetus, therefore, Option A is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Rh-positive blood from the mother interacts with Rh-negative blood from the baby – This option is incorrect because if the mother were Rh+, her body would not recognize Rh antigens as foreign and therefore, would not produce antibodies against Rh antigens. In addition, since the fetus is Rh-, it does not possess the Rh antigen that can trigger an immune response. The mother would not respond adversely to the introduction of the fetus’ blood into her circulation. Option C. Rh-negative blood from the mother interacts with Rh-positive blood from the father – This option is incorrect because erythroblastosis fetalis is a condition resulting from the mixing of maternal and fetal blood, NOT the mixing of maternal and paternal blood. In this case, we know nothing about the fetus’ blood type and cannot make a conclusion as to whether or not erythroblastosis fetalis is a possibility or not. Option D. Rh-positive blood from the father interacts with Rh-negative blood from the baby – This option is incorrect because erythroblastosis fetalis is a condition resulting from the mixing of maternal and fetal blood, NOT the mixing of paternal and fetal blood. Option E. Rh-negative blood from the mother interacts with Rh-negative blood from the baby – This option is incorrect because in this case, the mother and fetus share the same Rh blood type. Hence, there would be no adverse reaction to the mixing of blood because the Rh antigen is not present in the maternal or fetal blood.",

      "concept_text": "Gametes are haploid male or female germ cells that combine with another gamete of an opposite sex in order to form a diploid zygote. The fusion of two haploid gametes is referred to as fertilization. Gametes undergo random fertilization in which the sperm randomly selects an egg to fertilize. In this question, there is an organism with a genotype AaBBccDd. Since the organism has two copies of the same gene (two As, two Bs, two Cs, two Ds), we can infer that the organism is diploid. While the organism itself is diploid, the gametes it produces following meiosis must be haploid, since two haploid gametes combine to form one diploid zygote. Therefore, the gametes of this organism must contain a single copy of every gene. For example, a gamete of this organism can contain either the “A” allele or the “a” allele. Hence, there are two possibilities for the A/a gene. Similarly, a gamete of this organism can contain either the ”D” allele or the ”d” allele. Hence, there are two possibilities for the D/d gene. On the other hand, a gamete of this organism can only have the ”B” allele and the ”c” allele. The ”b” allele and the “C” allele are not viable options, since the genotype of the organism does not contain those alleles. Now, we can multiply the “possibilities” for each gene to calculate the number of possible allele combinations. By multiplying 2, 2, 1, and 1, we get 4. Hence, there are four possible allele combinations for the organism.

      "concept_text": "The thyroid gland is an organ of the endocrine system. The thyroid gland is situated in front of the trachea and is responsible for the production and secretion of 3 primary hormones into the circulation: triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and calcitonin. Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are both tyrosine-derived hormones. First, the hypothalamus will secrete thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which will signal the anterior pituitary to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH will then signal the thyroid gland to secrete T3 and T4. T3 and T4 are responsible for increasing basal metabolic rate (BMR), as well as growth and neurological development in children. Thyroxine (T4 has one more iodine atom than triiodothyronine (T3. T4 is found in greater abundance within circulation, but T3 is the active form of the thyroid hormone. Once T4 has reached its target tissue, it will be converted into the active form, T3. Calcitonin is a peptide hormone that is secreted from the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland. Calcitonin functions to decrease calcium (Ca 2+ ) levels in the blood by increasing osteoblast (bone-building cells) activity and decreasing osteoclast (bone-chewing cells) activity and proliferation. Since the thyroid gland is responsible for the secretion of thyroxine (T4), therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",

Antidiuretic hormone is responsible for adding aquaporins (water channels) on the collecting duct of the nephron. This leads to an increase in water reabsorption during times of dehydration. Option D. Prolactin – This option is incorrect because prolactin is a peptide hormone that is secreted from the anterior pituitary gland, not the thyroid gland. Prolactin stimulates milk production in females from the mammary gland after childbirth. Suckling stimulates the hypothalamus, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to release prolactin. Option E. Cortisol – This option is incorrect because cortisol is a glucocorticoid (steroid hormone) that is secreted from the adrenal cortex. Cortisol is secreted during times of long-term stress and will increase blood glucose levels by stimulating gluconeogenesis in the liver. Cortisol also breaks down adipose tissue into glycerol and fatty acids for energy and suppresses the immune system.",

Meiosis occurs in germ cells in order to produce gametes. Meiosis occurs in two phases: Meiosis I and meiosis II can each be broken down further into subphases: At the start of meiosis I, cells have 46 chromosomes and 92 chromatids. During metaphase I, chromosomes double as they form tetrads (a structure of two homologous chromosomes attached together). However, during anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes separate. The splitting of homologous chromosomes allows chromosome/chromatid numbers to go back to their original state. Hence, during anaphase I, cells have 46 chromosomes and 92 chromatids. Once meiosis I terminates and the cells split, each cell will have 23 chromosomes and 46 chromatids. At the start of meiosis II, cells have 23 chromosomes and 46 chromatids. During anaphase II, sister chromatids separate. The splitting of sister chromatids results in cells having 46 chromosomes and 46 chromatids. Hence, during anaphase II, cells have 46 chromosomes and 46 chromatids. Once meiosis II terminates and the cells split, each cell will have 23 chromosomes and 23 chromatids . The below table can be used to memorize human chromosome and chromatid count, although having a conceptual understanding is ideal because the exam can ask you about organisms with chromosome counts that differ from a human.

As the first line of defense, the innate immune response will attack anything the immune system recognizes as foreign.If the innate immune system is not sufficient to deter a threat, the adaptive immune system kicks in. The adaptive immune system, as the name suggests, is a specific response that targets certain antigens. Lymphocytes, specifically B and T cells, are an essential component of the adaptive immune system. For this question, we need to understand that B cells are responsible for producing the antibodies that attack foreign antigens. The plasma membrane of B cells contain antigen-receptor antibodies that are produced in response to antigens. Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that are specific to each antigen. These proteins have constant and variable regions, with disulfide bonds connecting heavy and light chains. There are five classes of antibodies: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, and IgD. When a B cell binds to a foreign antigen, it will proliferate and form two different types of daughter B cells: plasma cells and memory cells. Plasma cells are B cells that circulate in the blood. These cells release specific free antibodies that dispose of antigens through a variety of methods. Memory cells , on the other hand, are long-lived B cells that do not release antibodies directly, but will rapidly proliferate into plasma cells when encountering a previously seen foreign pathogen.

      "concept_text": "Flower-bearing plants , also known as angiosperms , are the dominant land plant form. Fruits, maple, oaks, and grass are common examples of angiosperms. These plants contain an ovary as a part of the pistil, the female reproductive structure. The ovary contains an ovule, which consists of a megaspore mother cell surrounded by integuments. This megaspore mother cell undergoes meiosis to form four haploid megaspores. One of these megaspores survives to undergo mitosis and create eight nuclei. Six of these nuclei undergo cytokinesis and form the embryo sac. This embryo sac later fuses with sperm cells to form the diploid zygote, triploid nucleus, and the endosperm. The endosperm functions to provide nutrients to the fertilized zygote. Birds, as well as other amniotes, develop an extra-embryonic membrane to support the growth of the embryo. The extra-embryonic membrane includes the chorion, allantois, amnion, and yolk sac. In birds and reptiles, the yolk sac specifically functions to transfer nutrients to the embryo, through blood vessels. The yolk sac also helps digest enclosed yolk. Since flower-bearing plants and birds both have an abundant nutrient sac that provides for the developing embryo, therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Colorful patterns to attract mates – This option is incorrect because while birds often have colorful patterns to attract mates, flower-bearing plants do not attract mates directly. Colorful patterns on flowers instead attract pollinators like insects and hummingbirds that facilitate the fertilization process. Pollinators are animals that move pollen from the male reproductive structure (anther) of a flower to the female reproductive structure (pistil). These animals are necessary for the fertilization of plant gametes. Option C. E ngage in both sexual and asexual reproduction – This option is incorrect because birds engage in sexual reproduction only . In other words, they form diploid zygotes through the fusion of male and female gametes. It is important to note that while most plants reproduce sexually, some plants are capable of reproducing asexually. Nonetheless, because both modes of reproduction are not used by both organisms, this answer choice cannot be correct. Option D. Courtship behaviors for mating – This option is incorrect because while birds demonstrate courtship behaviors for mating, flower-bearing plants do not. Courtship is the behavior of animals aimed at attracting a mate, typically of the same species. In the case of birds, it is usually the male birds that display courtship behaviors to be selected by the female birds. Option E. Alternation between haploid and diploid forms – This option is incorrect because  while flower-bearing plants alternate between haploid and diploid forms, birds do not. In plants, meiosis that occurs inside the sporangia produces haploid spores. These spores undergo mitosis to form multicellular, haploid gametophytes. These gametophytes can then fuse to produce diploid cells that develops into sporophytes via mitosis. The cells in the sporangia of the sporophyte undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores, which germinate and repeat the life cycle, known as “alternation of generations”. In contrast, birds never have a haploid “form” or stage in their lifecycle – do not confuse the gametes produced during meiosis with a haploid life stage, as unlike gametophytes in plants, gametes are not considered full organisms.",

      "concept_text": "Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of an organism. Point mutation is a type of mutation in which a single nucleotide change causes either substitution, insertion, or deletion. Substitution refers to a nucleotide being exchanged with a different nucleotide, insertion refers to the introduction of a completely new nucleotide, and deletion refers to the elimination of a nucleotide. Insertion and deletion can lead to a frameshift mutation. A frameshift mutation is a type of mutation that disrupts the reading frame of the DNA sequence. When the number of nucleotides that is inserted or deleted is not divisible by three, the reading frame is changed, causing an incorrect translation. These nucleotide changes can lead to changes in the amino acid that is subsequently translated, and their effect on the protein can be categorized as well . Silent mutations happen when a mutation occurs, but the new codon still codes for the same amino acid. Since there is no significant change to the translated protein, this mutation is “silent”. Nonsense mutations happen when the new codon codes for a stop codon, terminating translation. Missense mutations happen when a new codon codes for a different amino acid, possibly resulting in minor or fatal effects. Sickle cell anemia is caused by a missense mutation. A point mutation from A to T causes the valine amino acid to be synthesized instead of glutamic acid. Since a new codon is coding for a completely different amino acid, this is an example of missense mutation. This change affects the folding of hemoglobin, which leads to the production of “crescent” or “sickle-shaped” red blood cells.  These modified red blood cells can hinder blood flow, since they are incapable of carrying sufficient amounts of oxygen. Since sickle cell anemia is caused by a missense mutation, therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Nonsense – This option is incorrect because sickle cell anemia is caused by a missense mutation, not a nonsense mutation. A nonsense mutation happens when a new codon codes for a stop codon, terminating translation and resulting in a prematurely shortened protein. In the case of sickle cell anemia, the new codon does not code for a stop codon; instead, it codes for a different amino acid (valine instead of glutamic acid). Option C. Frameshift – This option is incorrect because sickle cell anemia is caused by a missense mutation, not a frameshift mutation. A frameshift mutation is a type of mutation that disrupts the reading frame of the DNA sequence. When the number of nucleotides that is inserted or deleted is not divisible by three, the reading frame is changed.  This change causes amino acids to be incorrectly translated from the nucleotide sequence. Hence, in order for a frameshift mutation to occur, nucleotides must be inserted or deleted from the original DNA sequence. However, in  the case of sickle cell anemia, a single nucleotide is being replaced by a different nucleotide, conserving the number of nucleotides. Option D. Silent – This option is incorrect because sickle cell anemia is caused by a missense mutation, not a silent mutation. A silent mutation happens when a mutation occurs, but the new codon still codes for the same amino acid . Silent mutations are possible because multiple codons can code for the same amino acid due to redundancy in the genetic code. For example, the codon UUC and UUU both code for phenylalanine. Silent mutations ultimately have no effect on protein structure or function, since the protein remains identical. In the case of sickle cell anemia, the new codon codes for a completely different amino acid (valine instead of glutamic acid), causing red blood cells to change in shape. Option E. Deletion – This option is incorrect because sickle cell anemia is caused by a missense mutation, not deletion. Deletion refers to the elimination of a nucleotide from the DNA sequence. In the case of sickle cell anemia, there are no nucleotides being deleted from the original DNA sequence.

      "concept_text": "Recall that diploid (2n) cells are cells that contain two complete sets of chromosomes. In other words, diploid cells possess homologous chromosome pairs, one from the father and one from the mother. Humans are diploid organisms which means our somatic cells have two sets of chromosomes. In contrast, haploid (n) cells are cells that possess a single set of unpaired chromosomes. When diploid germ cells undergo meiosis, their daughter cells (gametes) are haploid. For this question, we need to understand a concept known as alternation of generations. Alternation of generations is a life cycle that’s observed in certain organisms like plants, fungi, and some protists. Alternation of generations is a process by which an organism will alternate between diploid (2n) and haploid (n) stages. While this process is a cycle, let’s begin in the sporophyte stage. Sporophytes are diploid and possess structures known as sporangia. When sporangia undergo meiosis, they produce haploid spores. These haploid spores will undergo mitosis to become a multicellular gametophyte that is still haploid (recall the spores that underwent mitosis to produce the gametophyte are haploid). The gametophyte is responsible for producing gametes which we should know are haploid. When two gametes fuse during fertilization, it produces a diploid zygote. This zygote will then undergo mitosis to become a multicellular diploid sporophyte. We’ve now finished the complete cycle! Fungi are eukaryotic heterotrophs that are capable of alternating between haploid and diploid stages, however, the haploid stage predominates during the life of a fungus. It’s also important to note that because fungi are eukaryotic, their cells contain a nucleus. Since fungi contain nucleated cells and have a predominantly haploid life cycle, therefore, Option B is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Angiosperms – This option is incorrect because while angiosperms have nucleated cells, they have a predominantly diploid life cycle. Angiosperms are flower-bearing plants. Examples of angiosperms include fruits, maple, oaks, and grass. Recall that the flower is the reproductive structure of angiosperms, and it is broken down into 3 components: the pistil, the stamen, and the petals. Most angiosperms alternate between the haploid and diploid stages throughout their life. While angiosperms are capable of alternation of generations, they spend the majority of their life cycle in the diploid stage. Option C. Gymnosperms – This option is incorrect because while gymnosperms have nucleated cells, they have a predominantly diploid life cycle. Gymnosperms are cone-bearing vascular plants. Examples of gymnosperms include pines, firs, spruces, junipers, redwoods, and cedars. The seeds of gymnosperms are not protected and are therefore referred to as ‘naked seeds’. Most gymnosperms alternate between the haploid and diploid stages throughout their life. While gymnosperms are capable of alternation of generations, the majority of their life cycle is spent in the diploid stage. Option D. Queen bees – This option is incorrect because while queen bees have nucleated cells, they are diploid organisms. Queen bees, along with all other female bees, are diploid (one chromosome set from the mother and one from the father). Male bees, on the other hand, are haploid (one chromosome set from the mother).  This is possible because male bees hatch from haploid, unfertilized eggs, while female bees hatch from diploid, fertilized eggs. Female bees produce male eggs by allowing a pronucleus (haploid nucleus before fusion) to undergo mitosis and develop into a male haploid egg. This process of reproduction from unfertilized eggs is called parthenogenesis. Option E. Tracheophytes – This option is incorrect because while tracheophytes have nucleated cells, they have a predominantly diploid life cycle. Tracheophytes are plants that contain vascular tissue (xylem and phloem). Recall that the xylem is responsible for the transportation of water and minerals while the phloem is responsible for the transportation of sugar. These plants also have true roots, leaves, and stems. Tracheophytes alternate between the haploid and diploid stages throughout their life. While tracheophytes are capable of alternation of generations, the majority of their life cycle is spent in the diploid stage.",

Reverse transcriptase is an essential enzyme of retroviruses (like HIV) because retroviruses have an RNA genome. Retroviruses must convert their RNA genome to DNA in order to integrate their genetic material into the host cell’s genome. The DNA that is synthesized by reverse transcriptase is called complementary DNA (cDNA) . Since cDNA is reverse engineered from an RNA transcript, it contains no introns. Reverse transcriptase is also used for a molecular biological process known as Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) . RT-PCR is utilized by molecular biologists to amplify RNA targets after reverse transcription is complete. RT-PCR is often paired with quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure gene expression.

RNA Polymerase – This option is incorrect because RNA polymerase is not responsible for converting RNA to DNA. RNA polymerase is an essential enzyme for DNA transcription, which is the conversion of DNA to RNA. During transcription, RNA polymerase will bind to the promoter, located near the transcription start site, to initiate transcription. Once RNA polymerase is in the correct position, it will read the DNA strand in the 3’ to 5’ direction, but add nucleotides in the 5’ to 3’ direction. Option D.

Some characteristics of apoptosis include cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and many more. Apoptosis plays an integral role in the development of the nervous system, as well as the operation of the immune system. Apoptosis also contributes to embryonic development. For instance, apoptosis removes the webbing between fetal fingers and toes. When apoptosis occurs, the unnecessary cells that cause webbing die off, eventually allowing the fingers and toes to separate. Since apoptosis is the process that causes the webbing between human fingers to disappear during embryonic development, therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",

Splicing is a process that removes portions of the RNA sequence and connects the remaining portions together. Eukaryotic RNA sequences are composed of exons and introns. Exons are protein-coding sequences, whereas introns are non-coding sequences that “interrupt” in the sequence of a gene. Hence, during splicing, introns are removed while exons are preserved. Option C. Hypertrophy – This option is incorrect because hypertrophy does not remove the webbing between human fingers during embryonic development. Hypertrophy refers to the enlargement of an organ or a tissue, due to the growth of their cells. For example, human muscle cells generally do not undergo mitosis to create more cells. They, instead, undergo hypertrophy and increase in size. This results in larger muscle fibers   and sarcomeres, as well as a greater number of sarcomeres and mitochondria. Option D. Gastrulation – This option is incorrect because gastrulation does not remove the webbing between human fingers during embryonic development. Gastrulation refers to the formation of the gastrula, approximately 14 days after fertilization. A gastrula is an embryo at the stage following the blastula. The gastrula consists of three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Gastrulation also produces the archenteron. The archenteron is the center cavity that gives rise to the gut. Option E. Conjugation – This option is incorrect because conjugation does not remove the webbing between human fingers during embryonic development. Conjugation is one of the methods used by bacteria to exchange information with one another. During conjugation, the donor bacterium produces a bridge (pilus) that connects to the recipient bacterium.

The male reproductive tract includes the seminiferous tubules, epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct, urethra, and penis (listed in the order in which sperm travels ). We can use the mnemonic SEVEn UP to memorize the path of sperm: Seminiferous tubules → Epididymis → Vas deferens → Ejaculatory duct → Urethra → Penis. Option D. Respiratory system pathways – This option is incorrect because the anatomical terms listed in the question do not describe respiratory system pathways. The respiratory system pathway starts from the nasal cavity, then the pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and ends with the alveoli.",

      "concept_text": "This question is asking about a physiological process of the nervous system known as an action potential . Action potentials are “all or nothing” events that transmit nerve signals to target neurons/tissues. Essentially, an action potential is the result of changes to the membrane potential of a neuron, due to the movement of certain ions across the membrane of that neuron. Action potentials allow the nervous system to communicate with itself, as well as target tissues. The typical resting membrane potential of a neuron is -70mV. Because this potential is not neutral (it is less than 0), the resting membrane potential is said to be polarized. Once the neuron receives a stimulus, it causes gated ion channels to open, resulting in an influx of Na+ ions. This influx of positively charged ions increases the membrane potential of the neuron, a process known as depolarization . If the stimulus is strong enough, the membrane potential will reach threshold value (-55mV) and an action potential will fire. If the stimulus is not strong enough to reach the threshold value (-55mV), no action potential will fire (not even a smaller one). This is why action potentials are said to be all or nothing events! Since a nerve cell that is stimulated below its threshold value will not be able to fire an action potential, therefore, Option A is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. An action potential will fire slower than normal – This option is incorrect because action potentials are “all or nothing” events. Only when a nerve cell reaches threshold membrane potential will a full-on action potential fire. If the nerve cell does not reach threshold value (-55mV), an action potential will NOT fire at all. There are two factors that alter the rate at which nerve impulses travel: thickness and myelination. Impulses travel faster in thicker axons because a larger diameter results in less resistance to the flow of ions. Impulses also travel faster in heavily myelinated axons. Myelination allows impulses to propagate faster because it allows for saltatory conduction, whereby action potentials can jump from node to node rather than having to depolarize channels along the entire membrane. While there are factors that affect the speed of action potentials in the axon, the level of stimulation itself cannot affect action potential speed. Option C. The nerve cell will hyperpolarize – This option is incorrect because hyperpolarization is when a nerve cell’s membrane potential reaches a value more negative than that of resting membrane potential (-70mV). Hyperpolarization occurs after repolarization because the potassium (K+) channels are slow to close. Therefore, excess potassium (K+) leaks out of the cell, causing the membrane potential of the nerve cell to drop below -70mV. Hyperpolarization may also occur from inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). In this question, it is assumed that the stimulus that the nerve cell received was excitatory; therefore, we know that the cell was NOT hyperpolarized. Option D. The nerve cell will reach a membrane potential slightly lower than max membrane potential – This option is incorrect because action potentials are “all or nothing” events. If a nerve cell reaches threshold membrane potential (-55mV), a full-on action potential will fire and reach max membrane potential (+30mV) EVERY time. If the stimulus received was not strong enough for the nerve cell to reach threshold potential, no action potential will fire at all, not even a smaller action potential.",

      "concept_text": "For this question, there are a few components that we need to recognize. First, we must remember that nucleotides are the building blocks or monomeric subunits for nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Nucleosides are composed of a deoxyribose sugar (DNA) or ribose sugar (RNA), and a nitrogenous base. Nucleotides, on the other hand, are composed of a deoxyribose sugar or ribose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and 1 phosphate group. However, when such a molecule has two phosphate groups attached, we call them nucleoside diphosphates . When three phosphates are attached, we call them nucleoside triphosphates . Hence, deoxycytidine triphosphate is a nucleoside triphosphate that contains a cytosine base. Recall that there are 5 nitrogenous bases that comprise DNA and RNA which you must know for your test: cytosine, guanine, adenine, thymine, and uracil. Both DNA and RNA are composed of cytosine, guanine, and adenine; however, DNA also contains thymine whereas thymine is replaced by uracil in RNA. We know that deoxycytidine triphosphate will end up being incorporated into DNA because of the prefix ”deoxy”. The prefix “deoxy” indicates that the molecule in question is composed of a deoxyribose sugar. Deoxyribose sugars are seen in DNA whereas ribose sugars are seen in RNA. Hence, if an active culture of fibroblasts is treated with radioactively labeled deoxycytidine triphosphate, this nucleotide would be incorporated into (and detected within) the DNA of the fibroblast. Since deoxycytidine triphosphate is a molecule that can be found in DNA, therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. cDNA – This option is incorrect because fibroblasts do not utilize reverse transcriptase and therefore do not synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA). Recall that reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that converts RNA into a cDNA strand. Reverse transcriptase is used among retroviruses because their genome is composed of RNA. They must convert their RNA genome into DNA in order to incorporate their genetic material into the host cell’s genome. Reverse transcriptase is also used amongst molecular biologists in order to amplify RNA targets using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. cDNA does not occur naturally within a cell, and would not be found in dividing fibroblasts. Option B. Protein – This option is incorrect because deoxycytidine triphosphate cannot be found in proteins. Deoxycytidine triphosphate is a nucleoside triphosphate that will end up being incorporated into DNA. Recall that amino acids are the monomeric subunits for proteins. Deoxycytidine triphosphate is not an amino acid. Option C. mRNA – This option is incorrect because deoxycytidine triphosphate cannot be found in mRNA. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a product of DNA transcription where DNA is transcribed into a messenger RNA transcript. Messenger RNA, as the name suggests, is an RNA strand. Nucleotides that comprise RNA are made of ribose sugars, which possess a hydroxyl group on the 2’ carbon. Nucleotides that comprise DNA, on the other hand, are made with deoxyribose sugars. Deoxyribose sugars do NOT possess a hydroxyl group on the 2’ carbon. Deoxycytidine triphosphate is a nucleoside triphosphate with the cytosine nitrogenous base attached to a deoxyribose sugar.

      "concept_text": "Recall that gastrulation is the embryonic developmental process by which three germ layers arise. During gastrulation, cells of the epiblast will invaginate at the primitive streak and give rise to the three embryonic germ layers. The three germ layers are listed superficial to deep as follows: the ectoderm, the mesoderm, and the endoderm. Once the three germ layers are formed, the embryo is now considered a gastrula . Cells from each of these germ layers will differentiate to form various structures and systems of the body. A list of the structures that arise from each germ layer is given below: The ectoderm will differentiate to form the nervous system (brain and spinal cord), integument (epidermis, hair, epithelium of the nose, mouth, and anal canal), sensory structures of the eyes, ears, and nose, as well as the adrenal medulla. Neural crest cells of the ectoderm will also form the teeth, jaws, and bones of the skull. The mesoderm will give rise to the musculoskeletal system, the circulatory system, the excretory system, the gonads, portions of the digestive and respiratory system, the notochord, the kidney, the dermis of the skin, the adrenal cortex, and the spleen. The endoderm will give rise to the epithelial lining of the digestive and respiratory tract, the liver, the pancreas, the gallbladder, the thyroid and parathyroid, the thymus, and the lining of the urinary bladder.

Neurulation – This option is incorrect because the three germ layers are not formed during neurulation. neurulation is an embryonic developmental process by which the notochord (derived from cells of the mesoderm) will induce the development of the spinal cord from cells of the ectoderm. Neurulation occurs after gastrulation; therefore, the three germ layers are already formed prior to neurulation. Option B. Cleavage – This option is incorrect because the three germ layers are formed after cleavage has already taken place. Recall that fertilization is the fusion of egg and sperm nuclei to create a zygote. This zygote will then undergo cleavage which is rapid cell division without cell growth. After each cellular division, the cells (blastomeres) will get smaller such that the overall mass of the embryo remains the same. Cleavage ends once the embryo has reached the ~128 cell stage, at which point that embryo is now considered a blastula. Cleavage occurs before gastrulation, meaning that the three germ layers cannot be found during cleavage. Option C. Organogenesis – This option is incorrect because the three germ layers are formed before organogenesis takes place. Organogenesis refers to the production of organs. After gastrulation, cells of each of the three germ layers will differentiate to form various organs and systems of the body. Organogenesis occurs after gastrulation; therefore, the three germ layers are already formed prior to organogenesis. Option E.

The terms ‘ protostome ’ and ‘ deuterostome ’ are used to describe certain processes that organisms undergo during embryonic development. Let’s examine these processes and how we can distinguish between protostomes and deuterostomes. All triploblastic phyla aside from Echinodermata and Chordata are protostomes. Protostomes have spiral and determinate cleavage. Determinate cleavage means that blastomeres are unable to develop into a complete embryo if they are separated. This is in contrast to indeterminate cleavage in which separated blastomeres ARE able to complete full development. In addition, protostomes possess schizocoeloms, a type of cavity that forms when mesodermal cells split apart. This cavity (coelom) is filled with mesodermal tissue. Organisms that possess a schizocoelom are said to be schizocoelous. In protostomes, the blastopore (an opening created by the invagination of the primitive streak) will develop into the mouth. On the other hand, deuterostomes undergo radial and indeterminate cleavage. Deuterostomes also possess an enterocoelom, which is a result of an outpocketing of the archenteron. When the growing surface of the archenteron pinches off, they form the enterocoelom which, similar to the schizocoelom, is filled with mesodermal tissue. Organisms that possess an enterocoelom are said to be enterocoelous. In deuterostomes, the blastopore becomes the anus. Recall that humans are deuterostomes!

These cavities are filled with mesodermal tissue. Unlike deuterostomes, protostomes are schizocoelous because they possess a schizocoelom. Option C. Spiral cleavage – This option is incorrect because deuterostomes exhibit radial cleavage, not spiral cleavage. Spiral cleavage results in determinate cells.

Human blood is composed of plasma, white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. The plasma is an aqueous mixture of nutrients, salts, gases, wastes, hormones, and blood proteins. Despite the similarity in name, blood plasma is completely different from the genetic material plasmids. clotting.",

Once DNA samples are loaded onto slots on the gel, an electric current is applied to allow the samples to travel through the permeable gel . After separating the DNA samples, it can be sequenced or probed to find the location of specific sequences. During gel electrophoresis, DNA molecules are separated primarily by size  . The smaller the molecule, the farther it travels down the gel. In other words, shorter DNA fragments travel through the gel faster than longer DNA fragments during gel electrophoresis. Smaller molecules travel farther down the gel because they can easily navigate through the pores of the gel, without encountering significant resistance – unlike larger molecules, which are more restricted in their movement. Since the 3kb fragment is smaller than the 10kb fragment, and smaller molecules travel faster through the gel, therefore, Option C is the correct answer.",

Both DNA and RNA strands are made of repeating units called nucleotides. Nucleotides contain a phosphate group, a sugar molecule, and a nitrogenous base. While DNA and RNA nucleotides have the same phosphate group, they differ primarily in their sugar molecule. DNA is made up of deoxyribose sugar, whereas RNA is made up of ribose sugar . Deoxyribose and ribose are both five-carbon sugars, but deoxyribose has a hydrogen atom attached to its second carbon, while ribose has a hydroxyl group at the same position. Both DNA and RNA contain nitrogenous bases (although DNA contains thymine, while RNA contains uracil). In both DNA and RNA, phosphate groups and sugars combine to form the sugar-phosphate backbone.

The cerebral cortex processes sensory input, and is essential for perception, memory, voluntary movement, and learning. The limbic system contains the hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and amygdala. The hippocampus is responsible for memory formation. The thalamus relays sensory information between the spinal cord and the cerebral cortex. The hypothalamus is responsible for involuntary visceral functions such as blood pressure regulation and temperature regulation.

The basal ganglia functions as the center for planning, as well as learning of movement sequences. The olfactory bulb is responsible for the recognition of smell. The midbrain is located at the brainstem, between the forebrain and the hindbrain. It functions as the relay center for visual and auditory impulses, as well as motor control.

      "concept_text": "Action potentials are “all or nothing” events that transmit nerve signals to target neurons/tissues. Essentially, an action potential is the result of changes to the membrane potential of a neuron due to the movement of certain ions across the membrane of that neuron. The typical resting membrane potential of a neuron is -70mV. Because this potential is not neutral (it is less than 0), the resting membrane potential is said to be polarized. Once the neuron receives a stimulus, it causes voltage-gated ion channels to open, resulting in an influx of Na + ions. This influx of positively charged ions increases the membrane potential of the neuron, a process known as depolarization . If the stimulus is strong enough, the membrane potential will reach threshold value (-55mV) and an action potential will fire. When an action potential fires, voltage-gated Na + channels open along the entire length of the neuron, leading to a large influx of Na + ions. This leads to the membrane potential reaching a maximum value of ~30mV. Once this maximum value is reached, Na + channels become inactivated, while K + ion channels open. The opening of K + ion channels allows for the efflux of K + ions out of the cell. This efflux of K + restores polarization of the neuron; a process known as repolarization . However, the K + channels are slow to close; therefore, too much K + is released and the membrane potential stoops lower than -70mV, a process known as hyperpolarization . This period of time is brief and eventually, resting membrane potential is restored. Since repolarization is a period of time where K + channels are open, leading to an efflux of K + ions out of the cell, therefore, Option B is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",

During repolarization, K + channels open, leading to an efflux of K + ions out of the cell. This will lead to a decrease in membrane potential of the neuron, which will return the neuron to resting membrane potential (-70mV). Na + channels are open during depolarization, not repolarization. Option C. Na + channels open, leading to an efflux of Na + out of the cell – This option is incorrect because Na + channels do not open during repolarization.

Furthermore, the opening of Na + channels will not lead to an efflux of Na + out of the cell because voltage-gated Na + channels only facilitate the influx of Na + . It is important to note that voltage-gated ion channels let Na + into the cell and K + out of the cell. Option D.

The placenta is one of the extraembryonic membranes that develop during the embryonic developmental process. The placenta is a blend of maternal and embryonic tissue by which gases, nutrients, and wastes are exchanged. In addition to being a site of material exchange, the placenta continues to produce chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) throughout pregnancy, helping to maintain the corpus luteum. Hence, the placenta is not a structure that implants into the uterus; it instead functions to supports the developing fetus. Option D. Gastrula – This option is incorrect because the gastrula does not implant into the uterus. After the blastocyst has implanted into the uterus, it will undergo gastrulation. Gastrulation is the process by which the blastocyst will develop into a trilaminar embryo. Recall that these three germ layers are known as the ectoderm, the mesoderm, and the endoderm. Cells of each of these three germ layers will differentiate to form various structures and systems of the body. Gastrulation occurs after implantation so it would not make sense that the gastrula is the structure that implants into the uterus. Option E. Neurula – This option is incorrect because the neurula does not implant into the uterus. The neurula is a product of an embryonic developmental process known as neurulation. Neurulation is the process by which the notochord (derived from cells of the mesoderm) will induce the development of the spinal cord from cells of the ectoderm. Neurulation occurs after implantation so it would not make sense for the neurula to be the structure that implants into the uterus.",

      "concept_text": "There are three primary components of sperm: head , midpiece , and the tail . The head of the sperm contains the nucleus, which contains DNA, specifically one haploid set of chromosomes. The tip of the head also contains the acrosome, a lysosome-like organelle that contains digestive enzymes that are important for the acrosomal reaction. Recall that the acrosomal reaction is the process by which the sperm will penetrate the zona pellucida in order to bind and fertilize the egg. The midpiece of the sperm contains a significant amount of mitochondria which will provide energy for the sperm’s mobility. The tail or flagellum of the sperm, anatomy shown in the image below, is a whip-like structure that extends directly from the midpiece. The flagellum is responsible for the sperm’s mobility. After all, the sperm needs to swim up the female reproductive tract in order to reach the egg for fertilization. Since the head of the sperm contains the nucleus, which is the organelle responsible for storing DNA, therefore, Option B is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Mitochondria – This option is incorrect because mitochondria are not a part of the sperm head; they are stored in the midpiece. Recall that the sperm is made up of three primary components: the head, the midpiece, and the tail (flagellum). The midpiece is concentrated with mitochondria which produce ATP that the sperm primarily uses for mobility. Option C. Flagella – This option is incorrect because flagella are not a part of the sperm head; they are a part of the tail. Recall that the sperm is made up of three primary components: the head, the midpiece, and the tail (flagellum). The flagellum, or tail of the sperm is responsible for the sperm’s mobility. The flagellum is a whip-like structure that facilitates the swimming of the sperm through the female reproductive tract. Oftentimes, male infertility is due to dysfunctional flagella. Option D. Oogonia – This option is incorrect because oogonia are not a part of the sperm head. In fact, they are not found in the sperm at all. Oogonia are early female germ cells. Oogonia will undergo mitosis to become primary oocytes. These oocytes will then complete oogenesis in order to become an ovum (egg). Oogonia are cells of the female reproductive system, while sperm are cells of the male reproductive system. Option E. Chloroplast – This option is incorrect because chloroplasts are not found in sperm. In fact, chloroplasts are not found in any animal cell because they are only present in plant cells. Chloroplasts are specialized organelles that are responsible for photosynthesis.",

Phosphodiester bonds are covalent bonds between the phosphate of one nucleotide and the hydroxyl group of an adjacent nucleotide. These bonds link nucleotides together and form the backbone of both DNA and RNA. Based on their mode of action, two main classes have been defined: While both endonucleases and exonucleases are able to convert DNA into smaller fragments, endonuclease is the one listed in the answer choices. Since endonucleases are enzymes that are capable of converting DNA into smaller fragments, therefore, Option C is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Protease – This option is incorrect because proteases are enzymes that cleave the peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids. Recall that amino acids are the monomeric subunit of proteins. When amino acids link together via peptide bonds, it makes a polypeptide chain. This polypeptide chain is the primary structure of a protein. Proteases are responsible for the breakdown of these polypeptide chains, not nucleic acids. Option B. Lipase – This option is incorrect because lipase is an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of fats, not nucleic acids. Recall that chief cells of the stomach secrete gastric lipase and the pancreas secretes pancreatic lipase. Option D. Ligase – This option is incorrect because ligase is not responsible for cutting DNA into smaller fragments. Instead, ligase is responsible for joining DNA strands together. Recall  that during DNA replication, DNA polymerase will add nucleotides in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The lagging strand is able to add nucleotides continuously as it is adding nucleotides in the direction of the replication fork (DNA polymerase will add nucleotides in the same direction that DNA is unwinding). However, this is not the case for the lagging strand. On the lagging strand, DNA polymerase is still adding nucleotides in the 5’ to 3’ direction; however, this direction points away from the replication fork. Because of this, DNA polymerase has to keep returning to the replication fork and add nucleotides in the opposite direction that DNA is unwinding. This creates small DNA fragments known as Okazaki fragments. Ligase is an enzyme that is responsible for connecting these Okazaki fragments. It is important to note that ligase is used in DNA repair, as well as recombinant DNA technology. Option E. Catalase – This option is incorrect because catalase is not responsible for cutting DNA into smaller fragments. Recall that peroxisomes are membrane-bound organelles of eukaryotes that break down substances. Peroxisomes produce hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) in order to oxidize substrates. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) produces reactive oxygen- species (ROS), and ROS can create dangerous free radicals. Because of this, peroxisomes will utilize catalase, which is an enzyme that breaks down excess hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.",

Smooth muscles are found in the lining of the bladder, uterus, digestive tract, and blood vessels. Skeletal muscles are attached to bones and tendons. Cardiac muscles are found only in the heart. Each of these muscles has unique characteristics that distinguishes it from other muscle types. This question specifically asks about the characteristics of smooth muscles. Smooth muscles are involuntary, unstriated, and contain one central nucleus. These muscles are stimulated by the autonomic nervous system and are slow to contract. Furthermore, smooth muscles do not rely on sarcomere organization. Instead, thick and thin filaments are attached to intermediate filaments, which contract. When the intermediate filaments contract, they pull dense bodies together and the overall length of the smooth muscle shrinks. Since smooth muscles contain one central nucleus, therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Sarcomere – This option is incorrect because while skeletal and cardiac muscles have sarcomeres, smooth muscles do not rely on sarcomere organization. They instead have intermediate filaments that are attached to dense bodies spread throughout the cell . Sarcomeres are individual contractile units of a myofibril in striated muscles. These structural units are composed of thin actin filaments and thick myosin filaments that slide past one another to produce a muscular contraction. Option C. Troponin – This option is incorrect because while skeletal and cardiac muscles have troponin, smooth muscles do not. They use myosin light change kinase to overcome the lack of troponin . Troponin is an essential component of the sliding filament model. For a contraction to occur, calcium ions must first bind to troponin, pulling tropomyosin out of the way and exposing the active site on actin. The myosin head is then able to form a cross-bridge with actin. During a power stroke, this myosin head bends, releasing ADP and phosphate. Once a new ATP molecule attaches to the myosin head, the cross-bridge detaches. Option D. T-tubules – This option is incorrect because while skeletal and cardiac muscles have T-tubules, smooth muscles do not. Since smooth muscle fibers have a much smaller diameter than skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers, T-tubules are not necessary to reach the interior of the cell . Sarcolemma, the plasma membrane of muscle cells, is invaginated by T-tubules. T-tubules are channels for ion flow. During muscle contraction, the T-tubules function to transmit electrical signals throughout muscle cells by allow action potentials to transmit deeper through the muscle tissue. Option E. Intercalated discs – This option is incorrect because while cardiac muscles have intercalated discs, smooth muscles do not. Cardiac muscle cells are separated by intercalated discs that have gap junctions, allowing action potentials to flow through adjacent cells. This structure allows for rapid electric transmission and nutrient exchange among cardiac muscle cells.",

      "concept_text": "Tundras have cold winters where the ground freezes. While the top layer thaws during summer to support minimal vegetation, the deeper soil remains permanently frozen. This deeper soil is also called “permafrost”. Water cannot penetrate the permafrost layer, leading some areas to become waterlogged and anaerobic, limiting the activity of aerobic decomposers. While decomposition still takes place and dead organic matter is available, anaerobic decomposition is slower than aerobic decomposition. Thus, the cold and anaerobic environments of the tundras slow the catabolic activity of decomposers. As a result, the tundra would have the slowest rate of decomposition, therefore, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Ocean bottom – This option is incorrect because decomposition rates are slightly faster at the ocean bottom than in tundras. The ocean bottom has minimal oxygen and not enough light for photosynthesis, so most decomposers inhabiting the ocean bottom are anaerobic. However, the ocean bottom does not freeze over and has stable temperatures that are slightly higher than tundras, on average. Thus, decomposition is still slow at the ocean bottom, but it is continuous year-round, unlike tundras. Option C. Tropical rainforest – This option is incorrect because decomposition rates are significantly faster in tropical rainforests than in tundras. Tropical rainforests are the most diverse biome due to its high, but stable temperature and humidity. The high temperature and humidity also accelerate the rate of decay of dead organic matter, creating an ideal environment for decomposers. Option D. Coral reef – This option is incorrect because decomposition rates are significantly faster in coral reefs than in tundras. Coral reefs are one of the most biodiverse marine ecosystems. Hence, coral reefs contain abundant dead organic matter and diverse species of decomposers. Bacterial decomposers in coral reefs play an essential role in the nitrogen cycle, releasing essential nutrients like nitrate into the environment. Overall, the high temperatures and biodiversity of coral reefs facilitate fast decomposition rates. Option E. Grasslands – This option is incorrect because decomposition rates are significantly faster in grasslands than in the tundras. While not as biodiverse as tropical rainforests, grasslands have a relatively high biodiversity among the terrestrial biomes. Hence, grasslands contain a lot of organic matter that can be consumed by decomposers. While grasslands are relatively dry, the temperate environment favors higher rates of decomposition than tundras.",

Alternation of generations is a life cycle that’s observed in certain organisms like plants, fungi, and some protists. Alternation of generations is a process by which an organism will alternate between diploid (2n) and haploid (n) stages. While this process is a cycle, let’s begin in the sporophyte stage. Sporophytes are diploid and possess structures known as sporangia. When sporangia undergo meiosis, they produce haploid spores. These haploid spores will undergo mitosis to become a multicellular gametophyte that is still haploid (recall the spores that underwent mitosis to produce the gametophyte are haploid). The gametophyte is responsible for producing gametes which we should know are haploid. When two gametes fuse during fertilization, it produces a diploid zygote. This zygote will then undergo mitosis to become a multicellular diploid sporophyte. We’ve now finished the complete cycle!

      "concept_text": "Actin is an essential protein in eukaryotic cell biology. Actin can be used for cell motility, muscle contraction, maintaining cell shape and structure, cell division, and many more. It is also present in amoeba to form pseudopods, which are extensions of the cell membrane that allow amoeba to move and consume. Cytokinesis is a phase of cell division that begins during the later stages of mitosis. This stage involves the division of the cytoplasm to form two cells. During cytokinesis of animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms. A cleavage furrow is an indentation in the center of a dividing cell. In order to form the cleavage furrow, actin and myosin microfilaments are shortened and the plasma membrane is pulled into the center of the cell. Since actin is required to form the cleavage furrow and ultimately carry out cytokinesis, therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Chromosomes would be unable to align on the metaphase plate – This option is incorrect because actin is not used to align chromosomes on the metaphase plate. During metaphase, spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores of chromosomes in order to pull them into a single plane in the middle of the cell. These spindle fibers are made up of microtubules, which are composed of repeating units of a protein called tubulin. Actin does not contribute to the mitotic spindle. Option B . The centrosome would fail to organize the mitotic spindle – This option is incorrect because actin is not used to organize the mitotic spindle. The mitotic spindle is made up of microtubules, which are composed of repeating units of a protein called tubulin. During prophase, the mitotic spindle begins to self-assemble in the cytoplasm of the cell. Option C. Sister chromatids would remain stuck together during anaphase – This option is incorrect because actin is not used to separate the sister chromatids during anaphase. During anaphase, spindle fibers pull apart sister chromatids to opposite poles of the cell. These spindle fibers are made up of microtubules, which are composed of repeating units of a protein called tubulin. Option E. The nucleus would be unable to dissolve during prophase – This option is incorrect because actin is not used to dissolve the nucleus during prophase. During prophase, the nuclear membrane breaks down, allowing the chromosomes to be released into the cytoplasm and accessed by the spindle fibers. There are enzymes activated by the progression of the cell cycle that function to dissolve the nuclear membrane, but actin plays no role in the process.",

      "concept_text": "Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic process that creates new glucose molecules from non-carbohydrate substrates such as lipids and proteins. Gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver and kidneys, and it is an essential process for maintaining blood glucose levels, particularly when the body is fasting or exercising. In these situations, the body may not have sufficient levels of glucose to sustain ATP production, and other macromolecules must instead be utilized initially. One common example of gluconeogenesis is the Cori cycle. Recall that under anaerobic conditions, fermentation can be used to regenerate NAD + , and lactate is produced as a byproduct. When oxygen becomes available again, that lactate will enter the liver to become a substrate of the Cori cycle. The Cori cycle will convert the lactate back into pyruvate which can then be converted into glucose via gluconeogenesis. The liver will then release that glucose into the bloodstream, making it available for use by other tissues/organs. Since gluconeogenesis is a cellular process that creates glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors, therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Glycolysis – This option is incorrect because glucose is the substrate of glycolysis and glucose is a carbohydrate. Recall that glycolysis is the first step of cellular respiration by which glucose is converted into 2 ATP, 2 NADH, and 2 pyruvate. Option B. Citric Acid Cycle – This option is incorrect because the citric acid cycle does not produce glucose. The citric acid cycle occurs after the pyruvate decarboxylation step during aerobic cellular respiration. During the citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA will join oxaloacetate to ultimately produce 3 NADH, 1 GTP, 2 CO 2 , and 1 FADH 2 per acetyl-CoA molecule. Option C. Glycogenolysi s – This option is incorrect because glycogen is a substrate of glycogenolysis and glycogen is a carbohydrate. Glycogen is a storage form of glucose, and series of branched glucose polymers stored primarily in the liver and skeletal muscle. Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen in order to release usable glucose for the body. While this option may be tempting because glycogenolysis does increase glucose levels when they are low, it is an incorrect option because glycogen is a carbohydrate and the question states that no carbohydrates are available. Option E. Beta-oxidation – This option is incorrect because beta-oxidation does not produce glucose. Beta-oxidation occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. Beta-oxidation is a process by which fatty acids are cleaved to produce 2 carbon acetyl-CoA molecules. Before beta-oxidation can begin, the fatty acid chain must first be activated via an investment of 2 ATP. During each cleavage, NADH and FADH 2 are also produced. The acetyl CoA may then enter the citric acid cycle while the NADH and FADH 2 may also be used to produce ATP. The fatty acids that are used for beta-oxidation yields more ATP per carbon than carbohydrates.",

      "concept_text": "Recall that the mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles found in eukaryotic cells and are responsible for the production of ATP. For this question, it is important to understand that mitochondria possess their own DNA, separate from that of the nucleus. All mitochondrial DNA is maternal because all mitochondria are inherited from the mother. During fertilization, the sperm (male gamete) only contributes the nucleus that contains genetic material, while all other cellular organelles come from the egg (female gamete). Additionally, post-fertilization, the zygote will undergo a process by which the paternal mitochondria will be eliminated. This leaves only the maternal mitochondria present in the developing embryo.  This means all mitochondria – and by extension, all mitochondrial DNA – are maternally inherited. Since mitochondria only contains maternal DNA and therefore is a suitable DNA source for this study, therefore, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Nucleus – This option is incorrect because the nucleus stores a combination of both maternal and paternal DNA. Recall that the nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle found in eukaryotic cells that stores its genome. The genome of a cell is the result of fertilization between the father’s sperm cell and the mother’s egg cell, so while this answer choice may be tempting because it is an organelle that contains DNA, it is not an organelle that contains only maternal DNA. Option C. Ribosome – This option is incorrect because ribosomes do not possess any DNA. Recall that ribosomes are non-membrane bound organelles that are responsible for the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into a protein. Option D. Cytoplasm – This option is incorrect because while mitochondria are technically found in the cytoplasm, DNA is not found in the cytoplasm itself. Recall that the cytoplasm includes the cytosol (jelly-like fluid that fills the interior of the cell) as well as the organelles within the cell. These organelles include peroxisomes, lysosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, the Golgi, etc. Option E. Endoplasmic reticulum – This option is incorrect because the endoplasmic reticulum does not possess any DNA. Recall that the endoplasmic reticulum is made up of both the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER) and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER). The rough ER is studded with ribosomes and functions to synthesize proteins. The smooth ER, on the other hand, is not studded with ribosomes and instead functions to synthesize lipids and steroid hormones for export.",

      "concept_text": "Some questions you may encounter in the biology section are “ application ” style questions – these questions are not testing your knowledge of a specific fact, but instead your ability to apply what you know and interpret information presented to you. Answering this question does not rely on having specifically memorized the correct answer, but instead being able to systematically eliminate each incorrect answer choice to arrive at the correct conclusion. As we go through the process of elimination for each option (refer to the “Process of Elimination” section below), we can conclude that only Option C can be correct. Option C states that “plants are best adapted to the depth they are present in”. This is a fairly generic and safe biological statement and the information presented in the image does not contradict it. Generally speaking, most species of organisms are best adapted to the environment they are found, which is consistent with natural selection favoring traits and adaptations for specific habitats.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Less complex species are found at deeper depth – This option is incorrect because it is difficult to determine from the information given in the image alone which species are more ‘complex’ and some species appear at multiple different depths. Seagrass, for example, is found in both Zone 1 and Zone 4. (Zone 1 has the lowest depth, while Zone 4 has the highest depth.) From this, we can know that less complex species are not necessarily always found at deeper depths – and that there is insufficient information to conclude there is any relationship between complexity and depth. Option B. There is more ecological succession at shallower depth – This option is incorrect because the diagram does not provide us with sufficient information to determine ecological succession. Ecological succession is a process during which the composition of species in a community changes over time – for example, an area of land starting with barren rock, eventually developing lichens, then grass, and eventually a full forest with trees. The information presented in the image does not allow for any conclusions about the amount of ecological succession occurring, or even if it is occurring at all – notice that some species appear at both very shallow and very deep depths (e.g. seagrass). Therefore, we cannot reasonably conclude anything about the ecological succession occurring from the image, as there is not a consistent progression in species composition with changing depth. Option D. Plants can survive in only a single niche – This option is incorrect because while there are plants that can survive in only a single niche, some plants are capable of surviving in multiple niches. For example, seagrass can be found in both Zone 1 and Zone 4, which differ greatly in depth. We can also observe that sea lettuce can be found in both Zone 1 and Zone 2. Option E. There is an increasing number of species at deeper depths – This option is incorrect because the number of species does not increase as we go deeper into the ecosystem. In the given diagram, Zone 1 has the shallowest depth, followed by Zone 2 and 3, with Zone 4 being the deepest. We can observe two species in Zone 1, one species in Zone 2, two species in Zone 3, and two species in Zone 4. Hence, based on the diagram, there is no correlation between depth and the number of species present in that habitat.",
