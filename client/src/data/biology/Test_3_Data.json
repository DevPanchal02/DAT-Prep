      "concept_text": "Nucleic acids are present in both viruses and E. coli bacteria. Viruses contain nucleic acids such as RNA or DNA that can be single-stranded or double-stranded and a capsid composed of proteins enclosing the nucleic acid. In addition, some viruses contain spike proteins – usually made of glycoproteins – on their viral envelope. Recall that viruses lack independent metabolism and therefore, are not considered living organisms. They also lack any form of organelle found in other living organisms. Bacteria, on the other hand, do possess an independent metabolism, along with a single, circular, double-stranded DNA molecule, ribosomes, flagella, and a cell wall. Bacteria, as opposed to viruses, are considered living organisms and therefore, have more complex anatomy than viruses do. Since nucleic acids are found in both a virus and E. coli bacteria, Option B , Nucleic Acids , is the correct answer. For a virus, the genetic code within the nucleic acid is crucial as it provides the instructions needed to manipulate a host cell. For an E. coli bacterium, just like all other living organisms, nucleic acids are vital because they provide the genetic blueprints for building and operating the cell. Some characteristics of bacteria and viruses are visualized in the images below. CC BY 4.0 CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Organelles – This option is incorrect because viruses lack organelles. Organelles are specialized structures within a living cell; however, viruses are not truly living organisms because they lack many defining characteristics of life such as an independent metabolism and cellular structure. Viruses are parasitic; they rely on a host cell to carry out the cellular functions needed for the virus to keep spreading (such as replication of genetic material). This is how viruses can continue spreading despite their lack of independent cellular machinery (such as organelles). Option C. Capsids – This option is incorrect. Capsids are protein coats that surround the DNA or RNA of a virus. Recall that viruses do not possess a cell wall or a plasma membrane. Capsids serve to protect the viral genetic material and assist in the attachment of a virus onto host cells. Capsids are exclusively a structure of viruses and are not present in bacteria. Therefore, this answer option is incorrect. Option D. Cell Wall – This option is incorrect. While bacteria do contain a cell wall composed of peptidoglycan, viruses do not have a cell wall. Instead, viruses contain a capsid that surrounds the DNA or RNA of a virus. Some, but not all, viruses also possess a viral envelope that surrounds the capsid. Option E. Spike proteins – This option is incorrect. Spike proteins are projections on the surface of viruses (made up of glycoproteins) that facilitate the infiltration of the virus into a host cell. Spike proteins are exclusive to viruses and are not found in bacteria, which makes this answer option incorrect. However, keep in mind that not all viruses possess spike proteins; a few notable examples of viruses that do have spike proteins are coronaviruses, influenza, and HIV.",

      "concept_text": "Early Earth did not contain free oxygen (O 2 ) in the atmosphere and therefore, the organisms that existed on Earth were primarily anaerobic archaea and anaerobic bacteria . Around 2.5 billion years ago, oxygen levels began to rise on Earth due to the presence of photosynthetic bacteria known as cyanobacteria . O 2 production by cyanobacteria remained low for millions of years but eventually reached a tipping point and caused a massive increase in the levels of O 2 in the atmosphere; this event is known as the Great Oxidation Event. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are photosynthetic organisms that use photons from the sun to make their own energy/food. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O) are converted into glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) and oxygen (O 2 ) with the help of photons from sunlight. As we can see, atmospheric oxygen is one of the products of photosynthesis. During the Great Oxidation Event, cyanobacteria were performing photosynthesis which led to the increase in oxygen levels on Earth. This increase in oxygen levels led to the introduction of aerobic eukaryotic organisms. This accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere eventually led to the formation of the ozone layer , further influencing the Earth’s early atmosphere. Because cyanobacteria were responsible for first producing oxygen on Earth, Option B is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Protozoa – This option is incorrect. Protozoa are the name given to animal-like protists. Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotic organisms. Protozoa are heterotrophic and are often parasitic. Protozoa are heterotrophs, not photosynthetic autotrophs so they are unable to produce oxygen. Option C. Fungi – This option is incorrect because fungi are heterotrophs, not photosynthetic autotrophs, and therefore, are unable to produce oxygen. Fungi are eukaryotic heterotrophs that feed on dead matter. Fungi contain a cell wall made of chitin. Fungi can alternate between haploid and diploid stages, although the haploid stage predominates. Fungi are also capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. Fungi can either be classified as filamentous or non-filamentous. Option D. Platyhelminthes – This option is incorrect because Platyhelminthes are heterotrophic and therefore do not perform photosynthesis. In other words, their metabolism does not produce oxygen. Platyhelminthes is a phylum within the kingdom Animalia. Platyhelminthes are characterized as triploblastic acoelomates, can reproduce sexually or asexually, and are mainly found in aquatic habitats. Examples of Platyhelminthes include flatworms, trematodes, flukes, tapeworms, and planarians. Interestingly, Platyhelminthes possess a remarkable regenerative ability due to the presence of neoblasts. Neoblasts are a type of undifferentiated stem cell that can differentiate into any cell type within the body. This allows Platyhelminthes to regenerate lost body parts and even survive being cut in half, a feat not seen in most animal groups. Option E. Slime molds – This option is incorrect. Slime molds are fungus-like protists. Slime molds feed on dead matter and form filaments like fungi do. Slime molds, in contrast to true fungi, are capable of locomotion. Slime molds are heterotrophic and therefore do not perform photosynthesis which produces oxygen.",

      "concept_text": "When we consume more calories than we burn (energy surplus), our bodies store the excess energy as adipose tissue . Conversely, when we burn more calories than we consume (energy deficit), our bodies tap into stored fat reserves for fuel, leading to weight loss. During a prolonged state of calorie deficit, the body breaks down fat storage to release fatty acids and glycerol via a process called lipolysis . These fatty acids are then transported to the mitochondria of various cells to contribute to cellular respiration for the production of ATP. The law of conservation of mass tells us that these fatty acids do not just disappear. The combustion of adipose tissue, like any combustion process, eventually produces the byproducts CO 2 (carbon dioxide) and H 2 O (water). When the body breaks down fat stores for energy, the carbon atoms in fatty acids combine with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water through the process of fatty acid oxidation. The water is either excreted through urine, sweat, or other bodily fluids, while the carbon dioxide is primarily exhaled through the lungs . In the process of weight loss, the majority is exhaled in the form of carbon dioxide. Therefore, Option B , Exhalation in the form of CO 2 is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Inhalation of lipolytic enzymes – This option is incorrect . While lipolytic enzymes do contribute to the breakdown of fat, they are not inhaled, as this option suggests. Moreover, lipolytic enzymes only contribute to the breakdown of lipid molecules (i.e. lipolysis). The products of lipolysis (fatty acids and glycerol) are still present in the body and must be metabolized. Lipolytic enzymes do not contribute to the ultimate removal of fat mass from the body, making this answer option incorrect. Option C. Combustion of amino acids into proteins – This option is incorrect because amino acids are never \"combusted\" into proteins. In fact, amino acids are the monomer form of proteins – this means that proteins would be broken down into amino acids, not vice versa. Additionally, while proteins may sometimes be involved in weight loss (extreme calorie deficit may trigger muscle breakdown) this does not make up the majority of weight loss. Instead, the majority of weight is lost in the form of exhaled CO 2 (byproduct of fat metabolism). Option D. Excreted in the form of O 2 – This option is incorrect because O 2 is not excreted during fat breakdown or cellular respiration. First, recall that excretion is the process by which metabolic waste is eliminated from an organism. While oxygen is involved in fat loss by serving as the final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain of cellular respiration, those oxygen molecules bond with two hydrogen atoms to form water (H 2 O). Therefore, the oxygen atoms that are involved in cellular respiration come out of the biochemical pathway as H 2 O and not O 2 . Additionally, while a portion of weight loss is achieved through water loss (such as sweat or urine), the majority of weight loss is achieved through the exhalation of CO 2 . Option E. Conversion of fat cells to skeletal muscle tissue – This option is incorrect because fat cells cannot be converted to muscle cells – no biochemical pathway allows for this conversion to occur. Adipocytes (fat cells) and myocytes (muscle cells) have vastly different structures optimized for distinct functions. Fat cells are primarily for storing lipids, while muscle cells are packed with contractile proteins for movement. If an individual loses fat while also gaining muscle mass, it is actually two separate processes occurring simultaneously (fat loss and muscle growth) — it is NOT the conversion of fat cells to muscle cells and therefore, this answer option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "Hormones play a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes in the body such as development, growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Estrogen is a steroid hormone. All steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol and have a 4-ring structure. Sex hormones (a type of steroid hormone) are primarily produced in the ovaries (females) and testes (males). Because cholesterol is lipid-soluble, all steroid hormones are also lipid-soluble (or hydrophobic) , and therefore, estrogen can freely diffuse through the cell membrane and bind to estrogen receptors inside the cell – located either in the nucleus or in the cytosol. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer. After a steroid hormone (such as estrogen) binds to its corresponding intracellular steroid receptor, a hormone-receptor complex is formed. This complex is then able to induce changes in the cell by binding to the promoter region of certain genes, thus altering the gene expression of that cell. Note that steroid hormones directly induce changes to their target cells and do not rely on secondary messengers to induce intracellular changes. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Estrogen binds to a lipid raft to enter the cell – This option is incorrect because estrogen does not bind to lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are portions of a cell’s membrane that have a high concentration of cholesterol and sphingolipids. The primary function of lipid rafts is to regulate the structure and fluidity of the cell membrane. Although estrogen is derived from cholesterol, and there are high levels of cholesterol molecules in lipid rafts, the function of a lipid raft is not to carry estrogen molecules through the cell membrane. Rather, cholesterol helps maintain the cell membrane’s fluidity in low temperatures and helps maintain the cell membrane’s rigidity in high temperatures. Option C . Estrogen binds to a transmembrane receptor to affect cell activity – This option is incorrect because estrogen does not bind to transmembrane receptors. Rather, all steroid hormones, including estrogen, can freely diffuse through the cell membrane and bind to receptors inside the cell. This ability of lipid-soluble steroid hormones to freely diffuse into the cytosol is thanks to the cell membrane’s fatty acid tails. As a steroid hormone, estrogen binds to intracellular receptors – not transmembrane receptors. Instead, transmembrane receptors are present in the pathways of peptide hormones (such as LH, FSH, or ACTH); their hydrophilicity prevents them from crossing the cell membrane and they rely on transmembrane receptors to relay a signal transduction cascade within the cell via secondary messengers. Option D. Estrogen activates the secondary messenger IP3 to stimulate estrogenic activity – This option is incorrect. IP3 (inositol trisphosphate) is a secondary messenger; when the correct molecule binds to an IP3 receptor, it triggers the release of stored calcium ions into the cytoplasm, which then initiates various intracellular responses. However, estrogen does not interact with or depend on secondary messengers. Since estrogen can freely diffuse through the membrane (because it is lipid-soluble) and directly induce its effects on the cell, there is no need to interact with any secondary messenger, making this answer option incorrect. Instead, secondary messengers are present in the pathways of peptide hormones (such as LH, FSH, or ACTH); their hydrophilicity prevents them from crossing the cell membrane and they rely on transmembrane receptors to relay a signal transduction cascade within the cell via secondary messengers. Option E . Estrogen utilizes the cAMP pathway to develop secondary sex characteristics – This option is incorrect. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a secondary messenger; when the correct molecule binds to a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) it activates an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP into cAMP, which then goes on to induce various intracellular pathways. However, estrogen does not interact with or depend on secondary messengers. Since estrogen can freely diffuse through the membrane (because it is lipid-soluble) and directly induce its effects on the cell, there is no need to interact with any secondary messenger, making this answer option incorrect.

These chromosomes are stored inside the nucleus of the cell. The DNA within chromosomes is wrapped around proteins known as histones to form more condensed chromatin. Recall that DNA itself is a polymer made from its monomeric subunits known as nucleotides . Four nitrogenous bases are present in DNA: guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine. In each DNA strand, the nucleotides are linked to each other via phosphodiester bonds, and the two strands are held together via hydrogen bonds. Each chromosome has coding regions, known as genes , that code for proteins that give an organism its traits. Each gene is composed of a sequence of nucleotides; the quantity of nucleotides within a gene varies vastly between genes. These genes are inheritable and determine the characteristics of an organism. Looking at the question, we need to rank the components from smallest to largest. Recall that chromosomes are stored within the nucleus of the cell. This means that the nucleus is the largest structure on the list. Chromosomes are the second largest structure on the list. Recall that chromosomes are a polymer of nucleotides. The only nucleotide offered on the list is cytosine, so cytosine is the smallest component. Genes are segments of DNA that code for proteins. There are many genes on a chromosome, therefore, genes are smaller than a chromosome but larger than a nucleotide.

      "concept_text": "One of the many ways eukaryotic gene expression is regulated is by adjusting how tightly DNA is wrapped around histone proteins; this changes the amount of DNA that is available for RNA polymerase to attach to. Most eukaryotes have a vast genome that needs to be efficiently and tightly packed to fit the nucleus. This is achieved by wrapping DNA around protein complexes known as histones . These positively charged protein complexes interact with negatively charged DNA to be held in place together. The structure of DNA wrapped around histones is known as chromatin and it is extremely useful in gene expression because highly condensed DNA strands (tightly wrapped around histone proteins) cannot be accessed by RNA polymerase molecules, and thus cannot be transcribed into mRNA. Similarly, if a DNA strand is not condensed (i.e. if it is loosely wrapped around histone), RNA polymerase molecules can more easily access the chromatin and begin transcription. Euchromatin is the term for less condensed regions of chromatin with active genes that are readily accessible for transcription. In contrast, heterochromatin describes the highly condensed regions (generally transcriptionally inactive) which results in low rates of gene expression. In the scenario put forth by this question, an enzyme destroys the histone proteins of a cell. This would hinder the cell’s ability to tightly pack DNA around histone protein complexes. As a result, most of the cell’s genome would be unwrapped and available for RNA polymerase to transcribe. Therefore, Option C , RNA polymerase will have better access to the chromatin , is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Gene expression would significantly decrease – This option is incorrect because gene expression would actually increase in this scenario. If a cell’s histone proteins were destroyed, then the cell’s genome would remain intact, but would not be able to be tightly packed into heterochromatin. Rather, this scenario would result in most of the genome becoming loose and available for transcription. In other words, gene expression would increase – not decrease. Option B. The cell membrane would no longer be semi-permeable – This option is incorrect because the permeability of the cell’s membrane is irrelevant to the packing of DNA into chromatin. Remember, chromatin is only present in eukaryotes, which possess compartmentalization. Given that DNA is stored in the nucleus of a eukaryote, a cell’s ability to tightly wrap its DNA is unlikely to have a direct impact on the permeability of the cell’s membrane. Option D. The genome within the nucleus would become shorter – This option is incorrect because the length of the genome would not be affected. If an enzyme destroys the histone proteins of a cell, it will affect gene expression – it would not make the genome shorter, as the nucleotides themselves are unaffected by histone protein deletion. Spatially, the genome would “unravel” as a result of no longer being as compact, and would appear longer. Option E. The chromatin would become highly condensed – This option is incorrect because this is the opposite of what would occur if a cell’s histone proteins were destroyed. Recall that chromatin is formed when DNA wraps around histone proteins. “Highly condensed” chromatin occurs when DNA is very tightly wrapped around histone protein complexes. If a cell’s histone protein were destroyed, the cell’s genome would be very loose and uncondensed – not highly condensed, as this option suggests. This would subsequently increase the accessibility of the genome to RNA polymerase, increasing gene expression.",

      "concept_text": "E. coli are facultative anaerobes. That is, when oxygen is present, E. coli will undergo aerobic respiration to produce ATP. But if oxygen is absent, E. coli will have to produce ATP anaerobically via glycolysis and fermentation . Recall that during aerobic respiration, oxygen is the final electron acceptor. Glycolysis is the first step of aerobic cellular respiration. During glycolysis, a glucose molecule is broken down into two pyruvate molecules. During the process, two NAD + are reduced into NADH. In addition, a net of two ATP is produced. The final yield resulting from glycolysis with the use of one glucose molecule is two pyruvate , two NADH , and two ATP . It is very important to remember that glycolysis can only proceed if NAD + is present. It turns out that NAD + is also required for the next two steps of aerobic respiration to proceed: pyruvate decarboxylation and the Krebs cycle, respectively. NAD + gets regenerated during the final step of aerobic respiration, known as oxidative phosphorylation. We do not need to get deep into the details of oxidative phosphorylation for this solution; just know that NADH and FADH 2 are oxidized into NAD + and FAD. This is how NAD + gets regenerated so it can be used again during pyruvate decarboxylation and the Krebs cycle. However, oxygen is the final electron acceptor during oxidative phosphorylation, so oxidative phosphorylation can only proceed if oxygen is available. This is why oxidative phosphorylation directly relies on oxygen and pyruvate decarboxylation and Krebs cycle indirectly rely on oxygen. So, if NAD + is required for glycolysis to proceed but all the NAD+ is being converted to NADH, where does glycolysis get a fresh supply of NAD+ from? The answer to that question is fermentation. Fermentation is a completely anaerobic process and resupplies glycolysis with NAD + so glycolysis can continue to produce ATP in the absence of oxygen. There are two types of fermentation that you need to know for your test: lactic acid fermentation and alcohol fermentation. E. coli can undergo lactic acid fermentation whereby the pyruvate that’s produced from glycolysis will not undergo the pyruvate decarboxylation step, but instead, will enter the fermentation pathway. From here, the pyruvate will be converted into lactic acid while NADH is oxidized into NAD + . This NAD + can be used to continue glycolysis. An image outlining lactic acid fermentation can be found below. In the absence of oxygen, E. coli will undergo glycolysis and fermentation to continue production of ATP, therefore, Option D . is the correct answer to this question. It is important to note that glycolysis and fermentation are different from anaerobic respiration . Anaerobic respiration is similar to aerobic respiration, however, instead of oxygen, a different molecule is used as the final electron acceptor. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Gl ycolysis only – This option is incorrect . While glycolysis is an anaerobic process, glycolysis still requires a supply of NAD + to proceed. In the absence of oxygen, oxidative phosphorylation is not able to proceed and replenish NAD + . Glycolysis itself is not able to independently replenish NAD + which is why fermentation needs to be paired with glycolysis in completely anaerobic conditions. Option B. Fermentation only – This option is incorrect . The purpose of fermentation is to replenish NAD + when oxygen is not present. Fermentation alone does not produce ATP. The NAD + that is replenished from fermentation is used during glycolysis to produce ATP. For this reason, under anaerobic conditions, E. coli will use both fermentation and glycolysis together. Option C . Krebs cycle only – This option is incorrect . The Krebs cycle indirectly relies on oxygen. Recall that the Krebs cycle needs NAD + to proceed and NAD + is replenished via oxidative phosphorylation (the NAD + produced from fermentation is not used during the Krebs cycle). When oxygen is absent, oxidative phosphorylation cannot proceed and NAD + is not regenerated for use during pyruvate decarboxylation or the Krebs cycle. For this reason, when oxygen is absent, the Krebs cycle cannot proceed. Option E. Glycolysis and Krebs cycle – This option is incorrect . Under anaerobic conditions, glycolysis and fermentation will proceed, however, the Krebs cycle does not proceed. Because the Krebs cycle part of this answer option is incorrect, this answer option as a whole is incorrect. The NAD + produced from fermentation is not used for the Krebs cycle, but rather, it is used for glycolysis.",

      "concept_text": "For your test, it is important to understand the life cycle of a cell, known as the cell cycle . The cell cycle is broken down into 2 main stages: Interphase and M phase (mitosis/meiosis). The cell spends the vast majority of its time in interphase. Interphase is the stage of the cell cycle where the cell is not dividing but preparing for cellular division. During the cell cycle, there are important checkpoints that ensure the cell cycle is operating as planned. Two of these important checkpoints occur during interphase. As seen in the image below, interphase can be further broken down into Gap Phase 1 (G 1 ), Synthesis Phase (S), and Gap Phase 2 (G 2 ). Let’s take a brief look at each of these stages. During Gap Phase 1 (G 1 ) , the cell increases in size and initiates protein synthesis in preparation for cell division. The first important cell cycle checkpoint occurs at the end of G 1 . This checkpoint ensures that everything is ready for DNA synthesis, which occurs in the next phase (S phase). If the G 1 checkpoint decides that conditions are unfavorable for DNA synthesis, the cell will enter G 0 . If cells pass the G 1 checkpoint, they will enter the Synthesis Phase (S phase) . During the S phase, the cell will replicate its genome and centrosomes in preparation for a cellular division event. All DNA replication occurs during the S phase, forming the chromatids. After the S phase is complete, cells move on to Gap Phase 2 (G 2 ). Gap Phase 2 (G 2 ) is the final preparation before mitosis. During G 2 , rapid cellular growth occurs, organelles are replicated, proteins continue to be synthesized, and genetic material is prepared for cell division. The second cell cycle checkpoint occurs during G 2 as well. During this checkpoint, the cell checks for checks that everything is ready for mitosis to proceed (e.g. chromatids properly duplicated). So long as the cell passes the G 2 checkpoint, the cell will continue to M Phase. M phase is also broken down into multiple sub-phases, however, for the purposes of this question, we do not need to discuss the details of these sub-phases. M Phase stands for mitosis or meiosis, which are both important cellular division processes that you should understand in detail for your test. If you do not fully understand all stages of mitosis and meiosis, it is highly suggested that you return to the bio notes and study these processes in full. Since DNA is replicated during the Synthesis Phase (S Phase) of interphase, Option A is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. G 0 phase – This option is incorrect because DNA replication does not occur during G 0 phase. G 0 is a resting phase that a cell enters if it is not actively dividing. One reason a cell might enter this phase is if it does not pass the Gap Phase 1 (G 1 ) checkpoint. Other cells that are in the G 0 phase are still alive and perfectly functional – they are just not actively dividing or preparing to divide. Not all cells are constantly dividing; some somatic cells permanently enter G 0 phase after a certain age (e.g. muscle or nerve cells). Option C. G 1 phase – This option is incorrect because DNA replication does not occur during G 1 phase. During Gap Phase 1 (G 1 ), the cell will physically grow in size and many proteins will be synthesized. One of the important cell cycle checkpoints also occurs at the end of G 1 phase. DNA replication does not occur during G 1 phase. Option D. G 2 phase – This option is incorrect DNA replication does not occur during G 2 phase. During Gap Phase 2 (G 2 ), rapid cell growth occurs, and organelles are replicated. The cell will also check the accuracy of DNA replication and whether everything is ready for mitosis to proceed (e.g. whether chromatids are properly duplicated). DNA replication does not occur during G 2 phase, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option E. M phase – This option is incorrect because this phase is where cell division takes place. M Phase stands for either mitosis or meiosis. DNA replication does not occur in either mitosis or meiosis; rather, all of the cell's DNA is duplicated during the S phase of Interphase, which occurs before the M phase.",

Ribosome is the correct answer to this question.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Mitochondria – This option is incorrect. Recall that one of the defining characteristics of prokaryotes is that they lack membrane-bound organelles. The mitochondria are double-membraned organelles responsible for the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through the process of cellular respiration. Therefore, prokaryotes do not possess mitochondria, which makes this answer option incorrect. The inner membrane of mitochondria is highly folded into structures called cristae, which increase the surface area for cellular respiration to take place. Within mitochondria, the Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle, occurs in the matrix (compartment enclosed by the inner membrane), producing high-energy molecules like NADH and FADH2. These molecules then participate in the electron transport chain (ETC), located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where ATP is generated through oxidative phosphorylation. Option B. Endoplasmic reticulum – This option is incorrect. The endoplasmic reticulum is broken down into two subtypes: the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER) and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER). The smooth ER lacks ribosomes on its surface and is involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification, whereas the rough ER has ribosomes embedded in its outer surface and primarily contributes to protein synthesis. Despite their distinct functions, both the smooth and rough ER are considered membrane-bound organelles. Recall that prokaryotes lack membrane-bound organelles, therefore, this answer option is incorrect. Option C. Lysosome – This option is incorrect. The lysosome is a membrane-bound organelle that contains digestive enzymes with low pH, functions in apoptosis, and breaks down nutrients, bacteria, and cell debris. Lysosomes also help break down any foreign pathogens that were engulfed by phagocytic white blood cells. Because prokaryotes lack membrane-bound organelles, prokaryotes do not possess a lysosome. Option D. Nucleus – This option is incorrect . The nucleus houses the genetic material of the cell and is the site of DNA replication and transcription. The nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle. Since prokaryotes lack membrane-bound organelles, prokaryotes do not possess a nucleus.

      "concept_text": "To answer this question, we must first understand some details about the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is a unique endoplasmic reticulum found in muscle fibers. We notice in the question that we are specifically asked about striated muscle cells. Recall that the striations found in striated muscle are a result of sarcomeres , which are the functional unit of striated muscle. Striated muscles contract via the sliding filament model , whereby actin and myosin filaments slide past one another. The sliding of myofilaments shortens the sarcomere and stimulates muscular contraction! Let’s briefly look at the sequence of events that lead to muscle contraction. For muscle contraction to occur, a presynaptic motor neuron must first deliver its action potential to the postsynaptic muscle fiber. To do this, the presynaptic motor neuron will synapse with the postsynaptic muscle fiber and release acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular junction is the space between the neuromuscular motor neuron and the postsynaptic muscle fiber. This acetylcholine will bind to receptors on the muscle fiber which lead to sodium channels on the muscle fiber opening. This leads to an influx of sodium ions which will depolarize the cell and lead to the firing of an action potential. Once the action potential has been initiated, the action potential will travel along the T-tubules until it meets the sarcoplasmic reticulum. As the depolarization reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum, it will lead to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels. This calcium will be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and will bind to troponin, causing troponin to remove tropomyosin from the binding site on actin. Once the binding sites on actin are exposed, the myosin heads can bind to the actin and pull it toward the center of the sarcomere, stimulating muscle contraction! Because the sarcoplasmic reticulum is responsible for the storage and secretion of calcium ions, Option B is the correct answer to this question. CC BY 4.0",

Sodium ions – This option is incorrect because the sarcoplasmic reticulum is essentially a smooth endoplasmic reticulum found within muscle cells. Once opened, it releases calcium ions – not sodium ions – to initiate muscle contraction. While sodium ions are responsible for the depolarization of the muscle cell, sodium ions are NOT stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Option D. Acetylcholine – This option is incorrect because acetylcholine never enters the muscle cell, nor is it an ion. Instead, acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that functions as a signaling molecule and only interacts with receptors on the surface of the muscle cell membrane. Since the sarcoplasmic reticulum resides inside muscle cells, and acetylcholine never enters the cells, it cannot be stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which makes this answer option incorrect. Acetylcholine is stored in synaptic vesicles within the motor neuron. Option E. Potassium ions – This option is incorrect because the sarcoplasmic reticulum is essentially a smooth endoplasmic reticulum found within muscle cells. Once opened, it releases calcium ions – not potassium ions – to initiate muscle contraction. Although potassium ions are important in muscle contraction, they are not stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as this option suggests.

Cilia and flagella are very similar structures. In general, prokaryotic flagella are made from flagellin while eukaryotic flagella are made from tubulin. Flagella are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and are primarily involved in locomotion. Cilia are also involved in cellular locomotion, however, only cilia – not flagella – are found in the respiratory tract. The function of cilia is to sweep unwanted debris away. Option C. Microvilli – This option is incorrect because microvilli are hair-like projections found on enterocytes (cells found in the small and large intestine) — not in the lungs. Microvilli help to increase the surface area of the intestines which then increases the absorption of nutrients. The greater the surface area that is exposed to the food, the greater the absorption of nutrients. The actin core of microvilli provides structural support to the hair-like projections.

      "concept_text": "The chart in question depicts a physiological process known as an action potential. Action potentials are ‘all or nothing events’ that transmit nerve signals to target neurons/tissues. An action potential is the result of changes to the membrane potential of a neuron due to the movement of certain ions across the membrane of that neuron. The typical resting membrane potential of a neuron is -70mV. Because this potential is not neutral (it is less than 0), the resting membrane potential is said to be polarized. Once the neuron receives a stimulus, it causes gated ion channels to open resulting in an influx of Na + ions. This influx of positively charged ions increases the membrane potential of the neuron, a process known as depolarization . If the stimulus is strong enough, the membrane potential will reach the threshold value (-55mV) and an action potential will fire, causing the signal to travel down the neuron. When an action potential fires, voltage-gated Na + channels open (K + channels do not open yet) along the entire length of the neuron leading to a large influx of Na + ions. This leads to the membrane potential reaching a max value of ~30mV. Once the max value is reached, Na+ channels become inactivated while K + ion channels open to allow for the efflux of K + ions. This efflux of K + restores polarization (repolarization) of the neuron, however, too much K + is released and the membrane potential stoops lower than -70mV, a process known as hyperpolarization . This period is brief and eventually, resting membrane potential is restored (−70 mV). While an action is in progress, there are periods where a new action potential is either impossible to initiate or a stronger-than-usual stimulus is required. Collectively, these periods are known as the refractory periods . There are two different kinds of refractory periods: the absolute refractory period and the relative refractory period. Absolute refractory period is the time period in which a second action potential ABSOLUTELY cannot be initiated, no matter how large the applied stimulus is. The absolute refractory period is a result of inactive Na + channels. The absolute refractory period sets the upper limit for the frequency of action potentials. The absolute refractory period begins once the threshold potential is met and ends after repolarization (just before hyperpolarization begins). Relative refractory period is the time period immediately following the Absolute Refractory Period during which the initiation of a second action potential is possible, but a stronger-than-usual stimulus is required. The relative refractory period occurs when the membrane potential of the neuron is hyperpolarized (more negative than resting membrane potential). If the membrane potential of the neuron is more negative than the resting membrane potential, a stronger stimulus is required for the membrane potential to reach the threshold value and fire another action potential. During the relative refractory period, the voltage-gated Na + channels are no longer inactivated. In the image in question, the arrow is pointing to the beginning of depolarization. During this time, Na + channels are open to allow for the influx of NA + while K + channels are closed to prevent the efflux of K + . For this reason, Option A is the correct answer to this question.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Na + channels are closed, K + channels are opened – This option is incorrect . Recall that repolarization occurs when Na + channels close and K + channels open to allow for the efflux of positively charged potassium ions. The exiting of these positively charged potassium ions from the cell allows for the membrane potential to become more negative and return to resting membrane potential (-70mV). Because the arrow is pointing to the beginning of depolarization, not repolarization, this option is incorrect. Option C. Na + channels are closed, K + channels are closed – This option is incorrect . During depolarization, Na + channels are open to allow for the influx of Na + ions while K + channels are closed to prevent the efflux of K + ions. Since the arrow is pointing to the beginning of depolarization, we know that Na+ channels are open, therefore, this option is incorrect. It is only during the resting state (about -70 mV) that both voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels are closed. Option D. Na + channels are opened, K + channels are opened – This option is incorrect . During depolarization, Na + channels are open to allow for the influx of Na+ ions while K + channels are closed to prevent the efflux of K + ions.

      "concept_text": "The circulatory system is a vast network of vessels responsible for transporting blood throughout the body. The primary role of the circulatory system is to deliver oxygen (O 2 ) and nutrients to cells and tissue for them to carry out their intended function, while also removing waste products like carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). In broad terms, the circulatory system is divided into arterial and venous vessels. Arterial vessels carry blood away from the heart, whereas venous vessels carry blood toward the heart. A useful mnemonic is A rtery = A way. Although it is common to visualize blood vessels with thick a diameter when picturing the circulatory system (e.g. veins in forearm used to draw blood), the smaller-sized vessels are just as important for the delivery O 2 and disposal of CO 2 . As seen in the image below, both arterial and venous vessels branch out to smaller vessels, which then branch out to even smaller vessels – similar to the road system of a city (highway → major roads → smaller roads → even smaller residential streets). As blood leaves the heart to deliver O 2 to the rest of the body, it follows this path: Aorta (largest vessel) → arteries → arterioles → capillaries → tissues get nutrients → venules → veins → superior and inferior vena cava → cycle repeats It’s important to remember that each load of blood that is pumped by the heart needs to be ejected with enough force to reach all tissues and organs of the body. Therefore, the blood vessels that receive the blood ejected from the heart first experience more pressure in comparison to those blood vessels that receive pumped blood farther away. As seen in the graph below, the greater the distance traveled from the heart, the lower the blood pressure. As a result, the largest blood vessel in the body, the aorta, is also the blood vessel that is subject to the highest blood pressure, which makes Option E , the correct answer. To accommodate for this great amount of force, the aorta is highly elastic.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Arteriole – This option is incorrect because arterioles are not the site of the highest blood pressure out of the given options. Arterioles branch out from arteries; the total cross-sectional area of the arterioles is much greater when compared to the arteries, which leads to a decrease in pressure. Additionally, arterioles are located far from the heart; therefore, blood pressure has already decreased by the time blood reaches the arterioles, due to distance from the heart. Option B. Vein – This option is incorrect because veins carry blood back towards the heart under significantly lower pressure than arteries, and much lower compared to the aorta. They have adapted to this with thinner walls and valves to prevent blood backflow. Option C. Vena Cava – This option is incorrect . Although the vena cava is the largest vein in the body, it still carries blood under relatively lower blood pressure due to being a vein. Recall that the aorta needs to withstand much higher blood pressure because it receives the entirety of each pump directly from the heart. In contrast, by the time blood reaches the two vena cava veins (superior and inferior), it has traveled the entire body and has lost much of the pressure originally being exerted on the aorta. The two vena cava veins are only much farther away from the heart but also split the influx of blood between the two (as opposed to the aorta carrying all of the heart's pumped blood). Option D. Capillaries – This option is incorrect because capillaries do not experience the highest pressure among all blood vessels. Capillaries form a vast network of extremely thin-walled vessels that allow for the exchange of gases (O 2 and CO 2 ) and nutrients with the cells of the body. As seen in the image above, capillaries experience less pressure compared to arteries and arterioles, therefore, this answer option is incorrect.",

The scenario in question made no mention of viruses, therefore, this option is incorrect. Option C. Conjugation – This option is incorrect . Conjugation is a horizontal gene transfer technique whereby a donor bacterium creates a bridge (pilus) that connects to a recipient bacterium. This pilus is used to transfer genetic material from the donor to the host. In the scenario in question, the E. coli and the H. pylori were never in the solution together at the same time. This would make conjugation impossible between the two bacteria. Option D. Transcription – This option is incorrect . DNA transcription is the conversion of DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA). After transcription has occurred, the mRNA that was produced can be used to create proteins via ribosomes during translation. The scenario in question did not describe transcription. Option E. Mutation – This option is incorrect . A mutation describes a change in the genetic material of an organism. Mutations may occur naturally via errors during DNA replication or unnaturally from exposure to certain conditions like radiation, chemicals, or certain viruses. The scenario in question describes transformation – not a mutation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. The main purpose of aldosterone is to increase blood pressure by acting on the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct of the nephron. Aldosterone increases sodium (Na+) reabsorption and has a minimal effect on potassium (K+) secretion. When sodium is reabsorbed into the circulation, water follows. This ultimately leads to an increase in blood volume and pressure! The question asks which structure in the body is the target of aldosterone and what the result of that interaction is. Aldosterone specifically targets the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the nephrons to induce sodium (Na + ) reabsorption and potassium (K+) secretion. The reabsorption of sodium creates an osmotic gradient that forces the water to be also reabsorbed and “follow” the sodium. In other words, the reabsorption of sodium creates a higher concentration of solutes in the kidney tissue compared to the tubule fluid, and water naturally moves toward the area of higher solute concentration to equalize the concentrations. Because of this, Option C. is the correct answer to the question.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Glomerulus; Decrease water reabsorption – This option is incorrect. The glomerulus is a cluster of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) located at the beginning of a nephron in the kidney. It acts as the initial filter for blood, allowing water and small solutes to pass through while retaining larger molecules like proteins and blood cells. Aldosterone does not target the glomerulus. Instead, aldosterone targets the collecting duct and distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, which makes this answer option incorrect. Aldosterone is responsible for increasing sodium and water reabsorption, as well as increasing potassium secretion in the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct. Aldosterone causes an increase – not a decrease – in water reabsorption. Option B. Proximal convoluted tubule; Increase water excretion – This option is incorrect because aldosterone induces water reabsorption – not excretion . Moreover, aldosterone does not target the proximal convoluted tubule. Instead, aldosterone targets the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct of the nephron. The proximal convoluted tubule is the segment between Bowman's capsule and the loop of Henle and is responsible for most of the reabsorption carried out by the nephron. Aldosterone is responsible for increasing sodium and water reabsorption, as well as increasing potassium secretion in the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct. If aldosterone levels were elevated, water would be reabsorbed from the filtrate into the circulation. This would lead to a decrease of water in the filtrate and therefore, a decrease in the amount of water being excreted. Option D. Ascending Loop of Henle; Lower blood pressure – This option is incorrect because aldosterone does not target either segment of the Loop of Henle (descending and ascending). Rather, aldosterone targets the collecting duct and distal convoluted tubule of the nephron. The ascending loop of Henle is impermeable to water and is the site of NaCl reabsorption. This answer option also incorrectly suggests that aldosterone lowers blood pressure; in reality, aldosterone increases blood pressure via the increase in reabsorption of sodium and water mostly at the proximal convoluted tubule. Option E. Collecting duct and Loop of Henle; Reabsorption of Ca 2+ – This option is incorrect for two reasons. First, aldosterone does not play a significant role in the regulation of calcium. Reabsorption of Ca 2+ in the kidneys is triggered by the parathyroid hormone (PTH) — not aldosterone. Additionally, aldosterone does not target the Loop of Henle. Rather, it targets the collecting duct and distal convoluted tubule of the . The collecting duct is the final segment of the nephron's tubule system. It is largely impermeable to water unless Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) acts on it. Aldosterone can also act on the collecting duct by increasing Na+ reabsorption, resulting in water passively following Na+.",

      "concept_text": "Meiosis and mitosis are two different cell division processes that share certain similarities and differences. Meiosis is the cellular division process by which a diploid parent cell will divide to form 4 haploid daughter cells (gametes). Recall that diploid cells contain two sets of chromosomes, whereas haploid cells contain only one set. Meiosis is a process that occurs in germ cells (sex cells). Mitosis is a cellular division process by which a diploid parent cell divides to form 2 diploid daughter cells that are genetically identical to each other, as well as the parent cell. Meiosis is broken down into 2 separate division events. These events are known as meiosis I and meiosis II. Mitosis only involves 1 cell division event. It is important that you understand all phases of meiosis and mitosis in depth for your test. For the sake of time and space of this solution, we will not be going over all stages of each cell division process. The crucial information that we need to understand for this question is that during meiosis I, each chromosome (consisting of two identical sister chromatids attached at a centromere) will synapse with their homologous pair to form a tetrad. The formation of these tetrads is crucial to maintaining genetic diversity among offspring; the formation of the tetrad is what allows for crossing over (recombination) to occur. That is, the homologous chromosomes exchange segments of DNA, which results in a truly unique combination of genetic information for every single gamete (every gamete has a distinct set of alleles). During anaphase I, these tetrads will separate, and each chromosome from the homologous pair will travel to opposite poles of the cell. During mitosis, homologous chromosomes do not pair/synapse with each other, and there is no crossing-over event. For this reason, Option E. is the correct answer to this question. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Separation of sister chromatids – This option is incorrect because the separation of sister chromatids occurs during the anaphase of mitosis and anaphase II of meiosis due to spindle fiber shortening. Spindle fibers are microtubule structures that attach to the centromere of each chromatid. During anaphase, the spindle fibers shorten, pulling the separated sister chromatids toward opposite poles of the cell. The separation of the sister chromatids marks the beginning of anaphase. Option B. Cytokinesis – This option is incorrect . Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division and is the physical separation of a parent cell into two daughter cells. This is achieved via the formation of the cleavage furrow, a contractile ring that forms in the later stages of animal cell division during cytokinesis. Using actin and myosin microfilaments, the ring contracts and pinches the cytoplasm into two separate daughter cells. Cytokinesis occurs once during mitosis and twice during meiosis. Option C. Condensing of chromosomes – This option is incorrect because this occurs during the prophase of mitosis and both prophase I and prophase II of meiosis. The condensing of chromosomes is a vital step of cell division in both mitosis and meiosis. Without condensation, the genetic material would become tangled or damaged as it is moved to the poles of the cell. Chromosome condensation ensures the safe and accurate movement of genetic material through the cytosol and thus ensures that each daughter cell receives the correct number of chromosomes. Moreover, chromosome condensation contributes to the regulation of gene expression during cell division because condensed chromosomes are generally less accessible to the cell’s gene expression machinery. Option D. Attachment of microtubules – This option is incorrect because proper attachment of microtubules is essential to pull genetic material apart (in both mitosis and meiosis). This is a highly regulated step and occurs during the metaphase of mitosis and both metaphase I and metaphase II of meiosis. During prophase, the mitotic spindle begins to form as two centrosomes (in animal cells) move apart. Each chromosome has two kinetochores, one on each sister chromatid. For accurate segregation, each kinetochore needs to attach to microtubules originating from opposite poles of the spindle. This arrangement ensures that when the spindle fibers shorten, the sister chromatids will be pulled apart towards opposite poles of the cell.",

In a phylogenetic tree, a node is any point along the tree where a population diverges into two or more distinct lineages. Remember that each node not only represents the point of divergence but also, the most common ancestor of all the lineages that came after said divergence. Additionally, a node located closer to the root of the tree represents a divergence that occurred further back in time, and by extension, an older common ancestor. Similarly, a node located farther from the root occurred more recently. The image above shows the phylogenetic tree of chordates. In this tree, the class Avia (more commonly referred to as birds) notably does not branch off of the main ancestral line. Most classes in this tree have no phylogenetic nodes separating them from the main ancestral line (that is, they branch off directly from the main ancestral line). However, Reptiles and Avia share a common ancestor that evolved after branching off of the main ancestral line. Therefore, Option C , Reptiles and Avia share a common ancestor , is the correct answer. It should be noted that, because reptiles and avia are separated by only one node, they are said to be evolutionary more closely related to each other than to any other class in the tree.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Only Avia have the ability to fly – This option is incorrect because phylogenetic trees are based on the evolutionary history of speciation (when a single ancestral species diverges into two or more distinct species); phylogenetic trees are not based on specific traits or abilities, such as flying. Nevertheless, Avia are not the only class with the ability to fly. For example: bats are members of the class Mammalia, yet they also fly. Option B. Avia were the first organism in the lineage – This option is incorrect because this statement is not true; multiple classes appeared before the class Avia. Specifically, Nonvertebrate Chordates, Fishes, and Amphibians appeared before Avia did. Remember, a node (branching point) located closer to the root of the tree represents a divergence that occurred further back in time, and by extension, an older common ancestor. Similarly, a node located farther from the root occurred more recently. Since there are multiple nodes in the lineage that occurred before the appearance of Avia, they are not the first organism in the lineage. Option D. Only warm-blooded animals connect to the main ancestral line – This option is incorrect because multiple cold-blooded classes connect to the main ancestral line; namely, Nonvertebrate Chordates, Fishes, and Amphibians are cold-blooded, yet they connect to the main ancestral line. Cold-blooded animals, such as amphibians, rely on external sources such as the sun to regulate their body temperature. In contrast, warm-blooded animals, such as mammals, can maintain a stable internal body temperature regardless of the external environment. They generate heat through metabolic processes and have mechanisms to cool down when needed, such as sweating or panting. Option E. Avia belong to their own independent Kingdom – This option is incorrect because Avia do not belong to their own independent kingdom. Recall that all eukaryotes fall into one of six kingdoms: Archaea, Bacteria, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia. The kingdom Animalia (animals) is further categorized into multiple phyla, one of which is the phylum Chordata (chordates). All taxonomic groups shown in the image above belong to the Kingdom Animalia and Phylum Chordata.",

      "concept_text": "Neurotransmitters are endogenous chemical messengers that are used to transmit chemical signals across the body. Multiple different neurotransmitters are used in different systems of the body. Neurotransmitters can also be excitatory or inhibitory. Excitatory neurotransmitters are neurotransmitters that lead to depolarization and increase the likelihood of an action potential. Inhibitory neurotransmitters, on the other hand, lead to hyperpolarization and decrease the likelihood of an action potential. Moreover, different neurotransmitters are used depending on whether the neurotransmitter is presynaptic or postsynaptic. This question asks which neurotransmitter is the most common in the neuromuscular junction of vertebrates. Of the given options, acetylcholine is the most common. Acetylcholine is released into the neuromuscular junction to transfer an action potential from a presynaptic motor neuron to a postsynaptic muscle fiber. Acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter, meaning when acetylcholine is released, it leads to a depolarization event on the postsynaptic muscle cell. This means that acetylcholine is used to induce muscular contraction. When acetylcholine is released into the neuromuscular junction, it facilitates the opening of ligand-gated Na + channels on the postsynaptic muscle fiber. This leads to the influx of Na + ions which causes the opening of voltage-gated Na + channels. Once the voltage-gated Na + channels have opened, it leads to the firing of an action potential! Because acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released into the neuromuscular junction of vertebrates, Option D is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",

      "concept_text": "Gastrulation is the formation of a trilaminar (three-layered) embryo; specifically, gastrulation results in the establishment of the three distinct germ layers : ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. After a blastula (hollow sphere of cells) is formed, cells on the surface of the blastula begin to invaginate (fold inward), forming a blastopore (opening). In protostomes, the blastopore becomes the mouth, whereas in deuterostomes, the blastopore becomes the anus. Gastrulation is a pivotal stage in the early development of most animal embryos because it establishes the basic body plan of the embryo and initiates interactions between cells from different germ layers. That is, gastrulation paves the way for signaling cascades between different parts of the embryo that guide the development and differentiation of tissues and organs. As such, Option D is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0 The interaction between different parts of the embryo is carried out via the process of induction. Via cell induction, cells influence the development of other adjacent cells by signaling a change in their gene expression. This occurs specifically during cell differentiation (i.e. stem cells becoming specialized). In other words, cell induction influences the fate of nearby cells. The change in gene expression leads to the translation of different proteins, which in turn leads to a different set of functions, which ultimately leads to differentiation into a specialized cell.",

Although gastrulation lays the foundation for the eventual formation of various organs by establishing the three germ layers, gastrulation does not directly result in the formation of organs. Organogenesis, the process of organ development, occurs later in embryonic development; therefore, this answer option is incorrect. Option B. Formation of the zygote – This option is incorrect because the zygote is formed much earlier, during fertilization, when a sperm cell fuses with an egg cell. After fertilization, the steps of early embryonic development are as follows: Fertilized zygote → Morula → Blastula → Gastrula → Neurula. Gastrulation occurs well after the zygote has already undergone several rounds of cell division (cleavage); therefore, this answer option is incorrect. Option C. Zygote rapidly increases rate of cell division – This option is incorrect because this process occurs well before the process of gastrulation. The rapid increase in cell division without significant growth is known as cleavage. This process occurs before gastrulation and transforms the zygote into a multicellular structure called a blastula. Option E. Implantation of the embryo in the uterine lining – This option is incorrect because gastrulation occurs after implantation of the embryo in the uterine lining. It is the blastocyst stage that implants into the uterus, and gastrulation only occurs after this stage has already been reached. Implantation provides nutritional support, hormonal regulation, and protection to the embryo. In short, implantation provides the necessary physiological conditions for gastrulation to occur successfully.",

      "concept_text": "Non-disjunction describes the failure of one or multiple chromosome pairs to separate during anaphase. Nondisjunction may occur during meiosis I, which results in the failure of homologous dyads to separate. Nondisjunction can also occur during meiosis II, which results in a failure of identical sister chromatids to separate. And finally, nondisjunction can occur during mitosis, which, similar to nondisjunction in meiosis II, results in the failure of identical sister chromatids to separate. Recall that humans are diploid, which means humans have homologous pairs of chromosomes. Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, resulting in a total count of 46 chromosomes. When a nondisjunction event occurs, this can lead to one or more of those chromosome pairs having a missing copy or an extra copy of a chromosome. When there is an extra copy of a particular chromosome (3 copies), it is called a trisomy .  Down syndrome is trisomy at chromosome 21. This means that there was a non-disjunction at chromosome 21, resulting in a zygote with 47 chromosomes (2n+1). Because down syndrome is caused by non-disjunction , Option D . is the correct answer to this question. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Crossover error – This option is incorrect .  Crossing over occurs during prophase 1 of meiosis I. Recall that during prophase I, homologous dyads synapse with each other to form tetrads. The precise location where the chromosomes cross over is known as the chiasma. When a chiasma is formed, DNA is exchanged between the maternal and paternal chromosomes. This helps increase the genetic diversity of the resulting gametes via meiosis. Down syndrome is not a result of a crossover error; therefore, this option is incorrect. Option B. Missense mutation – This option is incorrect .  A missense mutation is a change in the DNA code such that the original codon has been altered and codes for a different amino acid. A missense mutation can have minor or drastic effects depending on the new amino acid that is being coded for. Down syndrome is not a result of a missense mutation; therefore, this option is incorrect. Option C . Chromosome deletion – This option is incorrect .  While a nondisjunction event can lead to a missing copy of a particular chromosome, known as a monosomy, down syndrome is a result of a trisomy of chromosome #21. In other words, individuals with down syndrome possess an extra chromosome, not a missing chromosome. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option E. Nonsense mutation – This option is incorrect .  A nonsense mutation is a change in the DNA code such that the original codon that has been altered now codes for the stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA). This stop codon results in a shorter polypeptide chain which can have drastic effects on the protein’s function. Down syndrome is not a result of a nonsense mutation; therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "A species is a group of individuals in which members of the appropriate sex can reproduce and give rise to fertile offspring . In other words, members of the same species can reproduce and give rise to offspring that can also go on and successfully give rise to offspring of their own. For example, all dogs belong to the same species. Whether it's a Golden Retriever or a Chihuahua, they can mate and have puppies that can also grow up and have puppies of their own. On the other hand, a cat and a dog cannot mate and have offspring. Therefore, they are said to be reproductively isolated from each other and belong to different species. This inability to interbreed is the key factor that separates one species from another. Speciation is the development of a new species. For speciation to occur, there MUST be reproductive isolation. Without reproductive isolation, individuals from different populations would continue to interbreed. Over time, the genetic differences that could have led to the formation of distinct species (i.e. speciation) would be diluted or lost. Speciation can occur in one of two ways: allopatric speciation or sympatric speciation. Allopatric speciation is the development of a new species with the presence of a geographical barrier (like a mountain or a river). Sympatric speciation is the development of a new species without the presence of a geographical barrier. While allopatric speciation and sympatric speciation are slightly different, the commonality between the two is that a particular species has become reproductively isolated which led to the speciation event occurring. Because speciation requires reproductive isolation, Option C . is the correct answer to this question.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Isolated chemically – This option is incorrect . Recall that speciation requires reproductive isolation, not chemical isolation. Recall that most organisms on Earth are carbon-based and rely on similar fundamental chemical reactions and biochemical pathways. The vast majority of life on Earth is made of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that different species are isolated chemically, which makes this an incorrect answer option. Option B. Isolated metabolically – This option is incorrect . Recall that speciation requires reproductive isolation, not metabolic isolation. Metabolism has very little to do with speciation. Nevertheless, there are countless examples of different species sharing the same type of metabolism. The two main types of metabolism are catabolism (breaking down molecules to obtain energy) and anabolism (an organism synthesizing all the compounds needed by its cells/tissues). Many different species share similar metabolic pathways. For instance, glycolysis, the process of breaking down glucose to produce energy, is found across a wide array of organisms, from bacteria to humans. This indicates that metabolic processes are often conserved across different species. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option D. Isolated geographically – This option is incorrect . Recall that speciation requires reproductive isolation, not geographical isolation. Consider humans that live in the United States and Australia, for example. The US and Australia are geographically isolated but the humans in the US aren’t evolving into a different species compared to their Australian counterparts, and they are still able to interbreed. Geographic isolation over very long periods of time can potentially lead to speciation and reproductive isolation, but geographic isolation by itself does not define a species. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option E. Isolated ecologically – This option is incorrect . Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with other organisms and their environment. Being isolated ecologically is similar to being isolated geographically. Recall that speciation requires reproductive isolation, not ecological isolation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "For your test, it is important to know these four secondary messengers: cyclic AMP (cAMP), inositol triphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG) , and calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) . Recall that some hormones are lipid-soluble (hydrophobic) and therefore, are permeable to the cell membrane. Steroid hormones, like testosterone and estrogen, are hydrophobic and can therefore freely diffuse across the cell membrane. In addition, certain tyrosine-derived hormones like thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are also hydrophobic and can freely diffuse across the cell membrane. However, hydrophilic (water-soluble) hormones are unable to freely diffuse across the cell membrane. Peptide hormones, like follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and antidiuretic hormone (ADH), are hydrophilic and therefore, cannot freely diffuse across the cell membrane. Keep in mind that there are many more peptide hormones than the examples given here. In addition, certain tyrosine-derived hormones are also hydrophilic, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. As such, these hormones are also unable to freely diffuse across the cell membrane. Since hydrophilic (water-soluble) hormones are unable to freely diffuse across the cell membrane, they require the activation of secondary messengers to affect the target cell. When hydrophilic hormones reach their target cell, they bind to surface cell receptors. An example of a surface cell receptor is the G protein-coupled receptor. Once the hormone has bound to the surface cell receptor, it will activate a secondary messenger to essentially tell the cell what the hormone wants it to do. When looking at the answer choices, we notice that A, B, and D are all examples of secondary messengers. For secondary messengers to facilitate an intracellular response, there must be an increase in the concentration of that secondary messenger (as this is a result of activating secondary messenger pathways). Since Option D. is the only answer choice involving the increase of a secondary messenger, this option is correct .",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Decrease in Ca 2+ – This option is incorrect . Recall that Ca 2+ is one of the four secondary messengers you need to know for your test. Calcium acts as a secondary messenger by rapidly changing its concentration within the cell in response to external signals. This change in concentration triggers the binding of calcium to proteins, which then activates various enzymes and proteins. These activated molecules initiate cellular responses such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. For a secondary messenger to lead to an intracellular response, there must be an increase in the concentration of that secondary messenger. Because this answer choice involves a decrease in Ca 2+ , not an increase, this option is incorrect. Option B. Decrease in IP3 – This option is incorrect . Recall that IP3 (inositol trisphosphate) is one of the four secondary messengers you need to know for your test, and it plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes. An increase in IP3 concentration specifically leads to the release of calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) from the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering downstream signaling cascades that can lead to diverse cellular responses such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, or gene expression. For a secondary messenger to lead to an intracellular response, there must be an increase in the concentration of that secondary messenger. Because this answer choice involves a decrease in IP3, not an increase, this option is incorrect Option C. Increase in cholesterol – This option is incorrect . Cholesterol is not a secondary messenger. Cholesterol can be found integrated into the plasma membrane and is a precursor to steroid hormones.

      "concept_text": "Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions. Enzymes can either be proteins or RNA macromolecules (ribozymes). They allow reactions to occur faster by providing an alternative reaction pathway that has lower activation energy. As a result, enzymes allow equilibrium to be achieved at a faster rate. It is vitally important to remember that enzymes only change the energy of the transition state of a reaction – enzymes are not capable of making a non-spontaneous reaction into a spontaneous one. Enzymes are also not used up during a reaction, therefore, they are not considered reactants. Instead, enzymes have an active site where reactants can bind and unbind. Enzymes bind to substrates via weak, non-covalent bonds which is why substrates can unbind to enzymes with relative ease. Enzymes are substrate-specific and can only be bound to certain substrates. Enzymes are also not ‘used up’ during the reaction, therefore, an enzyme can be used repeatedly to continuously catalyze chemical reactions. Always remember, an enzyme does NOT change the free energy (ΔG) of a reaction! Although it does NOT change the equilibrium state or the enthalpy of formation (ΔH), it does increase the rate constant of the forward and reverse reactions! Here is an illustration to help visualize this concept: CC BY 4.0 Notice in the graphic that the Gibbs free energy of the products and reactants is the same whether or not an enzyme is present. This explains why the change in enthalpy (ΔH) and change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) remains constant with or without an enzyme. The only aspect of the reaction that is changed is the amount of activation energy required for the reaction to proceed. For your test, it’s also important to know that enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules like inhibitors (molecules that decrease enzyme activity) and activators (molecules that increase activity). An enzyme’s activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH, and many enzymes are denatured when exposed to excessive heat, losing their structure and catalytic properties.

Recall that there are four primary tissue types in the human body: Blood is a form of connective tissue because of its structure, function, and embryonic origin. Firstly, blood cells have an extracellular matrix – a key characteristic of connective tissue. Blood is comprised of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets all of which are suspended in a liquid extracellular matrix called plasma. One of the primary functions of blood is the transport of oxygen and other nutrients to bodily tissues throughout the body, thereby connecting numerous parts of the body to each other. Moreover, just like all other types of connective tissue, blood originates from the mesoderm during embryonic development. Because blood is a form of connective tissue, Option A is the correct answer to this question.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Cardiac tissue – This option is incorrect because cardiac tissue/muscle is a form of muscular tissue. Recall that there are three different types of muscle: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle. Cardiac muscle is not one of the four primary tissue types. Rather, cardiac muscle is the specialized muscle tissue that is found only in the heart. It contracts involuntarily and has a striated appearance due to the arrangement of its contractile proteins. Cardiac muscle cells are branched and connected by intercalated discs, which contain gap junctions that allow for the rapid spread of electrical signals throughout the heart. These features enable the heart to contract with perfect timing, which ensures efficient pumping of blood throughout the body. Option C. Epithelial tissue – This option is incorrect because blood is not a form of epithelial tissue. Epithelial tissue covers the surface of many internal and external structures of the body. For example, the epidermis of our skin is comprised of stratified squamous epithelia. Epithelial tissues also line our organs and glands, protecting them from injury and infection. Additionally, these tissues play a crucial role in absorption, secretion, and sensation. They form a barrier between the body and the external environment, regulating the passage of substances in and out of the body. This barrier is essential for maintaining homeostasis and protecting against pathogens. Since blood is not a form of epithelial tissue, this option is incorrect. Option D. Nervous tissue – This option is incorrect . Nervous tissue is the tissue that makes up the brain, spinal cord, and neurons of the body. Nervous tissue specializes in the transmission of information throughout the body and relies on action potentials that are transmitted between neurons (basic functional unit of the nervous system). This communication is essential for sensory perception, motor control, and cognitive function. Blood, on the other hand, is not a form of nervous tissue – it is a connective tissue with a very different role in the body. Option E. Muscular tissue – This option is incorrect . Muscular tissue, as the name suggests, makes up the muscles of the body. Three different types of muscle can be found in the body: smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle contracts involuntarily and is found in the walls of organs like the stomach and intestines, where it helps with digestion and controlling organ volume. Skeletal muscle is voluntary and attached to bones, allowing us to move our limbs and perform various physical activities. Cardiac muscle is involuntary and forms the heart wall, responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. Blood is a form of connective tissue – not a form of muscular tissue.",

      "concept_text": "Evolution occurs when allele frequencies within a population change over successive generations. These changes can be driven by various mechanisms, including gene flow, natural selection, and genetic drift. Natural selection is the increase and decrease of allele frequencies due to adaptations to the environment. Gene flow is the introduction and removal of alleles from the population when individuals leave (emigration) or enter the population. Genetic drift is the random increase and decrease of an allele, notably in small populations. This can lead to the loss of certain alleles or the fixation of others, purely by chance. Therefore, Option C, Genetic drift , is the correct answer. Two special types of genetic drift are the bottleneck effect and the founder effect. The bottleneck effect occurs when the population undergoes a dramatic decrease in size due to natural catastrophes or other events. As a result of the decrease in size, the population is now vulnerable to genetic drift (random changes in alleles can have a greater impact in small populations). The founder effect occurs when a small group of individuals breaks off from a larger population and becomes isolated. The new population may carry a small fraction of the genetic variation of the original population due to the random sampling of alleles (e.g. small group that broke off has a higher proportion of green-eyed individuals compared to the original population). If this small group remains isolated and interbreeds, genetic drift occurs.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Hybrid vigor – This option is incorrect. Hybrid vigor describes a situation where a crossbred individual experiences superior qualities to those of both parents. This superiority is caused by the reduction in harmful homozygous recessive alleles and the increase in beneficial heterozygous advantage. In hybrid vigor, because each of the two parent lines is inbred and likely homozygous recessive for diseases or defective alleles, the crossing of the two different lines (hence ‘hybrid’) will result in offspring with a more diverse set of alleles and therefore, improved yield, size, and growth rate, etc. It's a positive outcome of genetic mixing, not a random change in allele frequency within a single population, which makes this answer option incorrect. Option B. Gene flow – This option is incorrect . Gene flow describes the transfer of genetic variation from one population to the other because of emigration. While gene flow can change allele frequencies, it's not a random process within a single, small population; gene flow is more about the exchange of alleles between different groups. Therefore, this answer option is incorrect. Option D. Stabilizing selection – This option is incorrect . Stabilizing selection describes the tendency of intermediate values in a population to be favored over extreme values, forming a bell curve. For example, a new virus kills those who are extremely short and those who are extremely tall in a population, while those who are closer to the mean survive. This event is considered “stabilizing” because it “selects” the mean value (closer to the peak of the bell curve). Stabilizing selection is not a random event. A few other types of selection are Directional, Industrial, and Disruptive selection. Option E. Gametogenesis – This option is incorrect . Gametogenesis is the process of forming gametes (sex cells like sperm and eggs). While it involves the crucial step of allele shuffling (crossing over occurring during meiosis), gametogenesis does not cause random changes in allele frequencies within an entire population. Rather, gametogenesis increases genetic diversity for the individual. Therefore, this answer option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Hemoglobin also returns some of the carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs for disposal, however, most of the carbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate ions (HCO 3 ⁻) in plasma. Hemoglobin is a tetramer, meaning it consists of four polypeptide subunits, each containing an iron atom bound to a heme group. These heme groups are crucial as they bind oxygen molecules (each iron atom binds to one oxygen molecule). The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is cooperative , meaning that the binding of one oxygen molecule increases the affinity of hemoglobin for additional oxygen molecules. This property is essential for efficient oxygen uptake in the lungs and release in the tissues. However, while hemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen, this bond is reversible. This reversibility is crucial for hemoglobin's function, allowing it to pick up oxygen in the lungs and release it where it's needed in the body. If this high affinity were not reversible, hemoglobin would be unable to let go of oxygen molecules once bonded. In fact, this is precisely the reason carbon monoxide is so dangerous. Carbon monoxide (CO) has an extremely high affinity for hemoglobin – significantly higher than the binding affinity oxygen has for hemoglobin. Once carbon monoxide is bound to hemoglobin, it does not readily dissociate, meaning that the normal mechanisms the body uses to exchange gases are not effective. While oxygen binds to hemoglobin and is easily released in response to oxygen demand by tissue, carbon monoxide remains bound unless it can be physically displaced by an overabundance of oxygen molecules. This competitive binding is why high concentrations of oxygen are used in treatment. To put things into perspective, carbon monoxide has over 200 times greater affinity for hemoglobin compared to oxygen. This is what makes it such a dangerous chemical when inhaled and is the reason the bond between carbon monoxide and hemoglobin is so difficult to break. Therefore, Option A, Carbon monoxide , is the correct answer. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Oxygen – This option is incorrect because oxygen is not difficult to unbind from hemoglobin. Remember, while it is true that oxygen has a high affinity for oxygen, the strong bond between the two is reversible. That is, hemoglobin can easily bind to oxygen, keep a strong hold, and then easily release oxygen when the time is right (near oxygen-thirsty tissue). Therefore, oxygen is not difficult to unbind from hemoglobin, as suggested in this answer option. Option C. Nitrogen – This option is incorrect . Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, making up almost 80% of the air we breathe. However, nitrogen has no significant physiological role in the respiratory process of the body and does not bind to hemoglobin. It is mostly inert and is exhaled in the same form as it is inhaled. Therefore, nitrogen is not relevant when discussing the binding affinities to hemoglobin. Option D. Carbon dioxide – This option is incorrect because carbon dioxide does not have a very strong affinity for hemoglobin. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are not direct competitors for the same binding site on hemoglobin. Oxygen binds to the iron atom in the heme group of hemoglobin, whereas carbon dioxide primarily binds to the protein portion of hemoglobin. It’s important to remember that while oxygen and carbon dioxide don't compete for the same binding site, the binding of carbon dioxide can induce conformational changes in hemoglobin that decrease its affinity for oxygen – a phenomenon known as the Bohr effect. Option E. ATP – This option is incorrect . ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy carrier in cells, playing a crucial role in various biological processes. However, it does not have any specific binding affinity for hemoglobin. ATP's role is related to providing energy for key biological processes when being hydrolyzed to release energy. Hemoglobin, on the other hand, is found in red blood cells and operates in the bloodstream to transport oxygen. A strong binding affinity between hemoglobin and ATP is unlikely and unnecessary for biological processes.",

      "concept_text": "Neurons are the basic functional units of the nervous system; they are the core component of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerve tissue. Neurons receive and transmit signals by using electrochemical signaling molecules that send messages from one cell to the next. Neurons don't directly touch each other – instead, they communicate across a tiny gap called the synaptic cleft . The term synapse is a more “zoomed out” term that describes the various components that make up the junction of two neurons. It includes the presynaptic neuron (neuron sending the signal), the synaptic cleft, and the postsynaptic neuron (neuron receiving the signal). Therefore, the correct answer to this question is Option C , Synapse. CC BY 4.0 Communication begins when a neuron’s dendrites receive signals, either from sensory receptors or other neurons. These signals, often chemical neurotransmitters, cause changes in the neuron's electrical potential. If the change reaches a threshold, it triggers an action potential, a wave of electrical depolarization that travels down the axon. This action potential propagation is due to the rapid opening and closing of ion channels along the axon's membrane. The myelin sheath, an insulating layer around the axon, facilitates faster transmission by allowing the action potential to \"jump\" between gaps called Nodes of Ranvier. Finally, the action potential reaches the axon terminals. This influx of electrical charge triggers the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the next neuron's dendrites, continuing the communication process. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Tight junction – This option is incorrect because tight junctions are primarily found in epithelial tissue, such as the lining of the stomach – not in nerve tissue. Their main function is to create a barrier that prevents leakage of substances between cells. While important for maintaining the integrity of tissues, tight junctions are not involved in the transmission of signals between neurons. Option B. Cristae – This option is incorrect because cristae are found in mitochondria – not neurons. Cristae are highly folded areas of the inner membrane of mitochondria that increase the surface area available for cellular respiration to occur. Cristae are crucially important for the production of ATP within a cell, including neurons. While neurons need energy to function, cristae are not directly involved in the junction between neurons, making this answer option incorrect. Option D. Node of Ranvier – This option is incorrect because Nodes of Ranvier are a feature of a single neuron’s structure – not a junction between two neurons. As seen in the first image above, Nodes of Ranvier are gaps in the myelin sheath that insulates the axons of many neurons. These gaps play a crucial role in speeding up the transmission of electrical signals along the axon, by allowing the action potential to travel continuously down the axon, jumping from node to node. Option E. Intercalated disc – This option is incorrect because intercalated discs are unique to cardiac tissue. They are the contact points between adjacent cardiomyocytes that connect heart cells to each other via desmosomes and tight junctions. While they contribute to the transduction of electrical signals in the heart, intercalated discs are not found in neurons, and they do not contribute to the junction between two neurons; therefore, this answer option is incorrect.",

      "concept_text": "The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are brain structures that are key components of the endocrine system, acting as its command center. The hypothalamus produces and releases hormones that either directly trigger responses in the body or regulate the pituitary gland. Several of the hormones produced by the hypothalamus are referred to as “releasing” hormones because they trigger the release of other hormones. Namely, the hypothalamus produces Gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ), TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone), Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). These are known as tropic hormones because they do not directly induce their effect on the target tissue. Rather, tropic hormones target other endocrine glands that, once stimulated by the tropic hormone, release a different hormone that directly induces the physiological effect on the body. As seen in the figure below, GnRH directly stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and FSH (Follicle-stimulating hormone). Recall that LH and FSH function to stimulate the growth and development of the gonads in males and females (testes and ovaries, respectively), hence the name Gonadotropin-releasing hormone. As such, Option E , LH , is the correct answer . Canadian DAT Pro Tip: The hypothalamus does not release only tropic hormones. The hypothalamus also produces Oxytocin and Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), two non-tropic hormones, which go on to be stored in the posterior pituitary, where they will be later released from.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. ACTH – This option is incorrect because GnRH does not stimulate the release of ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone). Rather, the release of ACTH is directly stimulated by CRH (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone). CRH is produced in the hypothalamus (just like GnRH), but it acts on a different set of cells in the pituitary. When CRH is secreted, it signals the pituitary to produce and release ACTH. ACTH then travels through the bloodstream to the adrenal glands, located atop the kidneys. There, it stimulates the production and release of cortisol, a key stress hormone that helps the body mobilize energy, regulate blood pressure, and suppress inflammation. Option B. Testosterone – This option is incorrect because GnRH does not directly stimulate the release of testosterone. As seen in the image above, testosterone is produced in the Leydig cells of the testes (in males) and, to a lesser extent, the adrenal glands (in both sexes). Option C. GH – This option is incorrect because GnRH does not stimulate the release of GH (Growth Hormone). Instead, GH is produced and released by the anterior pituitary gland, but its release is regulated by GHRH (Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone), which is released by the hypothalamus. GH stimulates bone and tissue growth. It also stimulates protein synthesis and the use of fats for energy. The release of GH is not stimulated by GnRH, making this answer option incorrect. Option D . T3 – This option is incorrect because GnRH does not stimulate the release of T3 (triiodothyronine). Instead, the release of T3 is initiated by TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone). Once released by the hypothalamus, TRH then stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to produce and release TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone). TSH, in turn, travels to the thyroid gland and triggers the production and release of T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine), which are the two primary thyroid hormones. Both T3 and T4 increase the basal metabolic rate in the body and contribute to tissue development in children.",

Since innate behaviors are present at birth that do not require the organism to learn these behaviors, Option A is the correct answer.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Operant conditioning – This option is incorrect. Operant conditioning is a form of associative learning by which an organism associates a behavior with a reward or punishment. An example of operant conditioning is offering a puppy a treat for going outside. In this case, offering a treat would be considered a positive reward. In the scenario in question, there is no acquisition of behavior due to the presence of a reward or punishment, therefore, this option is incorrect. Option C. Sensitization – This option is incorrect. Sensitization is when an animal increases a certain behavior whenever the stimulus that elicits that response is presented to that animal more often. One common example of sensitization is when children become excited at the sound of the school bell. When the children first start school, they don’t know much about the importance of the school bell. As children grow aware of what the school bell means, they begin to anticipate the sound of the bell. Sensitization is a non-associative learned behavior. Behaviors that are acquired through sensitization are not present at birth, therefore, this answer option is incorrect. Option D. Habituation – This option is incorrect. Habituation is the opposite of sensitization. Habituation is a learned behavior that allows animals to ignore meaningless stimuli and focus on other, more important stimuli. Habituation is a process by which animals decrease a particular response to a given stimulus the more often that the stimulus is presented. One example of habituation is seen among squirrels that inhabit certain college campuses. Most squirrels would run away when someone gets a certain distance from the squirrel. Campus squirrels, on the other hand, allow students to approach them at a much closer distance before running away. This is because the squirrels no longer associate the sight of students (the stimulus in this case) as a source of danger. Since the stimulus has become irrelevant, the squirrels will not waste energy to respond to the stimulus (run away).",

Examples of angiosperms include fruits, maple, oaks, grass, etc. The flower is the reproductive structure of an angiosperm and the major structures of the flower include the pistil, stamen, and the petals. The pistil is the female reproductive structure, and it is composed of three parts: the ovary, the style, and the stigma. The stigma is the most superior structure and is the landing site for pollen. The style is the tube that leads from the stigma down to the ovary. The ovary lies at the base of the style and is the site where ovules are produced. Recall that ovules contain the female gamete of the plant which are fertilized by pollen to develop into a seed! During pollination, pollen lands on the stigma before travelling down the style to the ovary. Once the pollen reaches the ovary, the pollen fertilizes the eggs found in the ovules of the ovary. When the pollen fertilizes the eggs, they develop into seeds. Because the stigma is the structure that pollen lands on during pollination, Option E . is the correct answer to this question.

      "concept_text": "Cellular respiration is a catabolic pathway (breakdown of macromolecules) that can be divided into 4 smaller pathways: glycolysis, pyruvate decarboxylation, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis is the first pathway of aerobic cellular respiration. Glycolysis involves the breakdown of a glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules. The net products from glycolysis are 2 pyruvate, 2 ATP, and 2 NADH. Glycolysis is a completely anaerobic process (does not require oxygen) that occurs in the cytosol of the cell. The first step of glycolysis is the phosphorylation of glucose via the hydrolysis of 1 ATP molecule. The phosphorylation is facilitated by an enzyme known as hexokinase . Once the glucose has been phosphorylated, it is now a glucose-6-phosphate molecule. This is a crucial step, as adding a charged phosphate molecule helps prevent the glucose from leaving the cell. This allows the molecule to remain intracellularly to be used in metabolic pathways. This glucose-6-phosphate will be converted into its isomer, fructose-6-phosphate via an enzyme known as isomerase. Fructose-6-phosphate will then be phosphorylated once again via the hydrolysis of ATP. The enzyme that facilitates the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate is known as phosphofructokinase (PFK) . When the fructose-6-phosphate gets phosphorylated, it becomes fructose-1,6-bisphosphate . This second phosphorylation step via PFK is the rate-determining step of glycolysis. The rest of glycolysis is not important to understand for the purposes of your test, however, it should be known that the net products from glycolysis are two pyruvate, 2 NADH, and 2 ATP. Because the first step of glycolysis is the phosphorylation of glucose to produce the intermediate glucose-6-phosphate, we know that Option B is the correct answer to this question. The image below depicts the first three steps of glycolysis. CC BY 4.0",

Recall that the net products of glycolysis from 1 glucose molecule are 2 pyruvate, 2 NADH, and 2 ATP. Recall that G3P undergoes a series of redox reactions to become pyruvate. This is the final step of glycolysis. The first step of glycolysis is the phosphorylation of glucose via hexokinase to become glucose-6-phosphate, not pyruvate. Option D. Hexokinase – This option is incorrect . Hexokinase is an enzyme that’s responsible for the phosphorylation of glucose to become glucose-6-phosphate. While this is the first step of glycolysis, hexokinase is merely the enzyme that helps carry out this phosphorylation. The product of the phosphorylation of glucose is glucose-6-phosphate, not hexokinase. Option E. Fructose-6-phosphate – This option is incorrect .

      "concept_text": "Maintaining genetic variability within a population and throughout successive generations is extremely important in the context of evolution. Without it, a population would be unable to adapt to new evolutionary pressures and would also experience increased inbreeding. Genetic recombination , also known as crossing over , is the most common way of increasing genetic variability within a population. Therefore, Option A , Genetic recombination , is the correct answer. In simple terms, genetic recombination is the exchange of DNA segments between paired homologous chromosomes (one from each parent) during the creation of gametes (sperm and egg cells). Crossing over occurs during prophase of meiosis I and begins when two homologous chromosomes (one inherited from each parent) pair up in a process known as synapsis. Each pair of homologous chromosomes — each made up of two sister chromatids — tightly align to form a structure called a tetrad. The formation of this structure is necessary for segments of the chromosomes to be swapped between the homologous pairs, and thus create new and genetically unique chromosomes for the gamete. Canadian DAT Pro Tip: Genetic recombination occurs only in meiosis and not mitosis (recall that mitosis creates genetically identical daughter cells).",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Non-random mating – This option is incorrect. Put simply, non-random mating occurs when individuals choose who they want to mate with (as opposed to mating with an individual picked at random). This option is incorrect because non-random mating may increase or decrease genetic variability within a population. Inbreeding can decrease genetic variability by increasing the frequency of homozygous genotypes, which can lead to the expression of recessive deleterious alleles and reduce overall genetic variation. In contrast, outbreeding can introduce new alleles into a population and increase heterozygosity, which can lead to greater genetic variability . Option C. Transformation – This option is incorrect because transformation is a process where bacteria take up DNA from their environment. While transformation can increase genetic variability in bacteria, it's not a mechanism for increasing genetic variability in humans. Human cells lack the native ability to take up free DNA from the environment, and even if they could, the foreign DNA would likely be degraded or silenced by the immune system. Option D. Mutualism – This option is incorrect. Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship where two organisms both benefit from the other’s presence. Mutualism can lead to coevolution, where two species adapt to each other's presence over time. However, mutualism doesn't directly increase genetic variability within a species. It might indirectly influence gene frequencies if certain traits become more advantageous due to the mutualistic relationship, but it doesn't directly increase genetic variability (such as creating new alleles or gene combinations). Option E. Mutation – This option is incorrect . While mutations are certainly a mode of increasing genetic variability within a human population, they are nowhere near as common nor as impactful as genetic recombination. A single mutation might introduce a new allele into a population, but it takes many generations for that allele to become widespread. In contrast, genetic recombination creates millions of new gene combinations in every generation, making it a much more significant driver of genetic variability than mutation alone.",

      "concept_text": "When analyzing a pedigree, recall that boxes represent males and circles represent females. What should stand out in this pedigree is that in the F1 generation (first set of offspring) two siblings mate with each other. Individuals 3 & 4 are siblings (both offspring of individuals 1 & 2) who interbred to give rise to individual 5. Upon further analysis of the pedigree, there are two more instances of inbreeding. Individuals 7 & 8 (first cousins) interbreed to give rise to individual 10. Individuals 12 & 13 (second cousins) interbreed to give rise to individual 15. In the pedigree chart, this inbreeding between genetically related individuals is represented with two horizontal lines rather than the usual one. One of the primary risks of interbreeding is the heightened likelihood of offspring inheriting harmful recessive alleles . Recessive alleles are gene variants that only manifest when an individual possesses two copies, one from each parent. In closely related individuals, the chances of both parents carrying the same recessive allele are significantly increased due to their shared ancestry. When these alleles combine in offspring, it can lead to the expression of various genetic conditions. Therefore, Option A, Recessive conditions , is the correct answer. Interbreeding not only increases the risk of genetic disorders but also decreases genetic diversity within a population (that is, the variety of genes and alleles present within a population). This diversity is crucial for adaptation and survival, as it provides a range of traits that can be beneficial in different environmental conditions. When closely related individuals mate, the gene pool becomes smaller, limiting the available genetic variations.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Hybrid vigor – This option is incorrect . Hybrid vigor is caused by the opposite of inbreeding; hybrid vigor is caused by outbreeding (breeding of unrelated or distantly related individuals). Hybrid vigor describes a situation where the offspring of two inbred (but unrelated) strains experience more advantages than either parent. This superiority is caused by the reduction in harmful homozygous recessive alleles and the increase in beneficial heterozygous advantage. For example, the crossing of an inbred individual with a non-relative will result in offspring with a more diverse set of alleles and therefore, more beneficial traits. Option C. Point mutations – This option is incorrect . A point mutation is a mutation that results in the change/alteration of a single nucleotide base. Interbreeding itself does not directly cause point mutations. Point mutations occur randomly and spontaneously due to errors in DNA replication or exposure to mutagens. While inbreeding is not genetically favorable, it does not cause an increased rate of spontaneous mutations. The three types of point mutations are substitution (one base is replaced by another), insertion (an extra base is added to the sequence), and deletion (a base is removed from the sequence). Option D. Hayflick limit – This option is incorrect because the Hayflick limit is not a condition or event that occurs to individuals. Instead, the Hayflick limit refers to the maximum number of times a normal human cell can divide before it stops dividing and enters a state of senescence (cellular aging). The primary factor contributing to this limit is the shortening of telomeres. It makes no sense to say that inbreeding increases the risk of Hayflick limit, as this concept is unrelated to the inbreeding shown in the pedigree chart, making this answer option incorrect. Option E. Codominant inheritance – This option is incorrect because codominant inheritance is not a condition or event that occurs because of inbreeding. Rather, codominance is a type of inheritance where both alleles of a gene are expressed equally and independently in a heterozygote. That is, the phenotype (observable trait) of the heterozygote is a combination of both alleles, rather than one being dominant over the other. For example, the A and B alleles for blood type are codominant, therefore individuals with both alleles (AB blood type) express both A and B antigens on their red blood cells (as opposed to one allele being dominant over the other).",
