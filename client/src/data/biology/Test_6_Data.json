      "concept_text": "Retroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that use an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to make a DNA complement of their RNA genome by hijacking the host cell’s replication machinery. This DNA complement is then used to synthesize mRNA or enter the lysogenic cycle in order to become incorporated into the host DNA. A common example of retrovirus is HIV. HIV is classified as a retrovirus because it carries RNA instead of DNA, along with reverse transcriptase, to infect host cells. Since retroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses, Option B is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Double-stranded DNA virus – This option is incorrect because retroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses, not double-stranded DNA viruses. Retroviruses and double-stranded DNA viruses replicate in different ways. Double-stranded DNA viruses replicate by first replicating DNA and forming new viral DNA, then transcribing the new viral DNA to produce viral proteins that combine with DNA to form new viruses. Option C. Archaebacteria – This option is incorrect because archaebacteria are NOT viruses. While archaebacteria are living cells that can survive inside or outside a host, viruses lack independent metabolism and, therefore, are not considered truly “alive.” Archaebacteria are non-pathogenic prokaryotes that differ from regular bacteria. For example, archaea cell walls contain various polysaccharides, whereas bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan. Option D. Shark – This option is incorrect because sharks are eukaryotes and eukaryotes are NOT viruses. Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Viruses can neither be classified as prokaryotic nor eukaryotic as they are not made up of cells. Sharks, in particular, are vertebrate chordates: animals that have vertebrae that enclose the spinal cord. Option E. Lichen – This option is incorrect because lichens are classified as fungi and fungi are NOT viruses. While fungi are eukaryotic, viruses can neither be classified as prokaryotic nor eukaryotic as they are not made up of cells. Lichens, specifically, are symbiotic associations between fungi and algae or cyanobacteria. The fungi receive carbohydrates produced by algae or cyanobacteria via photosynthesis. The fungi, in return, provides nitrogen, water, protection from the environment (for example, toxic chemicals to protect against grazers), and/or UV light.",

      "concept_text": "Genetic disorders can either be autosomal or sex-linked. If a genetic disorder is autosomal , it is associated with an autosome (one of the numbered chromosomes). Humans have 22 pairs of autosomes. If a genetic disorder is sex-linked , it is associated with either the X chromosome or the Y chromosome. If a genetic disorder is Y-linked , all males with the disease-associated allele will be affected, since males only have one Y chromosome. (Males have XY chromosomes, indicating one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.) On the other hand, females cannot be affected by a Y-linked disorder, since females don’t have a Y chromosome. (Females have XX chromosomes, indicating two X chromosomes.) If a genetic disorder is X-linked , all males with the disease-associated allele will be affected, since males only have one X chromosome. Females with one disease-associated X allele and one unaffected X allele is a carrier . Carriers can display either partial or no symptoms. On the other hand, females with two disease-associated X alleles will be fully affected. Since the question indicates that the genetic disorder can affect both men and women, we can infer that the genetic disorder is X-linked because women cannot be affected by Y-linked disorders. Furthermore, the question indicates that the genetic disorder can lead to complete or partial blindness. Since partial symptoms can only occur when females have one disease-associated X allele and one unaffected X allele, we can once again infer that the disorder must be X-linked. Therefore, Option D is correct. Note: The genetic disorder described in this question is X-linked retinoschisis. X-linked retinoschisis is a genetic disorder causing the loss of central and peripheral vision due to degradation of the retina. Since X-linked retinoschisis is a X-linked genetic disorder, the gene causing the disease can be found on the X chromosome",

Chromosome 21, in fact, is associated with Down’s Syndrome. Down’s Syndrome is caused when there is an extra copy of Chromosome 21. Option B. Chromosome 15 – This option is incorrect because the genetic disorder is known to be sex-linked, while Chromosome 15 is NOT a sex chromosome. Option C. Any autosomal chromosome – This option is incorrect because the genetic disorder is known to be sex-linked. Hence, the gene causing the genetic disorder cannot be found on an autosomal chromosome. Option E. Y chromosome – This option is incorrect because the genetic disorder affects both men and women.

However, plants differ in their most prominent phase. While the tracheophytes (including seedless tracheophytes, seeded angiosperms, and gymnosperms) are found most prominently in the diploid sporophyte phase, bryophytes are found most prominently in their gametophyte phase. Therefore, Option A is correct. This dominance of the gametophyte phase and the lack of true vasculature characterize the bryophytes . CC BY 3.0",

Unlike bryophytes, angiosperms have vascular structures, and it should be noted that plants that have a dominant gametophyte generation will lack true vascular structure. Angiosperms (fruits, maple, oaks, grass, etc) are flowering plants and are the dominant land plant form. The flower is the reproductive structure of an angiosperm. Option C. Gymnosperm – This option is incorrect because gymnosperms are found most prominently in the diploid sporophyte phase. Unlike bryophytes, gymnosperms have vascular structures, and it should be noted that plants that have a dominant gametophyte generation will lack true vascular structure. Gymnosperms (pines, firs, spruces, junipers, redwoods, cedars, etc) are cone-bearing plants. They have pollen-bearing male cones and ovule-bearing female cones. Option D.

Unlke bryophytes, seedless tracheophytes have vascular structures, and it should be noted that plants that have a dominant gametophyte generation will lack true vascular structure. Seedless tracheophytes (clubmosses, spike mosses, quillworts, ferns, horsetails, whisk ferns, etc) have true roots, leaves, and stems, but lack seeds. Option E. Endosperm – This option is incorrect because the endosperm is not a plant, but rather a specific type of supportive tissue that provides nutrition to the developing embryo. The endosperm can be found in the seed of the plant along with the embryo and the seed coat. In many monocots, the endosperm is the primary storage tissue, and the cotyledons transfer nutrients from the endosperm to the embryo. The endosperm is formed when the second sperm cell of the pollen tube fuses with the polar nuclei.",

The foramen ovale is a small opening in the heart that allows blood to bypass pulmonary circulation by entering the left atrium directly from the right atrium, since there is no gas exchange in the fetal lung. The ductus arteriosus is a short vessel that conducts blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta, allowing it to bypass the lungs. Option B. Systemic circulation – This option is incorrect because the ductus venosus does NOT allow blood to bypass systemic circulation. Systemic circulation is a circulation pathway that allows blood to go to all body tissues. Option C.

      "concept_text": "Sperm (male sex cells) are made up of the head, mid-piece, and tail. The head of the sperm contains the acrosome, a lysosome-like organelle containing hydrolytic enzymes that allow sperm to digest through the zona pellucida to get to the oocyte. The zona pellucida is an external glycoprotein membrane surrounding the plasma membrane of an oocyte. Once sperm comes into contact with the zona pellucida, the zona pellucida expresses specific receptor proteins called ZP3 which bind to proteins expressed in the head of the sperm. Such binding of ZP3 triggers the acrosome reaction during which the acrosomal enzymes are released. These enzymes digest a path through the zona pellucida, allowing the sperm to enter the perivitelline space and ultimately fuse with the plasma membrane of the oocyte. Therefore, the absence of an acrosome would prevent sperm from penetrating the zona pellucida in order to reach the oocyte, fuse cell bodies, and share its genetic material in the process of fertilization. Since the inability to penetrate the zona pellucida is an immediate consequence of a defective sperm without an acrosome, Option E is correct. CC BY 4.0 CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. ATP depletion – This option is incorrect because the production of ATP is carried out by the mitochondria within the mid-piece of sperm. The midpiece of sperm contains the flagellum and lots of mitochondria. Hence, the absence of an acrosome will not have an effect on the sperm’s ATP. Option B. Complete immobility – This option is incorrect because movement is facilitated by the tail of the sperm, which is energized by the ATP made by the mitochondria in the mid-piece. The whiplike motion of the tail and mid-piece propels the sperm to move forward. Therefore, a mutation within the acrosome vesicle of sperm would not impact its mobility. Option C. Prevent the movement of sperm through follicular cells – This option is incorrect because the follicular cells are contained within the corona radiata layer of the oocyte, the penetration of which is not dependent on acrosomal enzymes. The corona radiata is a dense layer of granulosa cells surrounding the oocyte. The zona pellucida, instead, is the layer of the oocyte that is degraded by the acrosomal enzymes in order for sperm to reach the oocyte. Option D. Prevent fusion of sperm with zona pellucida – This option is incorrect because the acrosome is tasked with helping to penetrate past the zona pellucida, not fusing the sperm with it. The sperm fuses directly with the oocyte membrane instead after penetrating the zona pellucida.",

      "concept_text": "The menstrual cycle of the female reproductive cycle begins with the initiation of the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. Low levels of estrogen and progesterone stimulate the hypothalamus, causing it to secrete GnRH. GnRH then stimulates the anterior pituitary to release FSH and LH. The produced FSH stimulates the follicles to secrete estrogen. The increase in estrogen causes positive feedback on the hypothalamus, prompting it to produce more GnRH. The anterior pituitary then produces large amounts of LH. The surge of LH triggers ovulation, secreting estrogen and progesterone. The increase in estrogen and progesterone stimulates the thickening of the endometrium in preparation for implantation of the fertilized egg. Since high levels of progesterone cause the endometrial wall to thicken, Option E is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Ovulation – This option is incorrect because ovulation is NOT caused by high levels of progesterone; it is instead caused by a surge in LH. During ovulation, the ovary releases a secondary oocyte from its vesicular follicle. The secondary oocyte then enters and moves along the fallopian tube (oviduct). Option B. Triggers an LH surge – This option is incorrect because an LH surge is NOT caused by high levels of progesterone. When FSH stimulates follicles to secrete estrogen, the increased levels of estrogen triggers the hypothalamus to produce GnRH. The GnRH then causes the anterior pituitary to produce a surge of LH. The LH surge triggers ovulation, a process in which an egg is released from an ovary. Option C. Fertilization – This option is incorrect because fertilization is NOT caused by high levels of progesterone. Fertilization occurs when sperm penetrates the plasma membrane of a secondary oocyte. This process, however, cannot occur until capacitation and acrosomal reaction have taken place. During capacitation, the plasma membrane surrounding the head of the sperm is destabilized, allowing the sperm to become hyperactive. Once the sperm comes into contact with the zona pellucida of the oocyte, the receptor proteins (ZP3) of the zona pellucida bind to proteins in the head of the sperm. This binding triggers the acrosomal reaction in which the enzymatic contents of the acrosome are released. Option D. Lactation – This option is incorrect because lactation is NOT caused by high levels of progesterone. Prolactin and oxytocin are hormones associated with lactation. During lactation, prolactin promotes the production of milk and oxytocin promotes the ejection of milk. Hence, the effects of these hormones allow mothers to feed their babies and supply them with nutrients and antibodies essential for survival.",

This is an important concept to know for the test. The Lac operon in E. coli controls the breakdown of lactose. Three structural genes, lac Z, Y, and A, code for enzymes involved in lactose digestion. A regulatory gene produces an active repressor that binds to the operator and blocks RNA polymerase. When lactose is available, lacZ turns lactose into allolactose, which binds to the repressor and inactivates it, allowing RNA polymerase to attach and transcribe the genes. (Allolactose is a disaccharide that is an analogue of lactose; hence, lactose and allolactose can be used interchangeably in the context of the Lac operon.)

      "concept_text": "During the day when sunlight is abundant, plants are able to perform the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. The products of the light-dependent reactions (NAPDH and ATP) are then used to drive the dark reactions of photosynthesis, producing glucose. This glucose is used by the plant cell in aerobic respiration as a source of energy. However, in the absence of direct sunlight, the plant must be able to continue to sustain itself by using a stored energy source. Starch , a polymer of alpha-glucose molecules, functions as an energy storage in plant cells. Similar to how humans store excess glucose after a meal in the form of glycogen and break down the stored glycogen for glucose as needed, plant cells store excess glucose made during the day as starch. Plant cells store starch in storage vacuoles and plastids, specifically leucoplasts. Since plants cannot effectively perform photosynthesis during the night, they use built-up starch as an energy source; therefore, Option B is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Photosynthesis can use moonlight with lower efficiency – This option is incorrect because moonlight does not carry enough energy to excite electrons. In other words, plants cannot use moonlight to carry out photosynthesis. The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis are initiated by the light energy from the sun exciting the trapped electrons of photosystem II. The light energy from the sun is once again used to reenergize electrons in photosystem I. Option C. T he Calvin Cycle shuts off during sunlight but turns on in its absence – This option is incorrect because although the Calvin Cycle does not directly use sunlight, the Calvin Cycle is most active during the day, after the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis have produced enough NADPH and ATP. Without the NADPH and ATP from the light-dependent reactions, the “dark reactions” of photosynthesis are unable to occur to any significant extent, despite their name. Option D. Plants shut off cellular function during night time – This option is incorrect because plants continue to carry out cellular function during the night. If a plant completely shuts off cellular function at night, then the plant will not be able to survive as it will not be performing cellular respiration. Remember that a plant performs a number of cellular activities to maintain itself – not just photosynthesis – and these processes need to occur regardless of the time of day. Option E. Transpiration pulls up ATP from the soil for plants to use – This option is incorrect because transpiration does NOT pull up ATP from the soil for plants to use. In fact, plants do not obtain ATP from the soil; plants produce their own ATP through photophosphorylation. Transpiration, instead, pulls up water from the soil for plants to use. When water transpires out of a plant, a suction force is created in the xylem which causes water to be pulled up from the roots to the stem and leaves.",

As a result, different mRNA can be generated from the same RNA transcript by selectively removing different parts of a RNA transcript to create different combinations. The ability to alternatively splice RNA allows for the creation of multiple different proteins from one RNA strand. For example, in the figure below, pre-mRNA can be spliced in three different ways, resulting in three different proteins. Alternative splicing is only seen in eukaryotes, and allows them to express a diversity of proteins beyond what their number of genes would indicate, since a single gene can be used to create many different proteins.

Instead, alternative splicing allows for the creation of multiple different proteins. Option D.

The promoter region is upstream of the transcription start site and is not found on the resulting RNA strand (it does not get transcribed). Hence, there is no need for spliceosomes to delete promoter regions during alternative splicing because these regions simply do not exist on pre-mRNA. Option E. Combination of intron segments to create varying proteins – This option is incorrect because splicing causes intron segments to be removed, not combined, from the pre-mRNA to create varying proteins.

In turn, the corpus luteum continues to secrete estrogen and progesterone to maintain the endometrium for continued support of the developing embryo. If hCG is not present at the beginning of pregnancy, menstruation will begin and the embryo will abort because the endometrium will shed.

LH production is increased when the anterior pituitary is stimulated by the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.

TSH – This option is incorrect because thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) production would not be increased following fertility treatment with hCG. TSH production is increased when the anterior pituitary is stimulated by the production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. TSH, in fact, is completely uninvolved in reproduction. It instead functions to control the metabolism of the body. TSH stimulates the thyroid gland and causes it to increase in size and cell number. TSH also increases the rate of secretion of hormones T 3 (thyroxine) and T 4 (triiodothyronine). Option C. Oxytocin – This option is incorrect because oxytocin production would not be increased following fertility treatment with hCG. Oxytocin production is stimulated by uterine contractions during childbirth as well as contractions of the mammary glands during breastfeeding. As a result, oxytocin helps increase the strength of uterine contractions and milk ejection. Oxytocin also plays a role in facilitating maternal behavior and mother-infant bonding. Option E. Testosterone – This option is incorrect because testosterone production would not be increased following fertility treatment with hCG. Testosterone is a male sex hormone that is produced by Leydig cells of testes at the beginning of puberty. Male sex hormones, including testosterone, are secreted in the presence of LH.

      "concept_text": "Species diversity is the overall variety of different kinds of organisms in a community and consists of two components: species richness and relative abundance. Species richness represents the diversity of a community by describing the total number of different species present. Relative abundance reflects the amount of individuals in each species. Species richness on islands depends on island size and distance from the mainland . Species richness is directly proportional to a community’s geographic size. An increase in the area of a community leads to an increase in its diversity of habitats, resulting in an increase in the number of species. This concept is not restricted to only islands: generally speaking, the larger an area of environment that is present, the more species richness that would be observed. Furthermore, species richness is expected to decrease as an island’s distance from the mainland increases. If an island is far from the mainland, it has greater local extinctions and less immigration, causing a decrease in species richness. On the other hand, if an island is close to the mainland, the island will experience high levels of immigration, allowing more new species to be introduced to the community. We do not know the islands’ distance from the mainland for most of the options of this question; hence, we only need to take island size into account when ranking the islands’ species richness. Since species richness increases when a community’s geographic size increases, Option A is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Most isolated island – This option is incorrect because the most isolated island will have an extremely low species richness, regardless of its size. If an island is isolated from other communities, particularly the mainland, it will experience greater local extinctions and less immigration, resulting in a decrease in species richness. Option C. Oldest island  – This option is incorrect because the age of an island does not affect its species richness. Since we do not know the size of the island nor its distance from the mainland, we cannot determine its species richness. Option D. Island closest to another island – This option is incorrect because the proximity of an island to other islands is not the primary factor that affects species richness. An island's distance from the mainland, in fact, is a factor that affects species richness. Species richness declines as an island’s distance from the mainland increases. Option E. Tallest island – This option is incorrect because the height of an island does not affect its species richness. Island size is a factor that affects species richness on islands and it refers to the geographic area of the island, rather than height.",

      "concept_text": "During digestion, G cells of the stomach secrete gastrin , a large peptide hormone which is absorbed into blood. Gastrin then stimulates parietal cells of the stomach to secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl). The stomach is kept extremely acidic (pH of 2) in order to kill ingested bacteria and provide an optimal pH for pepsin, a digestive enzyme that degrades proteins into polypeptides. The release of HCl from parietal cells helps maintain the acidic environment of the stomach. Pepsin is originally secreted as pepsinogen from chief cells; however, HCl released by parietal cells helps to cleave pepsinogen into its active form of pepsin. Once the enzyme is activated, it can begin protein digestion. HCl also assists the absorption of vitamin B-12 in the ileum. Gastrin is a digestive hormone that is secreted from G cells in order to stimulate the HCl production of parietal cells. Since G cells and parietal cells are both located in the stomach, gastrin is a hormone that is secreted from the same organ that it targets. Therefore, Option D is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. T3 – This option is incorrect because while T3 is secreted from the thyroid gland, it targets the general body. In other words, T3 does not target a specific organ (or the thyroid gland itself). T3 is necessary for growth and neurological development in children. It also helps increase cellular metabolism (measured as the basal metabolic rate) of the body. Option B. Insulin – This option is incorrect because while insulin is secreted from the beta cells of the pancreas, it targets the liver, muscle cells, and fat tissues. Insulin stimulates these tissues to absorb glucose in order to lower blood glucose levels. Insulin does not target the pancreas itself. Insulin and glucagon are the two major peptide hormones involved in blood sugar regulation. Option C. Epinephrine – This option is incorrect because while epinephrine is secreted from the adrenal medulla, it targets many other tissues in the body rather than the adrenal medulla itself. Epinephrine stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and causes a “fight or flight” response, including the increase of blood glucose, blood pressure, and heartbeat.  While epinephrine increases blood flow to skeletal muscles, dilates the pupils, and increases the heart rate, it decreases blood flow to organs that are less relevant during a fight or flight situation, such as the intestines, bladder, etc. Epinephrine also increases metabolic activities and causes bronchodilation: the relaxation of smooth muscles in the airways. Option E. LH – This option is incorrect because while LH is secreted from the anterior pituitary, it targets the ovaries and testes. In females, LH stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum. A surge in LH can also trigger ovulation. Ovulation is a process in which a vesicular follicle of an ovary releases a secondary oocyte that can be fertilized by a sperm. In males, LH stimulates the Leydig cells of testes to produce testosterone.",

Since prokaryotes lack a nuclear membrane that separates the genetic material from the rest of the cytoplasm, simultaneous transcription and translation may occur as shown in the image below. As soon as RNA polymerase produces an mRNA from the DNA during transcription, ribosomes can immediately access this mRNA for translation into proteins. In contrast, eukaryotes have their genome isolated in the nucleus. Hence, once RNA is transcribed from DNA, it must be exported out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm in order for the ribosomes to carry out translation. Since archaebacteria is classified as a prokaryote and none of the other options belongs to the prokaryotic kingdom, Option E is correct. CC BY 4.0 Process of Elimination Option A. Fungi – This option is incorrect because fungi are eukaryotes with genetic material sequestered in a nucleus. Since the genetic material of fungi is separated from the rest of the cell via a nuclear membrane, simultaneous transcription and translation cannot occur. While not all fungi are multicellular, all fungi are eukaryotic heterotrophs that grow as filaments called hyphae and can reproduce sexually or asexually. Fungi are generally responsible for decomposition of biological waste. Option B. Eukaryota – This option is incorrect because eukaryotes have genetic material sequestered in a nucleus. Since the genetic material of eukaryotes is separated from the rest of the cell via a nuclear membrane, simultaneous transcription and translation cannot occur. Instead, RNA must be exported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm for ribosomes to begin the process of translation. Option C.

These hormones all retain the four-membered ring structure of cholesterol; however, differences in functional groups cause significant variations in functionality. Steroids include androgens, estrogens, progestogens, mineralocorticoids, and glucocorticoids. The former three steroids are collectively known as sex hormones . Examples include, respectively, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone. These hormones are essential for sexual development as they are involved in processes including puberty, pregnancy, menstruation, sperm production, and more.

In RNA, uracil (U) replaces thymine. The sequence of these nucleotide bases encodes genetic information in DNA and RNA. Option B. Glucose – This option is incorrect because glucose is a carbohydrate, and carbohydrates cannot be used to synthesize sex hormones. Lipids, specifically cholesterol, are used to synthesize sex hormones. Glucose can instead be used to make polysaccharides including starch, cellulose, and glycogen. Monosaccharides including glucose forms glycosidic linkages with one another to build polysaccharides. Glucose also fuels both aerobic and anaerobic respiration, allowing the production of energy.

      "concept_text": "Coevolution is a process where two species influence one another’s evolution. Evolutionary pressures from one species cause the other one to evolve, and vice versa. Predators and prey commonly undergo coevolution. For example, the evolution of a more effective predator will cause the prey to evolve better ways to escape or defend itself. In turn, evolutionary advancements in the prey force the predator to evolve to keep up with the prey species. Coevolution is not always due to predator and prey relationships, however – it can be seen in any two species that share significant interactions and closely adapt to one another over time due to mutual benefits. The relationship between hummingbirds and trumpet creeper flowers is a popular example of coevolution. Hummingbirds have evolved long beaks to be able to drink from trumpet creeper flowers, which have particularly long, tubular petals. The trumpet creeper’s elongated shape is closely adapted for the long beak of the hummingbird, which is advantageous for the flower as matching the shape of the hummingbird’s beak means that its pollen will be spread to other compatible trumpet creeper flowers for successful pollination. In turn, the elongated shape of the hummingbird beak is advantageous for the hummingbird as it provides it efficient access to the nectar of the flower. The shared benefits ultimately drive the coevolution seen between these two species. Since hummingbirds and trumpet creeper flowers demonstrate coevolution in which reciprocal evolution has occurred, Option C is correct. CC BY 4.0",

Dolphin fin and fish fin – This option is incorrect because dolphin fins and fish fins do not demonstrate coevolution; instead, they are an example of analogous structures. Analogous structures are body parts of different species (which do not share a common ancestor) that closely resemble one another. While these structures have evolved independently, they have similar functions due to adaptations to similar environments. Dolphins and fish are different species that do not come from a common ancestor. However, since both species live in an aquatic habitat, their fins resemble one another in appearance and function. Option B. Antibiotics and bacteria – This option is incorrect because antibiotics and bacteria do not demonstrate coevolution; instead, they are an example of natural selection. Natural selection refers to the survival of the fittest. In a population experiencing natural selection, allele frequencies increase or decrease in order to adapt to the environment. When bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, “weaker” bacteria (those without genes for antibiotic resistance) will die quicker compared to “stronger” bacteria (those with the genes for antibiotic resistance). Hence, bacteria that are less susceptible to the antibiotic will survive and pass on their genes to succeeding generations. As a result, bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics over time due to the resistant features that have been passed on through generations. Option D. Goats and cows – This option is incorrect because goats and cows are not an example of coevolution. Goats and cows are two different species that belong to the same family. However, these species do not share a significant evolutionary relationship and instead evolved independently from a common ancestor. Both are herbivores, and share adaptations for surviving on a vegetation-based diet, such as flat teeth and long digestive tracts. Option E. Human arm and cat leg – This option is incorrect because human arms and cat legs do not demonstrate coevolution; instead, they are an example of homologous structures resulting from divergent evolution. Homologous structures are similar body parts of different species that descended from a common ancestor. While homologous structures may or may not serve the same function, they share a physical resemblance. Since humans and cats share a common mammalian ancestor and the human arm and cat leg are similar in bone structure, human arms and cat legs are homologous structures.",

Prokaryotic cells cannot grow beyond this size range because of a limitation called the surface-area-to-volume ratio .

Hence, their surface-area-to-volume ratio gets smaller, making it harder for the cell to exchange nutrients and waste with the environment. If a cell is unable to efficiently exchange nutrients and waste with its environment, it will either begin cell division to increase surface area or die due to starvation and waste accumulation.

Hence, prokaryotic organisms have their own efficient ways of metabolism that do not interfere with their growth. Option C.

      "concept_text": "The carbon cycle describes the major reservoirs of carbon and the processes that drive the transport of carbon across those reservoirs. One of the major reservoirs of carbon is the atmosphere in the form of CO 2 . Atmospheric CO 2 is then absorbed by producers to carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis allows atmospheric CO 2 to be converted to organic forms that can be taken up by consumers and decomposers. After consuming carbon through food, consumers return carbon directly to the atmosphere through cellular respiration. Decomposers , also known as saprophytes , feed from dead, decaying matter by breaking the matter down through cellular respiration. Examples of decomposers include fungi and bacteria. These organisms secrete enzymes that can break down complex organic compounds into their components, which are then absorbed and broken down further in the process of cellular respiration. Hence, decomposers contribute to the carbon cycle as they help degrade organic matter into inorganic materials. The products of their cellular respiration include CO 2 , which is subsequently released into the atmosphere. Fossil fuel combustion is another source of atmospheric CO 2 . Fossil fuel combustion is the process of burning coal, oil, natural gases, or other fossil fuels to generate energy. Since decomposers make carbon available to plants in the form of CO 2 via cellular respiration, Option A is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option B. Decomposers incorporate carbon when they consume other organisms – This option is incorrect because while decomposers do consume other organisms, they do not “incorporate” carbon into other organisms during consumption. Decomposers break down organic matter from dead organisms into simpler inorganic materials without the incorporation of additional carbon. Option C. Decomposers’ dead body is left on soil for plant to absorb carbon – This option is incorrect because decomposers break down dead organic material and waste and then convert it into carbon dioxide via respiration. While incomplete decomposition and fossilization can form fossil fuels that are eventually combusted into atmospheric carbon, plants do not play a role in this particular process. Plants receive carbon through the process of photosynthesis as they take in carbon dioxide and ultimately fix it into organic carbon sources such as glucose. Option D. Nitrogen fixing bacteria utilize their enzymes to convert nitrogen to carbon – This option is incorrect because nitrogen fixing bacteria utilize their enzymes to convert atmospheric nitrogen (N 2 – an inorganic form of nitrogen) into organic forms of nitrogen (e.g. NH 4 + ) that can be incorporated into organic molecules, instead of converting nitrogen to carbon. Nitrogen fixing bacteria play a key role in the nitrogen cycle, not the carbon cycle. Option E. Decomposers do not participate in the carbon cycle – This option is incorrect because decomposers participate in the global carbon cycle by breaking down organic matter from dead organisms into simpler inorganic materials through cellular respiration. The products of decomposition are then released into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide, which can be used by plants in photosynthesis to continue the carbon cycle. The ability for decomposers to convert organic waste into inorganic carbon sources like carbon dioxide is a key component of the global carbon cycle.",

      "concept_text": "Ion channels are used to pass ions across the membrane. These channels are also referred to as gated channels in nerve and muscle cells. Voltage gated ion channels are a type of ion channel that responds to differences in membrane potential. During nerve impulse transmission, a stimulus causes gated ion channels to open and Na + ions to enter the axon, depolarizing the neuron. Once the threshold level is reached, an action potential is triggered. The action potential causes the opening of voltage gated Na + channels down the entire length of the neuron. In response to the influx of Na + ions, voltage gated K + channels let K + ions out of the cell, resulting in repolarization of the neuron. Motor end plate potentials are the voltages that cause the depolarization of skeletal muscle fibers at the motor end plate (the area where nerve and muscle fiber interface). When an action potential arrives at the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine is released. Acetylcholine then binds to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane that opens ligand gated Na + channels, which can eventually lead to sufficient voltage change to trigger the opening of voltage gated ion channels causing an action potential in the sarcolemma. As this action potential continues to travel along the T-tubules, the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases Ca 2+ through voltage gated Ca 2+ channels. This directly leads to muscle contraction, as the release of Ca 2+ prompts the formation of myosin cross bridges, resulting in Ca 2+ binding to troponin on an actin helix. The interactions between thick and thin filaments allow the sarcomere to shorten (a muscle contraction). At the end of each contraction cycle, Ca 2+ is actively pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Since action potentials, motor end plate potentials, and muscle contraction all require the activity of voltage gated ion channels, Option C is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Ligand gated ion channels – This option is incorrect because action potentials do not use ligand gated ion channels; therefore, ligand gated ion channels are not a common factor between all three processes mentioned in the question. Ligand gated ion channels are a type of ion channels that respond to the binding of neurotransmitters. While motor end plate potentials respond to the binding of acetylcholine to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane (eventually leading to muscle contraction), action potentials only use voltage gated ion channels. Option B. Mechanical gated ion channels – This option is incorrect because while mechanical gated ion channels are used to generate graded potentials, they are not directly used to generate action potentials, and play no role in motor end plates or muscle contraction. Mechanical gated ion channels respond to pressure or vibration and are found in sensory receptors in the skin, ear, etc. The graded potentials generated by these ion channels can surpass the threshold potential, subsequently triggering voltage gated ion channels to generate an action potential. While mechanical gated ion channels can indirectly trigger an action potential through the generation of graded potentials, they are not directly used to generate an action potential. Therefore, mechanical gated ion channels are not a common factor between all three processes mentioned in the question. Option D. cAMP – This option is incorrect because cAMP (cyclic AMP) is a secondary messenger used for intracellular signal transduction. Secondary messengers are molecules that relay signals received by cell-surface receptors. Since action potentials, motor end plate potentials, and muscle contraction are intercellular processes that occur between cells instead of inside a single cell, cAMP is not a common factor between all three processes mentioned in the question. Option E. Mitotic spindle – This option is incorrect because the mitotic spindle is not involved in action potentials, motor end plate potentials, and muscle contraction. The mitotic spindle is developed during prophase of mitosis and meiosis. The mitotic spindle attaches to chromosomes and later separates them by pulling them to opposite poles of the nucleus.",

Since the question is asking for the most effective technique for evaluating the expression of multiple genes and DNA microarray can simultaneously evaluate large groups of genes, Option B is correct. DNA microarray begins with sample isolation and preparation in which mRNA is isolated from cells. Once mRNA is isolated, it undergoes reverse transcriptase labeling for conversion into cDNA. mRNA must be converted to cDNA because cDNA is more convenient to work with: while mRNA is composed of both coding and noncoding sequences, cDNA only contains coding sequences. The cDNA is then placed in wells. Each well contains identical copies of cDNA fragments that each carry a specific gene. If a gene from the target DNA strand was expressed in a certain tissue, it binds to the cDNA inside the well; however, if a gene was not expressed, there would be no gene product to bind to the cDNA. Upon hybridization between cDNA segments and the target DNA strand, fluorescence occurs and can be measured via detectors, and the relative abundance of the target sequences can be shown in order to assess their expression. The image below illustrates the detailed steps of DNA microarray. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. PCR – This option is incorrect because PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a technique used to amplify the amount of DNA, having no impact on evaluating gene expression. PCR consists of three steps: denaturation, annealing, and elongation. Once high heat separates double stranded DNA, the sample is cooled to allow the attachment of primers onto the separated strands. Polymerase then synthesizes new strands of DNA. This cycle repeats to increase the amount of DNA exponentially. Option C. Karyotyping – This option is incorrect because karyotyping is a laboratory technique used to study the chromosomes of a cell. It involves the staining and photographing of chromosomes from a sample of cells in order to visually analyze the number and structure of the chromosomes. Karyotyping can be used to check for visually observable chromosomal abnormalities. For example, karyotyping can help diagnose Down Syndrome by identifying trisomy 21 (three chromosomes at position 21). While karyotyping can identify such chromosomal defects, it cannot be used to analyze gene expression in any way. Option D. Gel electrophoresis – This option is incorrect because gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate and analyze DNA, RNA, or proteins based on their size and charge. Small molecules can travel relatively farther down the gel. After separating DNA samples, it can be sequenced or probed to locate specific sequences. While gel electrophoresis can only separate molecules based on size and charge, it cannot be used to evaluate gene expression. Option E. Western blot – This option is incorrect because Western Blot is a technique used to detect and quantify specific proteins in a sample. It involves the separation of proteins by size using gel electrophoresis, followed by the transfer of the separated proteins onto a nitrocellulose gel membrane. Once the proteins are transferred onto the membrane, a probe is added to hybridize and mark the target fragment. Western Blot can detect and quantify specific proteins in a sample, which can reflect whether or not individual genes are being expressed. However, Western blotting cannot be used to evaluate the expression of multiple genes simultaneously.",

These hormones are necessary for growth and neurological development in children as well as increasing basal metabolic rate in the body. The basal metabolic rate is the amount of energy per unit of time that a person requires to keep the body functioning at rest. The undersecretion of these hormones causes hypothyroidism in which the heart rate, respiratory rate, and basal metabolic rate are lowered. On the other hand, the oversecretion of these hormones cause hyperthyroidism in which the basal metabolic rate and sweating are increased. Individuals suffering from hyperthyroidism notably tend to be very thin and have low levels of fat mass due to their excessively increased metabolism. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can lead to formation of a goiter, the enlargement of the thyroid gland. It is important to know for the test that the element iodine is necessary for thyroid hormone synthesis. Since T3 and T4 both functions to increase metabolism (basal metabolic rate) in the body, Option B is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Increases muscle mass – This option is incorrect because thyroid hormones have no direct effect on skeletal muscle. Human growth hormone (GH) increases muscle mass. GH is produced by the anterior pituitary and is involved in height, bone, and muscle growth. Testosterone also contributes to an increase in muscle mass. Option C. Decreases gastric motility – This option is incorrect because while T3 and T4 are involved in maintaining gastric motility, the under secretion of these hormones would cause a decrease in gastric motility. Hence, patients with hypothyroidism frequently experience a decrease in gastric motility. Rather than decreasing gastric motility, T3 and T4 instead function to increase gastric motility (i.e. more frequent bowel movements). Option D. Stimulates T-cell development – This option is incorrect because thymosins stimulate T-cell development. Thymosins are proteins produced by the thymus that stimulate white blood cells to become T-cells that identify and destroy infected cells. T-cells originate in the bone marrow, but they mature in the thymus. It is important for the test to understand that the thymus – where T-cell development occurs – is completely independent in structure and function from the thyroid (where thyroid hormones are produced) despite a passing similarity in name. Option E. Regulates blood calcium – This option is incorrect because calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are the hormones that regulate blood calcium levels. Calcitonin functions to lower blood calcium levels by stimulating osteoblast activity and suppressing osteoclast activity. Calcitonin also inhibits calcium from being released from the bone. On the other hand, PTH functions to increase blood calcium levels by stimulating calcium release from the bone. This calcium release increases osteocyte absorption of calcium from the bone and stimulates osteoclast activity. In contrast, the thyroid hormones have no role in regulation of blood calcium levels.",

HOX genes are a type of homeotic gene that is responsible for segmentation and placement of anatomic structures in an embryo, by turning on and off certain genes in certain segments of the body. This difference in gene expression affects which anatomic features develop in each segment. The homeobox sequence of the HOX genes is responsible for regulating anatomic features in the early stages of embryonic development. The image below shows the HOX genes involved in each segment of a fruit fly’s body. Small differences in HOX genes can alter the developmental process of related species. For example, while shrimps and grasshoppers are related species, they have very different physical structures caused by differences in HOX gene expression. Furthermore, mutations or deliberate manipulations to the HOX genes can cause certain anatomic structures to develop in the wrong segment of the body. For example, manipulated HOX genes can cause a leg to grow on the head of an organism. HOX genes tend to be highly conserved; hence, when these mutations occur, the organism often fails to develop properly. Since HOX genes control the development of structures in the appropriate segment along the head-tail axis, Option D is correct. CC BY 4.0",

I lac operon is instead responsible for the metabolism of lactose in prokaryotes. lacZ, in particular, codes for B-galactosidase that converts lactose into glucose and galactose. The regulatory genes of the lac operon produce an active repressor that binds to the operator and blocks RNA polymerase. When lactose is available, lactose binds to the repressor and inactivates it, allowing RNA polymerase to transcribe the genes so lactose can be metabolized when it is present. Option B. p53 – This option is incorrect because the p53 gene does not regulate the development of anatomic structures along the head-tail axis. As one of the tumor suppressor genes, the p53 gene encodes for a protein responsible for tumor suppression in a cell. Since the p53 gene controls cell repair and apoptosis, the down regulation of the p53 gene can lead to its inability to stop normal cell growth, potentially leading to cancer. Option C. SRY – This option is incorrect because the SRY gene or sex-determining region Y gene does not regulate the development of anatomic structures along the head-tail axis. The SRY gene is instead responsible for the production of the testis-determining factor protein.

The trp operon is instead responsible for tryptophan production in prokaryotes by producing enzymes for tryptophan synthesis. The regulatory genes of the trp operon produce an inactive repressor that allows RNA polymerase to ultimately produce tryptophan. When tryptophan is already available, tryptophan binds to the inactive repressor and activates it.

Once a stimulus causes gated ion channels to open and sodium ions to enter the axon, the neuron becomes depolarized. In the given graph, A represents a graded potential and B represents the depolarization of the neuron. If the threshold level (-50 to -55mV) is reached, an action potential is generated. This action potential results in the opening of voltage gated sodium ion channels down the entire length of the neuron. In the given graph, C represents the peak action potential of the neuron. At the peak action potential, voltage gated sodium ion channels close. In response to the significantly more positive membrane potential caused by the influx of sodium ions, more gated ion channels allow potassium ions to leave the cell, allowing the neuron to restore its resting state. This restoration of polarization is called repolarization and it is represented as D in the given graph. Following repolarization, voltage gated potassium ion channels are slow to close, causing too many potassium ions to be released from the cell and the membrane potential to drop. When there is such overcorrection of the membrane potential, the neuron is undergoing hyperpolarization , represented as E in the given graph. After hyperpolarization, the neuron goes through a refractory period in which the neuron will not respond to a new stimulus until sodium-potassium pumps return the ions and restore resting potential.

A neuron is depolarized when a stimulus causes gated ion channels to open and sodium ions to enter the axon. Hence, the membrane potential increases when depolarization occurs due to positively charged sodium ions entering the cell, until the neuron reaches peak action potential and the voltage gated sodium ion channels close. Option B. Activation of leaky potassium channels – This option is incorrect because leaky potassium channels are always open to help maintain resting potential; therefore, leaky potassium channels do not have to be activated to allow the flow of potassium ions. Resting potential is maintained by sodium-potassium pumps and leaky potassium channels. The sodium-potassium pumps, powered by ATP hydrolysis, let three sodium ions out and two potassium ions in. The leaky potassium channels let potassium ions out through passive ion leakage. Option C. Blocking of calcium channels – This option is incorrect because the blocking of calcium channels does not occur in nerve impulse transmission and therefore cannot be found in an action potential graph. The blocking of calcium channels can instead occur in transmission across chemical synapses. Depolarization leads to the opening of calcium channels and allows calcium ions to enter the cell. The influx of calcium ions causes the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. However, if calcium channels are blocked, calcium ions cannot enter the cell, preventing neurotransmitters from being released into the synaptic cleft. Option E. Acetylcholine recycling – This option is incorrect because acetylcholine recycling does not occur in nerve impulse transmission and therefore cannot be found in the given graph. Acetylcholine recycling instead occurs in transmission across chemical synapse. After acetylcholine molecules are released into the synaptic cleft, they are broken down by enzymes in the cleft for reuptake by the neurons.

      "concept_text": "Lungs are invaginated structures made of two sections: the left lung and the right lung. These structures have a membranous cover called the pleurae which has two pleura layers: the visceral pleura and the parietal pleura. The visceral pleura lines the surface of the lungs, while the parietal pleura lines the inside of the chest cavity. The pleura functions to protect and cushion the lungs. It also produces fluid that coats the pleura and acts as a lubricant between the lungs and the chest wall during breathing.  The space in between these two layers is called the intrapleural space. The intrapleural space has a lower pressure than the atmosphere. The pressure of the intrapleural space decreases as we inhale, since the lung cavity opens up and increases in volume during inhalation. Since the pleurae is a membranous cover that lines the lungs, Option B is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Alveoli – This option is incorrect because the alveoli do not cover the lungs; instead, they are small air sacs at the ends of bronchioles. Gas exchange between the circulatory system and the lungs occurs across capillaries wrapped around alveoli. The alveoli are coated with surfactant in order to reduce surface tension and prevent collapsing as we inhale and exhale. Option C. Cartilage – This option is incorrect because cartilage does not cover the lungs. Cartilage is an avascular connective tissue that can be found in the ear, nose, larynx, trachea, and joints. This soft and flexible tissue helps to reduce friction between bones and absorb shock in the joints. The trachea, specifically, contains C-shaped cartilage covered by cilia and mucus cells. This C-shaped cartilage provides structural support to the trachea and keeps the airway open. Option D. Gastrin – This option is incorrect because as a hormone of the digestive system, gastrin does not cover the surface of lungs. Gastrin is a peptide hormone secreted by G cells of the stomach. This hormone is absorbed into blood and stimulates parietal cells to secrete HCl. HCl creates an acidic environment in the stomach which is essential for the activation of pepsinogen into pepsin, which subsequently digests proteins. Option E. Blood – This option is incorrect because blood does not cover the surface of lungs. While lungs contain air sacs that are surrounded by networks of capillaries, blood itself does not cover the surface of lungs. Blood is a type of connective tissue that consists of plasma (liquid), serum, erythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white blood cells), and thrombocytes (platelets). Blood mainly functions to transport gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) and nutrients throughout the body.",

      "concept_text": "Classical conditioning occurs when an animal recognizes that events are connected. A well-known example of classical conditioning is Pavlov’s experiment. Dogs naturally salivate when presented with food. This salivation caused by food is called the unconditioned response as it is an innate reflex to an unconditioned stimulus —in this case, food. During his experiment, Pavlov rang a bell when food was presented. After some time, the dogs began to associate the sound of the bell with food. In the beginning of the experiment, ringing the bell without any food did not elicit a response in the dogs. However, at the end of the experiment, the dogs salivated at the sound of the bell without the presence of food. Therefore, the sound of the bell became a conditioned stimulus that caused a response even in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus. The salivation caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditioned response . In the situation presented in the question, a dog follows commands from his owner, expecting a treat in return. The treats, similar to the food used in Pavlov‘s experiment, are an unconditioned stimulus . The dog initially does not associate this unconditioned stimulus with the commands. However, after some time of training, the dog begins to associate the commands with the treats. The commands are now a conditioned stimulus that elicits a conditioned response from the dog—in this case, following of the command. Since a dog following commands to receive a treat is an example of classical conditioning, Option C is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Habituation – This option is incorrect because habituation is a learned behavior that allows individuals to ignore repetitive, inconsequential events. For example, anemones will not react to being repeatedly poked with a stick. Anemones usually react to contact because it may be food; however, after being repeatedly poked with a stick, anemones will learn that the stick is not food and perceive the event as inconsequential. Habituation does not explain the given behavior because in the question, the dog is not ignoring the commands of the owner. Option B. Sensitization – This option is incorrect because sensitization is an increased response to a repeated stimulus. Sensitization does not explain the given behavior because dogs do not show an increased response when their owners repeat the same commands. In this question, the dog shows the same response to the same command. Option D. Imprinting – This option is incorrect because imprinting is a rapid learning process in which young animals develop a long-lasting behavioral response to a specific individual or object. Imprinting is an innate behavior acquired during a critical/sensitive period of an organism, typically right after birth or hatching. An example of imprinting is when graylag goslings accept any moving object as their mother during their first day of life. Imprinting does not explain the given behavior because dogs following commands is a behavior acquired through training that does not necessarily happen during their early stages of life. Option E. Aposematic coloration – This option is incorrect because aposematic coloration is a conspicuous pattern or coloration of animals that warns predators that they should be avoided. For example, poisonous frogs have bright colors to warn predators of their toxicity. Aposematic coloration does not explain the given behavior because dogs following commands is a behavior that is completely unrelated to displayed warnings signs.",

Slime molds – This option is incorrect because slime molds are fungus-like protists that distinguish from fungi by NOT having chitin in their cell wall. While slime molds resemble fungi by forming filaments and spore-bearing bodies, their cell walls are made up of cellulose instead of chitin. There are two types of slime molds: cellular and plasmodial. While cellular slime molds reproduce asexually via mitosis, plasmodial slime mold cells fuse and form a diploid zygote. Option D.

In addition, phagocytotic white blood cells contain large amounts of lysosomes in order to break down consumed pathogens. Lysosomes are vesicles produced from the Golgi apparatus. Option C.

Option D. Nucleoid – This option is incorrect because the nucleoid is not an organelle and does not synthesize lipids. The nucleoid is a region of high chromosome density within prokaryotic cells. The prokaryotic genome is stored in the nucleoid, as prokaryotes lack a nucleus. Option E.

Examples of vacuoles include transport vacuoles, food vacuoles, central vacuoles, storage vacuoles, and contractile vacuoles. While transport vacuoles and food vacuoles can be found in any eukaryotic cell, central vacuoles and storage vacuoles can only be found in plant cells. Contractile vacuoles are found in single-celled protists such as amoeba and paramecium to allow them to survive hypotonic environments. Vacuoles are distinguished from vesicles as they tend to be larger and less transient.

      "concept_text": "Phospholipids are lipid molecules that consist of two fatty acids and one phosphate group joined to a glycerol backbone, as shown in the image below. The region with the two fatty acid tails is hydrophobic because this area consists entirely of nonpolar hydrocarbons. The other region is the hydrophilic head, consisting of the glycerol backbone and phosphate group. The ester linkage of the glycerol backbone and the negative charge of the phosphate group allow the hydrophilic head to interact with the polar water molecules in the aqueous solution. Since phospholipids have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions, they are amphipathic molecules. This amphipathic property means that a part of phospholipids (hydrophobic region) aims to aggregate together to avoid water, while the other part (hydrophilic region) spontaneously seeks to interact with water as much as possible. Hence, phospholipids are able to spontaneously form double-layered structures that consist of a hydrophobic interior layer and hydrophilic exterior layers. Since the question is asking to identify a molecule that can form a bilayer when placed in an aqueous solution, Option E is correct. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Albumins – This option is incorrect because albumins do not spontaneously form a bilayer in aqueous solutions. Albumins are simple, functional proteins that act as carriers or enzymes in the blood. By using their water-soluble properties, albumins help transport substances (such as fatty acids, hormones, ions, and vitamins), and also helps to maintain the osmotic pressure of the blood. Option B. Cholesterols – This option is incorrect because while cholesterols are also amphipathic lipid molecules, their four relatively bulky rings prevent them from packing in the same manner as phospholipids to form bilayers. Nevertheless, cholesterol plays an important role in the bilayer of cell membranes by maintaining membrane fluidity. Cell membranes are required to maintain a certain degree of fluidity and are capable of changing membrane fatty acid composition and incorporating cholesterol to do so. In cold weather, cell membranes become more rigid. To prevent the membrane from becoming too rigid, cholesterol is incorporated into the membrane to increase fluidity by helping prevent the phospholipids from packing together too tightly. In warm weather, cell membranes become more fluid. To prevent the membrane from collapsing due to excessive flexibility, cholesterol is added into the membrane to restrict fatty acid movement. Option C. Proteoglycans – This option is incorrect because proteoglycans do not spontaneously form a bilayer in aqueous solutions. Proteoglycans are heavily glycosylated proteins. In other words, they are proteins with attached carbohydrate groups. Depending on their type and structure, they may or may not have hydrophobic components. While some membrane proteoglycans have hydrophobic regions that span cell membranes, other proteoglycans lack a hydrophobic region. Furthermore, even if the proteoglycan is amphipathic, their relatively bulky size prevents them from packing in the same manner as phospholipids to form bilayers. Option D. Triglycerides – This option is incorrect because triglycerides do not spontaneously form a bilayer in aqueous solutions. While triglycerides are also lipid molecules, they lack a polar phosphate group and instead have a total of three fatty acid tails attached to a glycerol backbone. As triglycerides have three very hydrophobic fatty acid tails and lack the negative charge of a phosphate group, they are considered hydrophobic.",

      "concept_text": "To determine the inheritance pattern, we first need to identify whether the trait is dominant or recessive. The trait is dominant if one of the parents has the trait and the trait does NOT skip a generation. An indication of a recessive inheritance pattern is when two unaffected parents have an affected child. Two unaffected parents can have an affected child when they are both carriers of the affected allele (heterozygous) and they both pass down the affected allele to their child. Since 8 and 9 are both unaffected but have an affected child (17), we can know that the inheritance pattern is recessive. We can further confirm that the inheritance pattern is not dominant because of the “skipped generation”: Individual 1 is affected, none of his children are, but one of his grandchildren is affected. We then need to identify whether the chart displays an autosomal or sex-linked trait. In autosomal traits, males and females are likely to be affected in equal proportions because males and females have the same number of autosomes. On the other hand, males are more commonly affected by X-linked recessive traits because males only have one X chromosome, while females have two. Since males only have one X chromosome, there is no paired chromosome to offset the effect of the affected chromosome. Furthermore, Y-linked traits never occur in females because females lack a Y chromosome. However, gender ratio alone is not sufficient to confirm whether the condition is sex-linked. Remember that in X-linked recessive conditions, an affected mother will only have sons who are affected (because both the mother’s X chromosomes are affected for her to have the condition, the son must inherit and express one of his mother’s affected X chromosome). In this pedigree chart, an affected mother (4) has an unaffected son (9) so we know this condition cannot be X-linked recessive. Since the inheritance pattern is recessive and autosomal, Option D is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. X-linked recessive – This option is incorrect because X-linked recessive traits tend to show up in males more often than females, which is not seen in the given pedigree chart. Males are more prone to X-linked recessive traits because they only need to inherit one faulty chromosome to have the condition, as their second chromosome is a Y chromosome. If a male inherits an affected X chromosome from his mother, there is no paired chromosome to offset the effect of the affected chromosome. In addition to gender ratio, if the trait were to be X-linked recessive, an affected mother should only have sons that are affected. However, in the given pedigree chart, an affected mother (4) has an unaffected son (9); therefore, the condition cannot be X-linked recessive. Option B. X-linked dominant – This option is incorrect because if the trait were to be X-linked dominant, all daughters of an affected father will be affected. All daughters of an affected father will be affected because females inherit one X chromosome from their father and in this case, that chromosome will be an affected chromosome. Due to the dominant nature of the condition, the daughter would always have the condition. However, in the given pedigree chart, an affected father (1) gave birth to unaffected daughters (7, 8); therefore, the condition cannot be X-linked dominant. Option C. Autosomal dominant – This option is incorrect because autosomal dominant traits do not skip a generation if one parent is affected. In the given pedigree chart, while 1 is affected by the trait, none of his children (6, 7, 8) are affected. If the trait were to be autosomal dominant, individuals 6, 7, and 8 would not have affected offspring of their own because autosomal dominant conditions do not “skip” a generation. However, individual 6 has an affected child (13) and individual 8 has an affected child (17); therefore, the condition cannot be autosomal dominant. Option E. Y-linked – This option is incorrect because there are affected females in the given pedigree chart. Only males are affected by Y-linked traits because females lack a Y chromosome.",

The densest component spins out into a solid pellet layer at the bottom of the tube first, while the least dense component separates last. The order of separation is shown in the image below. The first layer to separate contains the nuclei. The next layer contains mitochondria and chloroplasts. The next layer contains microsomes and small vesicles. The final layer contains ribosomes, viruses, and larger macromolecules. In this sequence, after a round of centrifugation, the solid pellet layer is removed from the remaining non-pellet portion.

Hence, we can infer that the species went through parallel evolution in which they made similar evolutionary changes after their divergence from a common ancestor. Since the two species of monkeys underwent parallel evolution in which they share a common ancestor and possess similar evolutionary features, Option E is correct. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Convergent – This option is incorrect because convergent evolution occurs when two unrelated species that do not share a common ancestor evolve to share similar traits. Since the two species of monkeys emerged from a common ancestor and therefore are related, convergent evolution could not have taken place. An example of convergent evolution is the relationship between insect and bat wings. While insect and bat wing share functional similarities (function of flight), insects and bats do not share a common ancestor. Option B. Divergent – This option is incorrect because divergent evolution occurs when two related species become increasingly different over time as a result of speciation. While the two species of monkeys did split from a common ancestor, they did not become increasingly different over time. In fact, the two species of monkeys continued to evolve similar features including prehensile tails and increased upper arm strength. An example of divergent evolution are the finches of the Galapagos. The beak of the ancestral species of finches evolved over time to adapt to different food sources. Hence, beak shape and size now vary among finch species. Option C. Analogous – This option is incorrect because analogous evolution refers to the development of analogous structures, which are body parts that resemble one another between unrelated species due to adaptations to similar environments (e.g., bat wings vs. bee wings). Since the two species of monkeys emerged from a common ancestor, ‘analogous evolution’ could not have taken place. Option D. Coevolution – This option is incorrect because coevolution is an evolutionary relationship between two species in which one species causes the other one to evolve and vice versa. Hence, coevolution results in the evolution of both species. Since the two species of monkeys did not cause each other to evolve, coevolution did not take place. An example of coevolution is the relationship between predators and prey. The evolution of a more effective predator causes the prey to evolve better ways to defend itself. Similarly, the evolution of a more effective prey causes the predator to evolve better ways to capture the prey.",

      "concept_text": "Arthropods , including most insects and mollusks, have an open circulatory system. The open circulatory system pumps blood into an internal cavity called the hemocoel , which soaks tissues in a bath of hemolymph . The hemolymph contains oxygen and nutrients necessary for the functioning of organs. The hemolymph eventually returns to the pumping mechanism through holes called ostia. On the other hand, the closed circulatory system transports blood via arteries, veins, and capillaries. The open circulatory system is inefficient compared to the closed circulatory system for numerous reasons. Closed circulatory systems have more directed blood flow and a higher blood pressure, allowing a faster flow of blood. Furthermore, unlike open circulatory systems, most closed circulatory systems separate oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood. By isolating oxygenated blood, oxygen can be transported faster to tissues without being “contaminated” by deoxygenated blood that lacks oxygen. The blood in closed circulatory systems also has a higher carrying capacity for oxygen, allowing larger amounts of oxygen to be bound to hemoglobin and transported throughout the body. Therefore, closed circulatory systems can transport oxygen faster and allow a more efficient respiratory system. Since the open circulatory system contributes to slower oxygen transport and inefficient gas exchange, Option C is correct.",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Increased alveoli – This option is incorrect because increased alveoli can be found in efficient respiratory systems. Alveoli are small air sacs that allow gas exchange between the circulatory system and the lungs. Since alveoli are sites of gas exchange, increasing the number of alveoli will lead to more efficient respiration as there is increased surface area for gas exchange and more sites for oxygen to enter the blood and carbon dioxide to leave. Option B. Moist skin – This option is incorrect because moist skin can be found in efficient respiratory systems. Annelids secrete mucus to create a moist surface for gas exchange via diffusion. Some arthropods, including grasshoppers, have moistened tracheal endings to ease the rate of diffusion. Since gases including oxygen and carbon dioxide dissolve more easily in water, the moisture keeps the skin permeable and facilitates the absorption of these gases into the skin. Option D. Feathery gills – This option is incorrect because feathery gills can be found in efficient respiratory systems. “Feathery” gills provide a large surface area for gas exchange to occur. This feature is particularly important for aquatic organisms because water contains extremely low levels of dissolved oxygen. Hence, it is important for aquatic organisms to maximize the surface area of their respiratory systems. Don’t be thrown off by the use of the word “feathery” in this answer choice – feathery is simply a term used to describe the appearance of the gills in some fish, and should not be confused with actual feathers.",

      "concept_text": "A plant is made up of many different parts. The three main parts are the roots, the leaves, and the stem. The structure of plant roots, leaves, and stems facilitates the transport of water and nutrients throughout the plant. The phloem and xylem are the main vascular tissues responsible for this movement. The phloem transports sugar, while the xylem transports water and minerals. As shown in the image below, t he xylem is composed of two types of cells: tracheids and vessel elements. Tracheids are elongated cells with tapered ends. They allow water and minerals to pass laterally by moving between openings in their walls from one tracheid cell to the next. Tracheids also provide structural support to the plant. Vessel elements are shorter and wider cells that combine to form a column called a vessel. Vessels have perforations that allow water to pass through vertically from one vessel element to another. Since tracheids are xylem cells that function to transport water and minerals throughout a plant, Option B is correct. CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A. Photosynthesize – This option is incorrect because chloroplasts are involved in photosynthesis, not tracheids. Chloroplasts are organelles unique to plant cells that produce energy through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen. Chlorophyll, the green pigment inside chloroplasts, captures light energy from sunlight in order to carry out photosynthesis. Option C. Transport sugars – This option is incorrect because the phloem is involved in transporting sugars and other organic nutrients. The phloem is made of cells called sieve-tube members that form fluid-conducting columns called sieve tubes. These cells lack nuclei and ribosomes. Sieve tubes are associated with companion cells that supply sugar to the phloem. These sieve tubes are connected to one another by plasmodesmata to maintain structure. Option D. Absorb water – This option is incorrect because tracheids are involved in the transport of water, not absorption. Roots, specifically root hair cells, are responsible for the absorption of water and minerals from the soil. In addition to absorbing water and minerals, roots function to anchor the plant into the soil. Vascular plants (tracheophytes) have true roots, while nonvascular plants such as bryophytes do not. Option E. Absorb energy from the sun – This option is incorrect because molecules of light-absorbing pigments called chlorophyll contained in the chloroplasts absorb energy in the form of light from the sun. Light is then incorporated into electrons, causing them to be excited and lose stability. These excited electrons re-emit the absorbed energy which is then reabsorbed by electrons in adjacent pigment molecules.",

      "concept_text": "The Miller–Urey experiment was a chemical experiment that simulated the conditions of the primordial, early Earth and tested the chemical origin of life under those conditions. The image below shows the setup of the experiment that utilized a closed system. American chemists Harold Urey and Stanley Miller combined warm water with water vapor, methane, ammonia, and molecular hydrogen. This gaseous mixture was then pulsed with high-voltage electrical discharges. These components were meant to simulate the primitive ocean, heat, lightning, and the prebiotic atmosphere. Miller and Urey collected the products of the experiment in liquid form by using a condenser. A week later, they found that simple organic molecules such as amino acids had formed. In addition to amino acids, they found several fatty acids, carbon monoxide, and aldehydes as well. Thus, the Miller-Urey experiment successfully produced organic molecules from inorganic components thought to have been present on the prebiotic Earth. Since amino acids were an important organic molecule synthesized during the Miller-Urey experiment, Option E is correct. CC BY 4.0",

Glycogen – This option is incorrect because glycogen was not a product of the Miller-Urey experiment that simulated the conditions thought to be present on early Earth. Glycogen is an α-glucose polymer that stores energy in animal cells. Option C.

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a source of energy at the cellular level. It stores its potential energy in the form of chemical energy. ATP is produced in the mitochondria through a process called phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is the process in which ADP (adenosine diphosphate) combines with phosphate to form ATP.",
