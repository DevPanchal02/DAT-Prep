      "concept_text": "This question is asking about the commonly tested concept of tonicity. Tonicity is defined as the relative concentration of two solutions that are separated by a semipermeable membrane. For the test, the two solutions being compared are often the cytoplasm within a cell and the extracellular environment. There are three terms used to categorize tonicity: hypertonic , isotonic , and hypotonic . When explaining tonicity, this solution will describe the extracellular environment's tonicity as it relates to the cell. A hypertonic solution is a solution that contains a higher concentration of solutes than the relative opposing solution. Let’s say a cell was placed in a hypertonic solution. In this case, the solution that the cell is being placed in contains a greater concentration of solutes than the cell’s cytoplasm. As a result, water will exit the cell via osmosis to equalize the relative concentration of solutes on both sides of the semipermeable cell membrane. Water will always flow from either low to high solute concentration OR high to low water concentration. Cells that are placed in hypertonic solutions will shrivel due to water leaving the cell. If the cell has a cell wall (plant cells), the cell wall will dissociate from the cell membrane through a process known as plasmolysis. Keep in mind that tonicity is relative. If the extracellular environment is hypertonic relative to the cell, it can also be said that the cell is hypotonic relative to the extracellular environment. An isotonic solution is one where the relative concentration of solutes of both solutions on either side of the semipermeable membrane is the same. In this case, there is no net movement of water across the semipermeable membrane because there is no difference in solute concentration that must be equalized. Because there is no net movement of water across the membrane, the morphology of the cell does not change. Animal cells prefer isotonic environments. A hypotonic solution is a solution that contains a lower concentration of solutes than the relative opposing solution. If a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution (such as distilled water), the extracellular solution contains a lower concentration of solutes than the cell’s cytoplasm. This will lead to water from the extracellular environment diffusing into the cell via osmosis to equalize the relative concentration of solutes on either side of the semipermeable membrane. As a result, the cell will swell due to an increase in water within the cell. If too much water enters the cell, the cell will burst (lyse) through a process known as cytolysis . Concerning the question, when the red blood cell is placed in distilled water, the distilled water is hypotonic relative to the cell. This means that the distilled water has a lower solute concentration than the cytoplasm within the cell. As a result, water will diffuse into the cell to equalize the solute concentration on both sides of the plasma membrane which will cause the cell to swell and eventually lyse. Therefore, Option B . Burst is the correct answer. Here is an illustration to help visualize this concept: CC BY 4.0",
      "poe_text": "Option A . Plasmolysis – This option is incorrect because plasmolysis is the detachment of a cell wall due to the cell being placed in a hypertonic solution. This process can only occur in cells with a cell wall (such as fungi or plant cells). Because red blood cells don’t have a cell wall, they cannot undergo plasmolysis. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option C . Shrivel – This option is incorrect because when a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water will diffuse into the cell resulting in the swelling or bursting of the cell (cytolysis), which is the opposite effect of shriveling. Remember that when a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, the concentration of solutes inside the cell is greater than the concentration of solutes in the extracellular environment. As a result, water will diffuse into the cell via osmosis to equalize the concentration gradient. A cell would shrivel if it were placed in a hypertonic solution. Option D . Formation of an endospore – This option is incorrect . Recall that an endospore is a dormant and highly resistant structure that bacteria form under times of stress. Endospores protect the genetic material of the cell in the presence of extreme temperatures, lack of nutrients, and harmful chemicals. Endospores are primarily formed from gram-positive bacteria but can also be produced by some gram-negative bacteria. This question does not specifically state that the cell in question is a bacterium. A hypotonic solution would also not lead to the formation of an endospore; therefore, this option is incorrect. Option E . Remain the same – This option is incorrect . A red blood cell would remain the same size and morphology in an isotonic solution, not a hypotonic solution. In an isotonic solution, the concentration of solutes is equal on both sides of the semipermeable membrane, therefore, there would be no net movement of water into or out of the cell. The question specifically asks what would happen when a red blood cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, not an isotonic solution. In a hypotonic solution, water would enter the cell via osmosis and cause the cell to swell and burst (cytolysis).",
